Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\\n\\nYou wouldn\'t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what\'s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\\n\\nThat\'s how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol","percentile_10_comment":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That\u2019s why you feel like you have no energy.  It\u2019s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it\u2019s worth it.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve been in a similar loop with ADHD meds, caffeine, lousy food, and guilt, so here\u2019s what\u2019s actually helped me crawl out of the spiral and get some real traction.\\n\\nTreat the medicated and un\u2011medicated days as two different \u201cmodes\u201d with their own expectations. On Vyvanse days aim for the heavy cognitive stuff (studying, trading practice, paperwork) and block it in short \u201cwork sprints\u201d\u201425 minutes of focus, 5 minutes off, three rounds, then a longer break. Put just three must\u2011do items on the schedule; finishing them earns you a win, everything else is extra credit. On off\u2011days switch the goal to recovery and low\u2011bandwidth habits: meal\u2011prep, laundry, a walk, stretching, refilling your water bottle every time you open the fridge. When the bar is realistic you stop burning willpower on beating yourself up.\\n\\nFood: decide it once, not three times a day. Sunday evening plan five simple, repeatable meals you don\u2019t hate (e.g., overnight oats, rotisserie\u2011chicken salad kits, frozen veg + rice + sauce). Prep or portion them right away so \u201cwhat should I eat?\u201d never becomes a question. Store junk food somewhere you\u2019d have to leave the house to get\u2014future\u2011you rarely wants to put on shoes just for Oreos. For water, tie it to something you already do: every bathroom break = 8 oz, every coffee = finish a full bottle first. If plain water is painful, add zero\u2011calorie flavor drops or go bubbly.\\n\\nMovement: 10\u2011minute micro\u2011workouts beat zero\u2011minute perfect workouts. Bodyweight circuits, YouTube yoga, or a brisk walk around the block keep the streak alive on lethargic days and blunt the urge to binge. Momentum matters more than intensity.\\n\\nPhones and dopamine: put your most distracting apps in a folder called \u201cLater\u201d on the last screen, turn on grayscale after 9\xa0p.m., and leave the charger across the room so grabbing the phone is an active choice. When the itch hits, set a 10\u2011minute timer\u2014if you still want to scroll after it rings, go ahead; half the time the urge passes.\\n\\nPlan for the inevitable crash days: write a short rescue checklist (\u201cdrink water, shower, 10\u2011min walk, text a friend\u201d) and tape it where you\u2019ll see it first thing. Following it keeps a bad day from becoming a bad week.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t confuse discipline with punishment. You\u2019re not broken; your brain just needs clearer systems than most people\u2019s. Nail one small ritual at a time, celebrate it, then stack the next one on top. Six months of that beats any heroic Monday\u2011morning overhaul. You already care enough to ask for help\u2014that\u2019s the hardest part. Now give yourself permission to improve in boring, unsexy, relentlessly consistent steps. It works.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re trying to run a high-friction life on raw willpower. ADHD + BED means you need systems that remove friction and stabilize your energy, not heroic motivation.\\n\\nFirst, the meds. Two-day \u201cholidays\u201d can cause rebound appetite, lethargy, and binges. If you\u2019re on Vyvanse partly for BED, those off-days are likely pouring gasoline on the problem. Ask your prescriber if breaks are actually necessary, and if not, try consistent dosing and timing. If you do keep off-days, give them a specific playbook so they don\u2019t turn into chaos.\\n\\nCreate two modes: on-med days = deep work days, off-med days = maintenance days. On-med: one or two 45\u201360 min focus blocks for the hardest stuff (trading study, school), then anything extra is a bonus. Off-med: errands, laundry, meal prep, light workouts, admin. Stop holding both days to the same standard.\\n\\nGive yourself a Minimum Viable Day that happens no matter what: 10 minutes of movement, 1 liter of water before noon, 3 structured meals. That\u2019s it. If you do more, great, but the MVD keeps you from spiraling. Discipline is mostly keeping your minimums.\\n\\nFor binge eating, stop the restrict\u2013binge cycle. Even if Vyvanse blunts appetite, still eat regular meals. Set predictable times: breakfast within 60\u201390 minutes of waking, lunch, dinner, plus 1\u20132 planned snacks. Build each meal around protein, fiber, and volume: example breakfast could be Greek yogurt with berries and granola; lunch could be a protein wrap with veggies and an apple; dinner a lean protein, a big pile of veggies, and a carb you enjoy. Pre-decide tomorrow\u2019s meals the night before to reduce decision fatigue. Keep trigger foods out of the house or buy them in single-serve portions. When an urge hits, delay 10 minutes, drink water or tea, change rooms, and set a timer; most urges crest and pass. If a binge happens, the very next meal is normal and boring; no \u201cmake up for it\u201d restriction.\\n\\nHydration: make it stupid-easy. Fill a large bottle at night and put it where you\u2019ll see it in the morning. Drink 10 big sips before coffee. Use a zero-sugar electrolyte if plain water is hard. Aim for finishing one bottle by noon and another by dinner. Every time you pee, take 5\u201310 sips. That habit stack works.\\n\\nMovement and energy: off-med days don\u2019t have to be gym days. Do a 10\u201320 minute walk outside right after waking. Light exposure + movement will do more for energy and appetite regulation than another coffee. If you can, add a super simple strength routine three times a week: 2 sets each of squats, pushups (incline if needed), hip hinges, and rows. Keep it under 20 minutes so you don\u2019t negotiate with yourself.\\n\\nPhone dopamine: make distraction physically inconvenient. Put your phone on grayscale, move social apps to a folder on the last page, and set app limits. During focus blocks, leave the phone in another room and use Do Not Disturb. Keep a scratch pad beside you; when a thought pops up, write it down and return to the task. That tiny move saves a ton of tab-hopping.\\n\\nFocus system: use the 5-minute rule. Tell yourself you\u2019ll start for five minutes; momentum usually carries you. Try 25/5 or 45/10 timers. Body doubling is gold for ADHD\u2014study in a library, sit with a friend, or use Focusmate/lofi coworking streams. For trading, make it concrete: \u201cFrom 10:00\u201310:45 I read chapter X and take notes; 10:45\u201311:00 I practice one setup and log it.\u201d Open-ended \u201clearn trading\u201d is a trap.\\n\\nSleep and caffeine: consistency beats perfection. Same wake time daily, even weekends. Limit caffeine after noon to protect sleep. If you\u2019re a heavy user, taper slowly over a week or two instead of trying to quit overnight; swap some cups for tea or half-caf. Better sleep will help cravings and focus more than another stimulant.\\n\\nEnvironment > willpower. Set out breakfast dishes and fill your water the night before. Prep protein and easy veggies on Sundays. Put running shoes by the door. Hide the junk food; put fruit in sight. What\u2019s visible gets done.\\n\\nWhen you fall off, use the two-day rule: never miss twice. If Monday was a wash, Tuesday is an MVD day and you\u2019re back on track. Review your week every Sunday for 10 minutes: what worked, what snagged you, what tiny tweak for next week. Iterate; don\u2019t overhaul.\\n\\nIf you can, get a therapist or dietitian who treats BED (CBT-E/DBT). The goal isn\u2019t to be perfect; it\u2019s to make binges less frequent, less intense, and shorter\u2014and to keep moving forward in between.\\n\\nYou asked how to \u201crewire your brain.\u201d This is it. Regular meals and sleep stabilize your biology. Tiny consistent wins retrain your attention. Environment shifts make the good choice the default. Your identity follows your actions. Start with the MVD and one focus block a day. Seven straight days of that will feel different than what you\u2019re doing now.\\n\\nYou\u2019ve got a lot going for you.

That\u2019s enough to start making deliberate moves instead of drifting. Try treating the next twelve months like a personal turnaround plan with three pillars\u2014income, structure, and community.\\n\\nIncome first. Turn job\u2011hunting into a daily habit, not a mood\u2011based activity. Pick a set time each weekday (say 9\u201111am) where the phone goes on airplane mode and you do one thing that moves the ball: tweak the r\xe9sum\xe9, send applications, follow up on an old lead, or take an online micro\u2011course that upgrades a line on your CV. Track it on paper so you can literally see the streak build. Momentum here will reduce a lot of the background anxiety you\u2019ve got about the future.\\n\\nStructure next. You already work out; expand that into a simple morning routine that starts the day on rails: wake at the same time, drink water, make the bed, 15\u2011minute walk, then your workout. Lay clothes out the night before so there\u2019s zero decision fatigue. When the routine becomes automatic you free up willpower for bigger goals.\\n\\nCommunity last, but crucial. Isolation makes everything else harder. The fastest, cheapest way to get around people who won\u2019t ghost you is volunteering. Animal shelters, food banks, park cleanups\u2014pick something that takes two or three hours a week. You\u2019ll add structure, meet people who value contribution over social polish, and you may stumble into job leads. If you enjoy fitness, consider a group class or even studying for a personal\u2011trainer cert; that turns an existing interest into a social and possibly paid activity.\\n\\nExpect awkwardness at first. Do it anyway, log it, and see how you feel after thirty days. If emotions stay rough, add a therapist to the mix; savings are well spent on getting your mind running clean.\\n\\nThe short version: one disciplined job\u2011search block a day, one locked\u2011in morning routine, one weekly commitment that puts you around other humans. Keep those promises to yourself for a quarter and your life will look noticeably different\u2014maybe not \u201cfixed,\u201d but moving, and that\u2019s what counts.

Keep lifting, but make the walk non\u2011negotiable even on rest days.\\n\\nGive yourself a daily work block before noon, no matter what: 2\u20134 hours, timer on, no doom\u2011scrolling. Split it between job search and skill. Track applications in a simple spreadsheet and set a weekly target (e.g., 50 tailored applications or outreach messages, with daily follow\u2011ups). If you need cash and momentum quickly, commit to landing any paycheck within two weeks: cafe, warehouse, delivery, or front desk at a gym. Structure > perfect job right now. In parallel, pick one marketable skill to level up 60 minutes a day (Excel, CPR/first aid if you want to work in fitness, customer service scripts, basic sales). Small daily progress compounds.\\n\\nLeverage fitness to make a difference and meet people. Offer two free beginner sessions a week at a local park and invite others. Post a simple flyer on community boards and in local Facebook/Nextdoor groups. Ask attendees for a testimonial and referrals. Or apply to front\u2011desk/assistant roles at nearby gyms; it puts you around people, builds a network, and can lead to training clients.\\n\\nBuild social reps, not instant friendships. Aim to talk to three humans a day, even tiny interactions. Pick one recurring group where people show up weekly\u2014volunteer shift at a food bank, animal shelter, run club, Toastmasters, church/community cleanups\u2014and commit to 8 straight weeks. Say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m [Name]. I\u2019m new here.\u201d That\u2019s enough. Text your parents twice a week with a short update; consistency matters more than depth.\\n\\nCreate a simple night shutdown: 15\u2011minute tidy, lay out clothes, set tomorrow\u2019s top 3 tasks on an index card, and write a 3\u2011line journal (what I did, what I\u2019ll do tomorrow, one thing I\u2019m grateful for). Aim for 7\u20138 hours of sleep. Cut back on numbing habits that wreck momentum (binge scrolling, booze, porn). If dating causes chaos, take a 60\u2011day break while you stabilize.\\n\\nUse a wall calendar and put an X for each day you hit the basics: wake on time, walk, work block, one social rep, shutdown. Don\u2019t break the chain. When you miss, don\u2019t spiral\u2014just don\u2019t miss twice.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to \u201cfix your life\u201d all at once. You need a boring day that you repeat: wake, walk, work, lift, one human interaction, shutdown.

A fancy coffee, an episode of a favorite show, 15 guilt\u2011free minutes on a game, or a walk in a park all work.

The trick is to make rewards immediate, small, and aligned with the person you\u2019re trying to become\u2014so they reinforce the habit instead of undoing it.\\n\\nUse three layers. First, an instant \u201cmicro-reward\u201d right after you finish: quick checkmark on a tracker, a one-sentence win log (\u201cKept a promise to myself\u201d), a 2\u20135 minute break you look forward to like a stretch, a short walk in sunlight, a fancy coffee/tea, or one song you only play after completing the task.

Set a timer so it stays a treat, not a new rabbit hole.\\n\\nThird, milestone rewards that make the habit easier or celebrate progress without backsliding: after 10 sessions, upgrade gear, buy a helpful book/app, plan a fun outing, or move $5\u2013$10 per session into a \u201cfun fund\u201d and spend it at 10\u201320 sessions. This ties consistency to something tangible.\\n\\nA few guardrails: don\u2019t use the behavior you\u2019re trying to cut as the reward (junk food for a diet, endless scrolling after deep work). Timebox rewards. Keep the reward separate from the task so you don\u2019t start bargaining (\u201cIf I do extra, I get extra\u201d).

My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I\'m at the point where I\'m losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'m not a therapist but I don\'t think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\\n\\nThe advice given by others is good but I\'d like to add some that I haven\'t seen mentioned:\\n\\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it\'s questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\\n\\nThat\'s what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I\'m no therapist. I\'m just sharing what has worked for me.\\n\\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I\'m my own daughter. No, I\'m not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it\'s hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\\n\\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\\n\\nGood luck!","percentile_10_comment":"Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don\'t suppress it, it will just bottle up and that\'s not good.

The trick is separating the moment you feel an emotion from the moment you act on it. One simple way is the \u201cpause and label\u201d habit: when something hits you, name the emotion out loud or in writing (\u201cthat\u2019s anger,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s disappointment\u201d). The tiny act of labeling moves the experience from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, giving you a short window to think instead of react.\\n\\nWhile you\u2019re in that window, run a preset protocol rather than ad\u2011libbing. Mine is a notebook page with three questions: What exactly happened? What do I want to do right now? What would I tell a friend to do? Writing it forces me to translate raw feelings into concrete statements, and looking at that third answer often exposes the gap between impulse and wisdom. If I\u2019m still unsure, I wait 24 hours before taking any irreversible action\u2014love confessions, angry emails, quitting a job, whatever. Most emotional whiplash cools off in a day; if it still feels right after the wait, I trust it more.\\n\\nBuild a daily practice that trains this skill when the stakes are low. Ten minutes of mindfulness meditation or breath counting literally rewires the brain for better impulse control; five minutes of journaling each morning keeps a running log of patterns that cloud your judgment. Physical outlets help too\u2014lifting, running, even walks\u2014because a calm nervous system is easier to reason with.\\n\\nFinally, decide once, not every time. For recurring situations (dating red flags, spending limits, staying up late), write a short set of personal policies while you\u2019re calm. Next time your emotions flare, the decision is already made and you just follow the policy, no debate required.\\n\\nYou\u2019re not weak for feeling things strongly; you just need a system that catches the emotion, channels it, and lets logic have its say. Give the above a 30\u2011day trial, track your results, and adjust. It\u2019s work, but it beats letting every spike of feeling steer the wheel.","comment_gpt5":"You don\u2019t need to suppress emotions; you need a system that keeps emotions from steering the wheel. Decide your rules when you\u2019re calm and follow them when you\u2019re hot.\\n\\nAdopt a hard pause. No big decisions while your heart rate is up. Use a 24-hour rule for anything with stakes. In that window, do three things: name the emotion out loud (\u201cthis is anger/hope/fear\u201d), regulate physiology (box breathing: 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold for 3\u20135 minutes), and write a one-page note separating facts from story. Facts = what actually happened. Story = what you\u2019re predicting or hoping.\\n\\nPre-commit bright-line rules aligned with your values. Examples: \u201cIf I don\u2019t see consistent reciprocity for X weeks, I step back.\u201d \u201cIf trust is broken twice, I pause contact for Y days and reassess.\u201d Write these when calm and keep them somewhere visible. When the moment comes, you\u2019re executing a policy, not debating a feeling.\\n\\nUse if-then plans to handle surges. If I feel the urge to chase, then I put my phone away, set a 10-minute timer, take a brisk walk, and fill out my facts-vs-story note. If I feel betrayed, then I schedule a conversation for tomorrow and draft my questions now.\\n\\nRun decisions through a quick checklist: does this align with my top 3 priorities, would I recommend it to a friend in my shoes, and will it matter in 10 days/10 months/10 years? If it fails two of these, the answer is no or not yet.\\n\\nLower your emotional baseline with daily reps: 10 minutes of mindfulness (count breaths, gently return when distracted), consistent sleep, and regular exercise.

What should I do?\\n\\nI\'m a stereotype loser. I\'m 26. I still live with my parents. I have a low paying job that doesn\'t translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \\n\\nIt\'s not like I didn\'t try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn\'t even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that\'s worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. \\n\\nI have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I\'m tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can\'t even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. \\n\\nHow can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.\\n\\nEdit: I didn\'t think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted. There are a lot of people who posted really thoughtful things and I appreciate that.","comments":{"best_comment":"26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you\'re most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\\n\\nLife is short, but it\'s longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone\'s success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\\n\\nFigure out what you want - it doesn\'t have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \\"to travel the world\\" or \\"to buy a house\\" or \\"get married and raise a family\\" or as simple as \\"get a job that lets you live comfortably\\". Figure out what it is.\\n\\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what\'s important to you and start today, then do it every day.\\n\\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it\'s get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it\'s getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \\n\\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That\'s okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\\n\\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer. If I was in your position, I would start there.","percentile_10_comment":"It\'s hard to do something you like when you don\'t even know what you like \ud83d\ude14","comment_o3":"First thing: if the suicidal thoughts ramp up again, call 988 (US) or whatever the crisis line is where you live and tell someone right away. Staying alive has to be priority one or none of the other advice matters.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything at once. Pick one daily anchor habit that\u2019s so small it feels almost silly, then protect it at all costs for the next two weeks. A brisk 10\u2011minute walk right after waking up is the one I recommend most because it checks several boxes: sunlight, movement, time away from screens, and a clear \u201cI did something\u201d win before the day even starts. Your brain needs repeated proof that you can set a goal and follow through, even a tiny one.\\n\\nOnce the walk feels automatic, add the next brick: spend 30 minutes every weekday learning a marketable skill. It could be Google\u2019s free IT Support cert, basic Excel on YouTube, copy\u2011editing on Coursera, or a community\u2011college HVAC evening class\u2014whatever looks remotely interesting and leads to a job that hires. You already proved you can finish a degree, so you have the grit; you just need a direction that actually pays. If you truly don\u2019t care which field, lean toward something short, cheap, and in demand so you see progress fast.\\n\\nDebt can feel overwhelming, but lenders mostly just want regular minimum payments. Open the statement, write the number down, and set up autopay so you never have to look at it again except once a month. That simple step moves the debt from \u201cmonster under the bed\u201d to \u201cscheduled bill,\u201d which frees mental bandwidth.\\n\\nUse your low\u2011stress living situation to your advantage instead of as a badge of shame. Parents\u2019 house = low overhead. That buys you time to train, stack cash, and stabilize your headspace without rent breathing down your neck.\\n\\nLast piece: get a therapist if you can, and if meds help you stay functional, that\u2019s a win, not a weakness. Discipline is easier when your chemistry isn\u2019t fighting you the whole way.\\n\\nTL;DR: tiny daily win (walk), dedicated skill block (30 min), autopay the debt, leverage cheap living, keep the mental\u2011health safety net in place.

If you\u2019re having active thoughts of harming yourself or anyone else, treat it like a medical emergency. In the US call or text 988, or contact your local emergency number. If you\u2019re elsewhere, look up your country\u2019s crisis line and save it in your phone. Tell your prescriber exactly what you wrote here; meds that keep you barely afloat might need an adjustment. If you can, get on a therapy waitlist; CBT for intrusive thoughts is practical and skills-based.\\n\\nNow, stabilize your baseline. For the next 14 days, keep it absurdly simple: wake up and go to bed at roughly the same time, get 10\u201320 minutes of daylight and a slow walk before noon, eat one decent protein-heavy meal, shower and brush, and spend 15 minutes tidying your space. That\u2019s it. Set alarms. Check each thing off on paper. Consistency first, intensity later.\\n\\nUse \u201cno zero days.\u201d When your brain says \u201cwhy bother,\u201d do five minutes anyway. A single Pomodoro (25 minutes) counts. Put your phone in another room, start a kitchen timer, and work until it dings. Track streaks on a calendar. When you break a streak, your only job is to start a new one the next day.\\n\\nCareer-wise, pick one lane for the next 90 days. Don\u2019t chase 10 things. Two solid options given your background and constraints:\\n\\nTech-adjacent. Journalism isn\u2019t useless. It maps to technical writing, content marketing/SEO, customer support, and documentation. Start a portfolio this week. Pick three everyday products or open-source tools, write simple \u201chow to\u201d guides and quickstart docs, and publish them on a free site or GitHub Pages. Take a basic course like Google IT Support, freeCodeCamp\u2019s responsive web design, or CompTIA A+ materials for foundational literacy; study 45\u201390 minutes a day. After two weeks of consistent study, start sending two targeted applications a day for help desk, QA, support, junior tech writer, or content roles. Your selling point is clear writing and the ability to learn; your portfolio proves it.\\n\\nTrades/operations. If you want something tangible and in-demand, look at apprenticeships or certs like electrician, HVAC, welding, CDL, or logistics/warehouse supervisor tracks. Call three local shops or unions, ask about apprenticeships, pay during training, and how to apply. Show up on time, work hard, advance quickly. Many of these pay well without needing higher math.\\n\\nIf math blocked you before but you still like STEM, rebuild it, but do it the disciplined way: 20 minutes a day, every day, starting with Khan Academy Arithmetic/Algebra. Don\u2019t \u201cstudy,\u201d just do the exercises and keep a streak. Six months of that beats three weeks of cramming and quitting.\\n\\nMoney: $30k sucks but it\u2019s common and solvable. If it\u2019s federal, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan so the payment is manageable. Set up autopay. Track spending with a simple spreadsheet and cut the top two leaks. If you can add a weekend shift temporarily, do it for three months to build a small emergency fund. Momentum quiets anxiety.\\n\\nSocial and environment matter. Get out of the house daily, even if it\u2019s only to sit in a library or gym for an hour. Consider one small volunteer gig or group class each week; it gives structure and adds lines to your resume.\\n\\nExpect it to feel dull, not inspiring. That\u2019s fine. The goal isn\u2019t to feel great; it\u2019s to do the next right thing today. If you run the plan above\u2014daily basics, 45\u201390 minutes of focused skill/portfolio work, and steady applications\u2014for 60\u201390 days, your life will look different. In 6\u201312 months, dramatically different.\\n\\nYou\u2019re not broken; you\u2019re stuck. Stuck yields to structure.

When the season changes, you can rotate which hobby or goal gets the growth focus.\\n\\nGive each area a floor and a ceiling so you stop all-or-nothing swings. For example: study floor = 60\u201390 focused minutes on weekdays, ceiling = 3 hours if energy is great; workouts floor = 3\xd730 minutes a week; piano floor = 10 minutes daily; cleaning floor = 15-minute reset nightly plus a 60-minute weekly reset; groceries/meal prep = one 90-minute block; family/social = two evenings; entertainment = one movie night. Hit the floors consistently; treat anything above as a bonus.\\n\\nBuild a weekly template, not a heroic daily to-do list. Example: deep work or study right after breakfast when energy is highest; workouts right after work on Mon/Wed/Fri so there\u2019s no decision; piano immediately after dinner; nightly 15-minute tidy; Saturday morning groceries + meal prep; Sunday weekly clean + plan the week.

Cook double and eat leftovers, use a standard grocery list or delivery, clean as you cook, listen to audiobooks or podcasts during chores, and keep your environment set up so the next action is obvious.\\n\\nFinally, accept tradeoffs. You can do everything you want across a year, but not all at once. The win is steady, boring progress: small floors hit almost every day and a simple template that protects the big rocks.

Do one lesson a day and build a tiny project each week (e.g., a simple project plan in Sheets, a dashboard of fake company data). Libraries often give free access to LinkedIn Learning; Coursera has financial aid.\\n\\nUpdate your resume with numbers: \u201cManaged calendar for 3 execs, scheduled 60+ meetings/week, cut vendor response time by 30%, maintained database of 1,200 records with 99% accuracy.\u201d Search those target titles and mirror the keywords.

Switching companies is usually the fastest raise, but also ask for more responsibility once you\u2019ve built some skills.\\n\\nFor friends, set a micro-goal in dance: say hello to one person each class and ask one small question (\u201cHow long have you been taking this class?\u201d). After a couple classes: \u201cI\u2019m grabbing water after\u2014is it cool if I join you?\u201d Low pressure, repeated often. If you can, add one more recurring group thing in the next month (another class, volunteer shift, book club). Reps matter.\\n\\nDo a 20-minute weekly review every Sunday.

By day 60, complete the certificate or second Excel course, build two tiny portfolio pieces, do 4 informational chats, apply to 60 roles total.

I\'ll not get too much into it but I\'m miserable during the weekdays. I\'m also in a new job so I\'m constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here\'s what my week looks like - \\n\\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it\'s time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \\n\\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \\n\\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I\'ve been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\\n\\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","comments":{"best_comment":"I personally don\'t think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that\'s the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn\'t have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\\n\\nI can\'t speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","percentile_10_comment":"You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).","comment_o3":"Been there during the peak of lockdown \u2013 weekdays felt like an airport lounge where I was just killing time until the flight to Friday. A few changes pulled me out of that loop.\\n\\nFirst, put a fence around work. WFH blurs the edges, so you have to draw them yourself. Decide a hard shut\u2011down time (say 7\xa0pm), put it in your calendar, tell your manager you\u2019ll be offline after that unless there\u2019s an emergency, then actually close the laptop and put it in a drawer. Most bosses won\u2019t push back if you\u2019re delivering; the boundary forces you to work with more intention and keeps the evenings clear for life.\\n\\nSecond, treat each weekday like a mini\u2011weekend by scheduling one small \u201canchor\u201d you genuinely look forward to. Could be a 30\u2011minute guitar lesson on Monday night, a pick\u2011up basketball game on Tuesday, a fancy coffee and a book on Wednesday morning, whatever. When there\u2019s something positive waiting at 6\xa0pm, the day stops feeling like an endurance test.\\n\\nThird, give your body a reason to get out of bed. Set the alarm for the same time every day, get vertical immediately (phone across the room helps), splash water on your face and step outside for 2 minutes of sunlight or a daylight lamp. Follow it with 5\u201310 push\u2011ups, squats, or stretching. Tiny, but it signals to your brain that the day has started and it\u2019s no longer sleep time.\\n\\nFourth, clean up the coping loop with food by changing the environment, not your willpower. Keep trigger snacks out of the house, prep easy high\u2011protein meals on Sunday so Weekday\u2011You doesn\u2019t have to think, and put fruit or nuts where the chips used to be. If the only \u201clazy\u201d option is something decent, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll eat.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t try to make peace with a 40\u2011year sentence. Think in 3\u2011month experiments. \u201cFor the next quarter I\u2019ll hold a 7\xa0pm work curfew, lift on M/W/F, and practice Spanish T/Th for 20 minutes.\u201d Review, tweak, repeat. Careers, companies, and you will all change many times before retirement. Your job is to build routines and skills that travel with you.\\n\\nWeekends will still be fun, they just won\u2019t be the only time you feel alive. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt5":"You don\u2019t have to accept 40 years of this. Treat the next 2\u20134 weeks as an experiment to change the structure that\u2019s making weekdays feel like a hostage situation.\\n\\nFirst, put a hard boundary on work. Pick a daily shutdown time and protect it with a calendar block. Do a brief shutdown ritual: write tomorrow\u2019s top 3 tasks, close work apps, physically close the laptop and leave the work area. If you\u2019re worried about underperforming, book a 1:1 and ask, \u201cIf I finish only one thing this week, what should it be?\u201d Then guard one 60\u201390 minute morning block for that work before you touch email/Slack. Keep a simple \u201cdone\u201d list so you can see progress.\\n\\nSecond, deliberately seed your weekdays with small things you enjoy so you\u2019re not starving for Saturday. Put a 30-minute hobby, a walk outside, or a show with a friend on the calendar Mon\u2013Thu. Move a couple of chores to weeknights so your weekend isn\u2019t all recovery + errands. Kill the Sunday dread by planning Monday on Friday afternoon or Sunday morning: write your MITs, prep notes, and choose the exact task you\u2019ll start with.\\n\\nThird, fix the \u201cstaying in bed\u201d loop. Pick one wake time and make \u201cfeet on floor within two minutes\u201d a rule. Put the alarm across the room, leave water and shoes by the bed, open blinds, and step outside for light within 10 minutes. No phone in bed. Aim for about 8\u20138.5 hours in bed; if you\u2019re awake, get up. Energy will follow the routine, not the other way around.\\n\\nFor food, add structure and a pause. Plan three meals plus one snack with protein and fiber. When the urge to cope-eat hits, set a 10-minute timer, drink water, stand up and walk around; if you still want it afterward, eat a portion on a plate at the table. Keep trigger foods out of reach or pre-portion them. You\u2019re not banning comfort food\u2014just inserting a decision point.\\n\\nMake it concrete: for the next two weeks, choose a daily hard stop (say 6:30), a morning deep-work block before lunch, a 20-minute walk outside every day, and one micro-joy each weekday. Do a 20-minute weekly review on Friday. Track it on a sticky note and aim for 80% consistency. If, after setting boundaries and aligning priorities, the culture still expects 12-hour days, that\u2019s a signal to start looking elsewhere\u2014you don\u2019t owe your next decades to a broken setup.\\n\\nRespect each day by giving it one clear win: move your body, move one important task, do one thing you enjoy. Stack two weeks of that and the weekend stops being the only time you feel alive.

It\u2019s bad because i\u2019ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I\u2019ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it\u2019s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can\u2019t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can\u2019t do this.\\n\\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don\u2019t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\\n\\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)","comments":{"best_comment":"Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. \\n\\nOne thing I will say is that it\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It\u2019s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to be ok, and it does get better. \\n\\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can\u2019t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.","percentile_10_comment":"Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. \\n\\nI\u2019m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that\u2019s making you feel bad. But it\u2019s a good place to start when trying to get on track. \\n\\nProtect your sleep. Do that by:\\n\\n- Going to bed at the same time every night. \\n- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)\\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you\u2019re not really doing anything in that hour.)\\n\\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don\u2019t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you\u2019ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \\n\\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.","comment_o3":"What helped me stick with a similar \u201cmental\u2011health first\u201d routine was treating each habit like brushing my teeth: not negotiable, but the intensity can vary day to day. I planned a tiny, can\u2019t\u2011fail version of every task\u2014five minutes of the program, two minutes of meditation, ten push\u2011ups or a short walk, walking into the corner store to buy gum. On good days I often did more, but if my mood cratered I could still hit the minimum and keep the streak alive. That one change killed the all\u2011or\u2011nothing thinking that used to send me spiraling.\\n\\nI put every task in my calendar with alarms and labelled them \u201cappointments.\u201d The less deciding I do in the moment, the less my brain can negotiate. Habit\u2011tracking apps like Loop (Android) or Streaks (iOS) give you a satisfying visual chain; I check mine off immediately afterward so the reward is instant. If you like gamification, Habitica turns your tasks into an RPG and has guilds for social anxiety where people cheer each other on.\\n\\nAccountability multiplies discipline, so I post my daily checklist in a small Discord with two friends. If I don\u2019t report by 10\xa0p.m. they ping me. You can get a similar effect from r/90daygoal or the daily threads here.\\n\\nFinally, expect the occasional miss. One slip isn\u2019t a relapse; it\u2019s a data point. When it happens I write down what tripped me up, adjust tomorrow\u2019s plan, and move on. Consistency beats perfection, and the fact that you\u2019ve already stuck with the program for a month shows you have the chops to do this. Good luck\u2014you start again every morning, and that\u2019s a powerful advantage.","comment_gpt5":"First off, nice work sticking with the program for a month. Exposures are no joke. The trick now is to make \u201cshowing up\u201d so small and automatic that even on rough days you still get a win.\\n\\nUse floors and ceilings. Set a tiny floor for each item so you never have a zero day: therapy program = open it and do 5 minutes, meditation = 1 minute, workout = 5 minutes or one set, social = step into a store and say one sentence (ask a simple question or greet a cashier). On good days, go past the floor; on bad days, just hit the floor and call it a win. Track \u201cdid the floor\u201d as success.\\n\\nTime it, don\u2019t just list it. Same sequence every day so there\u2019s less decision-making: after breakfast open the therapy module; right after that put on shoes and go do the social rep; meditate before your shower; do the workout in a fixed 15\u201320 min block. Habit stacking keeps it simple.\\n\\nPre-decide your moves. Write if-then scripts and put them where you see them. \u201cIf I catch myself scrolling in bed, I stand up, put the phone in another room, do 60 seconds of breathing, and start the therapy module.\u201d \u201cIf I feel the urge to skip the social thing, I will walk to the nearest store and ask where X is.\u201d Treat it like a fire drill, not a debate.\\n\\nBuild a ladder for the social piece. List 10 rungs from easiest to hardest and repeat each rung until it\u2019s boring before you move up. Coordinate with your program so it fits the therapy plan.\\n\\nAssume a miss and script recovery now. \u201cIf I miss a day, the next morning I do the floor of all four, text my accountability buddy \u2018reset done,\u2019 and mark an R on the calendar.\u201d Give yourself two streak freezes per month so your brain doesn\u2019t catastrophize one off day.\\n\\nMake friction for the phone and rewards for the hard stuff. Charge your phone outside the bedroom, use Screen Time/Forest to cap apps, and pair the social rep with a small reward (favorite tea, playlist, 10 min of a show) right after.\\n\\nApps/communities that actually help: Loop Habit Tracker or Streaks for simple checkmarks, Habitica if you like gamified tasks, Beeminder if money-on-the-line helps, and Focusmate for body-doubling your therapy module/workout. Daily check-in threads here or texting a friend a quick \u2705 pic keeps you honest.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need perfect days\u2014you need reliable ones. Keep the floor tiny, the timing consistent, and the recovery automatic. Do that for a few weeks and you\u2019ll have momentum that makes slipping much less likely.

Pick one direction that feels promising\u2014physical sciences, for example, since that was the last time you remember genuine interest\u2014and give it a six\u2011month sprint. During that time build a simple, repeatable routine: spend an hour a day on foundational study, an hour on a hands\u2011on side project (could be a small electronics kit, a data\u2011analysis notebook, a short explanatory video), and finish each session by writing two sentences about what felt energizing and what felt draining.

Pair that with some Stoic or CBT\u2011style reflection: ask yourself, \u201cIs this feeling helpful? Is it telling me to act, or is it just noise?\u201d Over time you\u2019ll get quicker at spotting unhelpful loops and steering back to what you can control.\\n\\nBecause a breakup can leave a huge gap in your social and purpose \u201cbuckets,\u201d deliberately fill them. See friends in person, join a hobby group, volunteer, take a course\u2014anything that reminds you you\u2019re part of something bigger than your own head. Momentum is your friend here; the more small wins you stack, the easier the next one feels.\\n\\nTrack progress somewhere visible\u2014a calendar you don\u2019t want to break, a notes app, whatever. The point isn\u2019t perfection; it\u2019s proving to yourself day after day that you keep promises to yourself. That\u2019s where real confidence comes from, not from never feeling sad again.\\n\\nIf the grief still feels overwhelming after a couple of months of genuine effort, there\u2019s zero shame in talking to a therapist. Think of it as hiring a personal trainer for your head.\\n\\nFinally, remember that discipline isn\u2019t about becoming a stoic robot. It\u2019s about having enough control that you can choose when to be open and when to be reserved. You\u2019re already on that path by asking for help. Keep showing up for yourself and the strength\u2014mental and physical\u2014will follow.","comment_gpt5":"Breakups can scramble your routines and your head. The way out is through structure, not trying to become emotionless. \u201cControl\u201d isn\u2019t not feeling things; it\u2019s feeling them and still doing what you said you\u2019d do.\\n\\nStart with a simple 30\u2011day rebuild. Pick a wake time you can keep 7 days a week and protect 8 hours in bed. Move your body every day: a 30\u2011minute walk daily and 3 strength sessions a week. If you\u2019re new, do pushups/rows/squats/planks at home or run a beginner plan like StrongLifts 5x5. Eat three real meals with protein, drink water, and cut alcohol for the month. This stabilizes energy and mood so the mental work is even possible.\\n\\nAdd a 10\u2011minute daily \u201cmind control\u201d drill. Sit, breathe in for 4, out for 6, and watch thoughts come and go without acting on them.

That gap is the muscle you\u2019re trying to build. A short journal at night helps too: one page answering, \u201cWhat did I do today my future self will thank me for? What\u2019s the plan tomorrow?\u201d Keep it under 5 minutes.\\n\\nSet rules so you don\u2019t rely on willpower. No contact and no checking her socials for 60 days. Phone sleeps outside the bedroom. Workouts happen M/W/F after work, non\u2011negotiable. If a rule gets broken, reset immediately and make it harder to happen again (block, unfollow, app limits).\\n\\nTrack it on paper. Make a tiny grid with sleep, walk, workout, meditate, journal, no\u2011contact. Cross off each day. Your goal isn\u2019t perfection; it\u2019s showing up more days than not. On Sundays, review your week in 10 minutes, adjust what\u2019s too ambitious, and plan the next one.\\n\\nIf you want resources, Atomic Habits for systems, The Obstacle Is the Way or The Daily Stoic for perspective, and a free meditation app like Insight Timer to guide the 10 minutes. If therapy is available, it\u2019s basically coaching for exactly these skills.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to become a different person to be reliable. You need reps. Give yourself 30 days of this and you will feel steadier. Tonight: set tomorrow\u2019s wake time, lay out your clothes, schedule your workout, and put your phone in another room before bed.

I\u2019m 24 y/o and never went through high school.\\n\\nI grew up in a Christian homeschooled household and to make a very long story short, since middle school my parents never kept me accountable with my school work. I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off. That coupled with my parents never checking up on how I was doing/if I was completing my schoolwork, my education just slipped through the cracks. I started working and moved out when I was 17. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been till now. I honestly don\u2019t remember what grade I got to in school before I dropped out, I\u2019m assuming 6th or 7th. \\n\\nNow that I\u2019m nearing my mid twenties I\u2019m realizing I\u2019d like to go to college in spring of 2024 but I have no idea where to even start. I was hoping I could get some advice on first steps. \\n\\nI know I need to get GED but where do I go for that? Is there a program for people like me? Am I too far gone? Please help.","comments":{"best_comment":"Hit up your local community college and tell an entrance counselor you need to take some assessment tests due to non-traditional schooling.  I guarantee you they\u2019ve heard this story before and they will help you figure out what remedial courses are necessary.  Also ask how to get assessed for learning disabilities so you can get accommodations as necessary.","percentile_10_comment":"Yo homie I also didn\'t get past 7th grade, I got my GED at 30, then started college 2 years after that. I\'m an engineer now. It\'s possible for you as well, learn about passing the GED as an exam instead of trying to learn what\'s on it (the big books the give you are intimidating), being in college is rewarding as you are around people motivated to learn. Community college will be a better resource at first until you are ready to transfer to a university.","comment_o3":"You\u2019re not too far gone at all\u201424 is a perfectly normal age to be figuring this out and people ten, twenty, even thirty years older than you do it every year. The short version of the process is: get the GED, use it to enroll in community college, then transfer or continue from there.  \\n\\nFirst step: make an account on GED.com. That site is run by the company that administers the test, and it walks you through registration, state\u2011specific rules, testing centers, fees, and free practice questions. Take the diagnostic quizzes right away; they\u2019ll show where you\u2019re strong and where you need work, which keeps your study time focused instead of random.  \\n\\nNext, call or email the nearest community college\u2019s \u201cadult education\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d department. Almost every state funds free or very low\u2011cost GED prep classes\u2014many meet at night or online and include tutors. If you suspect a learning disability, tell them; the GED has official accommodations (extra time, private room, etc.) and colleges often have disability services that can help you document and receive them.  \\n\\nNow the discipline piece: treat studying like a shift at work. Pick a specific block of time you can defend\u2014say 7\u20139\xa0p.m. on weeknights\u2014and sit in the same spot with your phone on airplane mode until the block is over. Start each session by writing the single topic you\u2019ll cover (e.g., \u201cfractions\u201d or \u201csocial studies practice test\u201d) at the top of a sheet of paper and end by jotting what to tackle tomorrow, so you never waste time wondering what\u2019s next. Khan Academy, GED Flash, and plenty of YouTube channels cover everything for free; the key is consistency, not perfect resources. Aim for four or five study blocks a week and track them on a calendar so you can see the streak grow.  \\n\\nOnce your GED practice scores are comfortably above passing, schedule the real exams one at a time. Passing all four subjects instantly makes you eligible for federal financial aid; fill out the FAFSA as soon as it opens in October and apply to the community college for Spring 2024 admission. They\u2019ll likely give you a placement test and, if needed, remedial math or English courses\u2014which is normal and nothing to be embarrassed about.  \\n\\nThe plan is straightforward: GED account tonight, call the adult\u2011ed office tomorrow, study on a fixed schedule, knock out the four exams, file FAFSA, enroll. Keep your daily study habit small but non\u2011negotiable, and the months between now and spring will be more than enough. You\u2019ve already done the hardest part by deciding to act; now it\u2019s just reps. You got this.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not too far gone. Plenty of adults get a GED in their 20s and go on to college. The path is clear, you just need a simple plan and consistent reps.\\n\\nStart at ged.com and make a free account. It shows your state\u2019s rules, test centers, costs, and lets you take the official GED Ready practice tests. Some states use HiSET instead (hiset.org). Also call your local community college or public library and ask for \u201cAdult Basic Education\u201d or \u201cGED prep\u201d\u2014they often have free classes, tutors, and sometimes test-fee vouchers.\\n\\nTake a diagnostic (GED Ready) for each subject to see where you\u2019re at. Then pick an exam date 8\u201312 weeks out for your first subject and build backward. Many people do one subject at a time to build momentum. Study 60\u201390 minutes a day, 5\u20136 days a week. Resources that work: Khan Academy for math and science reading/data, GED.com\u2019s own prep, and a GED prep book from the library (McGraw-Hill or Steck-Vaughn). Focus first on Reasoning Through Language Arts and Math; Social Studies and Science are largely reading, charts, and basic reasoning.\\n\\nIf you suspect a learning disability, ask your community college\u2019s disability services how to get evaluated and how to request GED testing accommodations (extra time, breaks, etc.). GED Testing Service has an accommodations portal\u2014you\u2019ll need documentation, so start that soon.\\n\\nFor college, community colleges are built for this transition. Apply now, meet an advisor, and ask about placement tests and whether you can start with a class while finishing your GED. Fill out the FAFSA at studentaid.gov for financial aid; ask the college\u2019s financial aid office about deadlines and state grants. If spring is tight, aim for the next term\u2014the key is steady progress now.\\n\\nDiscipline basics that help: set a daily study block tied to a trigger (e.g., right after breakfast), use Pomodoro (25 minutes on, 5 off), and set a \u201cminimum\u201d on tough days (20 minutes still counts). Study in the same spot, phone out of reach, and keep a simple habit tracker or calendar X for each day you show up. Do a 15-minute weekly review every Sunday to plan which lessons you\u2019ll cover and when you\u2019ll take the next practice test. Get accountability\u2014a tutor, a friend, or even a weekly check-in post.\\n\\nLogistics: you\u2019ll need valid ID for testing. You can take the four GED subjects separately, and many states offer discounted retakes. After you pass one, schedule the next while the momentum is high.\\n\\nYou\u2019ve already done the hardest part by deciding to change. Start with the GED account and a practice test this week, pick your first test date, and make tomorrow your first 60-minute study session. In a few months, you can have a GED in hand and be enrolling in classes. One session at a time.

So, all the best.","comment_o3":"Start with the basics: consistent 7\u20118 hour sleep, real meals with protein and complex carbs, plenty of water, and a bit of movement every day. The moment those slip, no amount of coffee keeps you alert, and caffeine tolerance rises fast.

Skim the notes or textbook before class and write down a handful of questions you actually want answered. In lecture, focus on listening for the answers instead of copying every line; afterward, try to explain the proof to a friend or a rubber duck. Teaching forces active engagement and cuts study time later.\\n\\nKeep study blocks short enough that willpower doesn\u2019t flatline. The classic Pomodoro (25\u2011on, 5\u2011off, four rounds then a longer break) works because you\u2019re never more than a few minutes from standing up.

Stop transcribing proofs. Before class, skim for 10 minutes and write down 2\u20133 questions. During lecture, capture the main claim, the key lemmas, and where you\u2019re confused. After, spend 20\u201330 minutes doing practice problems or re\u2011deriving steps without notes. Teach the gist to an imaginary student or a friend. If the professor isn\u2019t engaging, supplement or replace with a clearer source (textbook sections, a good YouTube playlist) and use lecture only for attendance/announcements.\\n\\nFix your environment and body cues. Bright light in the morning, cool room, upright posture. Stand or walk during breaks. A set \u201cstudy spot\u201d only for work, and keep Netflix off that device.

My work timings are usually 10-6 but it\u2019s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it\u2019s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don\u2019t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it\u2019s cheap in India) but I don\u2019t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it\u2019s another hassle to manage. \\nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\\nIs it too much to ask ? Please help.\\nAlso, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.","comments":{"best_comment":"Cook in Batches like for 2/3 days. It saves a good chunck of time and you can use it for purposes. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.","percentile_10_comment":"Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it","comment_o3":"I\u2019m in the same boat with a full\u2011time job and no outside help, and the only way I\u2019ve made it work is by turning everything into a system instead of a daily decision. Pick one grocery day and one bulk\u2011cooking block per week\u2014Saturday morning, Sunday evening, whatever\u2014and treat them like non\u2011negotiable appointments. On grocery day you buy for a fixed menu of 3\u20114 simple dishes that all share ingredients (for example: chana masala, stir\u2011fried veggies, and lemon rice use overlapping onions, tomatoes, peppers, and spices). On cooking day you batch\u2011cook double or triple portions, portion them into individual containers, and stack them in the fridge/freezer. Reheating when you get home takes five minutes, so dinner and tomorrow\u2019s lunch are sorted and the mental chatter about what to eat disappears.\\n\\nA cheap pressure cooker or Instant Pot pays for itself in time: throw soaked lentils + veggies + spices in the morning, set delay timer, and it\u2019s ready when you walk through the door. One\u2011pot dishes also mean almost no dishes\u2014lid, pot, spoon, done. For the rest of the kitchen mess, wash as you cook; you\u2019re standing there watching something simmer anyway.\\n\\nHousework is the same \u201csmall daily, bigger weekly\u201d system. Set a 10\u2011minute timer every night for a quick reset of the living room and dishes, and a 30\u2011minute timer on Sunday for sweeping, mopping, and bathroom wipe\u2011down. That\u2019s under two hours total per week, far less than the mental load of wondering when you\u2019ll clean. If you ever fall behind, hire a maid for a one\u2011off deep clean, then go back to your maintenance routine.\\n\\nFor workouts, don\u2019t chase a perfect 90\u2011minute gym session. A 20\u2011minute bodyweight circuit or yoga flow right after waking will move your energy up a notch. Lay out clothes and a mat the night before so 8\xa0a.m. you roll out of bed and start, no thinking required. Once that habit sticks you can decide whether getting up earlier is worth the extra training time.\\n\\nThe common thread is front\u2011loading decisions. Decide once a week what you\u2019ll eat, when groceries happen, when cooking happens, when cleaning happens, and when you exercise. Put those blocks on your calendar the same way you\u2019d schedule meetings, then run the script. It feels rigid at first, but the payoff is all the free headspace after work to actually relax instead of juggling chores.","comment_gpt5":"It\u2019s not too much to ask. You\u2019re trying to do three things at once (work, home, health), so the trick is to remove decisions and compress tasks. Try this 2-week experiment and then adjust.\\n\\nFirst, set defaults. Pick two breakfasts and three dinners you\u2019ll repeat. Example: breakfast = poha or oats+curd+fruit. Dinners rotate between khichdi, dal-chawal with a sabzi, and egg/paneer bhurji with rotis. Decide once, repeat, no daily brainstorming. Make a master grocery list for these meals and set a recurring weekly order on BigBasket/Blinkit/Zepto. Keep pantry staples always stocked: onions, tomatoes, garlic-ginger paste, canned/soaked beans, rice, atta, eggs, frozen veggies, curd, paneer.\\n\\nBatch the heavy lifting twice a week. Sunday and Wednesday after work or Sunday morning, spend 60\u201390 minutes prepping. Use a pressure cooker with separators to cook dal, rice, and a steamed veg in one go. Make a big onion-tomato masala base and freeze in small portions. Boil 6\u20138 eggs. Soak and pressure cook chana/rajma for the week; freeze portions. Knead atta for 2\u20133 days, or buy ready phulkas/frozen rotis. When you get home at 7:30, dinner becomes assembly: reheat rice, add masala to a pan, toss in pre-cooked dal/veg/paneer, and you\u2019re eating in 15\u201320 minutes. Cook dinner with one extra portion for next day\u2019s lunch and pack it before bed.\\n\\nStreamline cleanup. Cook mostly one-pot. Use one good kadhai and the pressure cooker; avoid a mountain of utensils. Clean as you go, then run a 10-minute \u201creset\u201d timer before bed: wipe counters, soak anything sticky, start the next day\u2019s soak/soak beans if needed. If dishes are your biggest pain, consider a tiny outsource: either get a maid just for jhaadu-pocha-bartan for 30\u201340 minutes a day or book an Urban Company weekly deep clean. You can keep it strictly task-based to reduce hassle. Another hybrid: use a tiffin service for lunch on workdays and only cook dinner; you\u2019ll still save money and brain space versus ordering out daily.\\n\\nMorning routine doesn\u2019t have to be \u201csuper early.\u201d Aim for 20 minutes. Lay out workout clothes at night. Do a simple at-home circuit right after you brush: squats, push-ups (incline on a table if needed), rows with a backpack, and a plank. Set a 20-minute timer and stop when it rings. Breakfast is one of your defaults, ready in 5\u201310 minutes. Move wake time earlier by 15 minutes each week, not all at once, and set a bedtime alarm to start winding down. Screens off 30 minutes before sleep helps a lot.\\n\\nProtect focus at work by planning food once weekly. Keep your rotation in a Google Keep note and your grocery cart pre-saved. If you want variety, swap one dinner per week; otherwise keep it boring and automatic. On a tough day, allow a \u201cfallback\u201d meal: eggs + toast + salad/cucumber, or curd rice with pickle. That\u2019s still healthy and fast.\\n\\nA sample cadence: Sunday prep; Mon cook for Mon/Tue; Tue leftovers; Wed prep and cook for Wed/Thu; Thu leftovers; Fri super-quick meal or tiffin; Sat flexible. Track how long things actually take for a week\u2014most people overestimate. The goal isn\u2019t gourmet; it\u2019s repeatable. Systems > willpower. After two weeks, keep what worked and drop what didn\u2019t.

Consistency beats intensity, and tiny, locked\u2011in habits give you a foundation you can always rebuild on.","comment_gpt5":"Swinging from \u201call-in\u201d to \u201cnothing\u201d usually means the bar was set too high. The fix isn\u2019t to summon more willpower, it\u2019s to build a smaller on-ramp and stack easy wins.\\n\\nUse guitar as your keystone. Set a tiny daily floor and a reasonable ceiling: floor = 5 minutes, ceiling = 25 minutes. Same cue and time every day, e.g., right after dinner. Keep the guitar on a stand, pick and tuner visible, chair ready, phone on Do Not Disturb. When the cue hits, start a timer immediately\u2014no negotiating.\\n\\nGive each session a simple structure so you never wonder what to do: 2 minutes warm-up (chromatic or finger exercises), 5\u201310 minutes on one focused skill (e.g., clean F chord, G\u2013C changes, alternate picking), 5\u201310 minutes on a song section you enjoy, last minute recording a quick clip. End while it still feels doable. Progress comes from frequency more than duration.\\n\\nTrack and make it visual. Print a month calendar and X every practice day. Rule is \u201cnever miss twice.\u201d If you\u2019re tired, hit the 5-minute floor and call it a win. If you feel good, go to the ceiling, not beyond; leave some fuel in the tank so tomorrow isn\u2019t harder. Do a weekly 30-second recording to hear progress\u2014huge for motivation.\\n\\nAdd one general habit to support discipline, not five. Easiest is a 10-minute walk right after your practice, or 10 push-ups before you sit down with the guitar. It links \u201cI show up\u201d across domains and rebuilds the identity of someone who does small things consistently.\\n\\nExpect low-motivation days. Treat feelings as weather and the routine as your umbrella. Start the timer, touch strings for two minutes, and momentum will usually carry you. If it doesn\u2019t, you still protected the streak.\\n\\nAfter two weeks, bump the floor to 10 minutes and keep the ceiling. After a month, pick one measurable guitar goal, like clean F chord five times in a row at 60 bpm or nailing the intro to a specific song. Clear \u201cdone\u201d criteria make sessions feel purposeful.\\n\\nResources if you want structure: JustinGuitar\u2019s beginner course or a simple YouTube playlist you repeat until bored. Fewer choices = less friction.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to get back to \u201cextreme.\u201d Get back to \u201calways.\u201d Five minutes daily beats two hours sporadically, and it\u2019s the fastest path to feeling disciplined again."}},{"id":"t3_12k7iil","title":"[Need Advice]I cant even get myself to work 3 hours a day consistently.","body":"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work.

Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you\u2019re having a bad day and ask yourself \u201cwhat the f am I doing this?\u201d Your brain replies with the answer and continue.","comment_o3":"Three hours of \u201cpure work\u201d sounds small on paper, but it\u2019s a marathon if you\u2019re not used to sustained focus. Most people who claim they can crank out six deep\u2011work hours got there by building up in small blocks, not by flipping a switch. Instead of lowering the daily goal, try reframing it: commit to one focused 25\u2011minute sprint, then decide whether to do another. Stack those sprints until you hit three hours or until you call it for the day. If you only manage two sprints, you still practiced the skill and logged exactly how long you lasted, so you have real data to beat tomorrow.\\n\\nMake the sessions easier to start. The night before, write down the single most specific task you\u2019ll attack first\u2014e.g., \u201cWrite introduction paragraph,\u201d not \u201cWork on website.\u201d When you sit down, there\u2019s zero decision fatigue; you just press play. Pair that with a short pre\u2011work ritual (brew coffee, put phone in another room, open only the files you need). Linking the ritual to the first sprint cues your brain that \u201cthis is work time,\u201d the same way tying your shoes cues your brain it\u2019s gym time.\\n\\nThe lack of immediate payoff is normal for knowledge work, so manufacture one. Keep a visible log of completed tasks or minutes\u2014crossing them off provides the quick dopamine hit you get from a pump in the gym. Schedule a small, guilt\u2011free reward after your last sprint: a walk, a game, whatever. The brain starts associating the end of a work session with something pleasant, making the next session easier to initiate.\\n\\nAs for not caring about \u201cmaking bank,\u201d focus on the reason this business exists for you besides money. Is it learning a skill, earning freedom, solving a problem you find interesting? If you can\u2019t identify a why that resonates, you may be forcing yourself toward a goal you don\u2019t value, and no productivity hack will fix that. Either uncover a motivating purpose or pivot to work that does matter to you.\\n\\nFinally, expect fluctuation. Professional writers, developers, and academics have off days too; they just show up anyway and protect the habit. Treat each session as practice, not a performance. If you string together weeks of consistent 25\u2011minute blocks, you\u2019ll look back and realize you\u2019re already doing the three\u2011hour days you thought were impossible.","comment_gpt5":"3 hours of pure focus isn\u2019t \u201csmall.\u201d For most people, true deep work caps at 3\u20134 hours on a good day.

Floor = one focused block you can hit even on bad days (start with 25\u201350 minutes). Ceiling = 3 hours. Protect the floor to build the streak; hit the ceiling only when you have gas. After a week or two, bump the floor by 10\u201315 minutes.\\n\\nMake the blocks boringly structured. Same time each day, ideally first thing. Two-minute setup: define the next concrete action (not \u201cwork on business,\u201d but \u201cdraft 3 outreach emails\u201d or \u201coutline section 2\u201d). Start a timer (25/5 or 50/10).

Example: after coffee at 7:30, sit at the same desk, put on the same playlist, start a 25\u2011minute timer, and do the smallest possible first action (open the doc and write one ugly sentence; open the textbook and do problem 1; put on shoes and step out the door).

Aim for a true 7\u20138 hours of sleep in one block; for most people that means lights out around 10:30\xa0pm if you\u2019re logging back on at 9\xa0am. Give yourself a 30\u2011minute wind\u2011down without screens so you\u2019re actually asleep when you think you are. When you wake up, get bright light and a glass of water immediately. Hold off on the first coffee for 60\u201390\xa0minutes; that lets your natural cortisol wake you up first and keeps the crash away.\\n\\nThe 11\xa0am slump is often blood sugar. Keep breakfast protein\u2011heavy and go easy on simple carbs at lunch. Think chicken/veg, not a big bowl of pasta. Right after eating, walk around the block or do a quick set of push\u2011ups; a couple of minutes of movement blunts the post\u2011meal crash better than more caffeine.\\n\\nUse the fact you\u2019re WFH: stand for calls, stretch every hour, open the curtains. Tiny movement breaks keep circulation up and stop the \u201coffice\u2011chair coma.\u201d If you\u2019re still nodding off, schedule a 15\u2011minute power nap before 2\xa0pm\u2014set an alarm, lie down, eyes closed. It\u2019s surprisingly effective and won\u2019t wreck nighttime sleep.\\n\\nOn study time, pick one primary slot and protect it.

Weekends become your longer, deeper study blocks so weekdays only need maintenance sessions.\\n\\nFinally, audit your work hours. Many remote gigs sprawl because we let them. Decide on a finish time, tell coworkers you\u2019ll reply next day, and log off.

The fix is less \u201ctry harder\u201d and more \u201cengineer your day.\u201d\\n\\nFirst, nail sleep basics for 2\u20133 weeks: same wake/bed time every day, shoot for 7.5\u20138.5 hours, dark/cool room, no screens the last 60 minutes, and cut caffeine 8\u201310 hours before bed (for most people that\u2019s no later than ~2 p.m.). Get outside light within an hour of waking for 5\u201310 minutes; it does more than coffee for alertness.\\n\\nSecond, manage the dips on purpose. Late\u2011morning and after\u2011lunch slumps: short movement every hour (60\u201390 seconds of squats/pushups or a brisk walk to the mailbox), and a 10\u201315 minute walk right after lunch. Keep lunch lighter with protein/veg/fat and fewer refined carbs to avoid the crash. If you\u2019re still dragging, a 15\u201320 minute power nap between 12:30\u20132:30 can be gold. A \u201ccoffee nap\u201d (drink coffee, nap 15 min) can carry you through the afternoon without wrecking night sleep.\\n\\nThird, match tasks to energy. Do your most cognitively heavy work when you\u2019re naturally sharper (usually early morning). Push meetings/admin to your 11 a.m. dip if you can. Work in cycles like 50/10 or 90/20 and actually stand up on the breaks.\\n\\nFor studies, stop trying to squeeze it into the sleepiest part of your day. Pick one high\u2011quality block when you\u2019re alert: either 60\u201390 minutes before 9 a.m. or a focused 30\u201345 minutes right after work following a brisk walk. Decide the exact task the night before (\u201cChapter 3, problems 1\u20136\u201d or \u201cwatch lecture 2, take 1 page of notes\u201d) and set a minimum baseline so you win even on tired days (e.g., 20 minutes or one page). If weekdays are tight, do one longer anchor block on the weekend to reduce weekday pressure.\\n\\nMake the environment do some work for you: bright light in the morning, cooler room, standing desk or chair that encourages posture changes, water bottle nearby, and website blockers during study blocks. Put these on your calendar like meetings; protect them.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re still unusually sleepy after consistent 7\u20139 hours and the above for a few weeks, consider medical basics (snoring/apnea, low iron/ferritin, thyroid, B12) with a doctor.\\n\\nTL;DR sample day: wake 6:45, sunlight + 10\u2011min walk, study 7:15\u20138:15, work 9\u201312, walk + light lunch, 15\u2011min nap, work 1\u20135 in cycles, admin 5\u20137, short walk, light dinner, wind\u2011down 60 min, asleep ~10:45.

Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don\'t know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \\"I didn\'t have much more to say\\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn\'t write her and she didn\'t write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it\'s something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\\n\\n**Two minors issues**\\n\\n* **First of all, I don\'t like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\\\--\x3e This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn\'t went to gym anymore for years).\\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\\\--\x3e Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \\n \\n\\n**My two biggest issues**\\n\\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\\\--\x3e For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn\'t message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it\'s really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \\"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\\" and the thought really really scares me.  \\n \\n* **Dating** \\\\--\x3e In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it\'s exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don\'t want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \\"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \\n \\n\\n**I really don\'t know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share.

When you try to twist four or five knobs simultaneously (gym, alcohol, porn, dating, school) you run out of willpower fast, relapse on one, then feel like the whole panel exploded. Pick the single habit that would make everything else easier and nail it for 60\u201190 days. For most people in your situation that\u2019s consistent exercise because it\u2019s an anchor: it floods you with endorphins, regulates sleep, gives you something to do when urges hit, and grows self\u2011respect. Your plan can be as simple as three strength workouts and two 30\u2011minute walks per week, booked on your calendar like classes you can\u2019t skip. When you\u2019re sick or busy, keep the streak alive with an ultra\u2011tiny version\u2014five minutes of push\u2011ups or stretching counts. The goal is \u201cnever zero,\u201d not \u201cperfect session.\u201d Once that\u2019s automated you\u2019ll be surprised how much easier it is to drink less, study better, and resist porn because your brain already has a daily win.\\n\\nFor alcohol, decide your rule before you enter the bar: \u201cno drinks\u201d or \u201ctwo and done.\u201d Announce it to the friend who will actually call you on it, not the one who buys rounds. Order a soda with lime as soon as you arrive so your hands aren\u2019t empty. Track nights alcohol\u2011free on a calendar; watching a streak grow scratches the same dopamine itch drinking used to.\\n\\nPorn is a stimulus\u2011response loop like any other. Remove the stimulus (blockers, phone out of bedroom, no screens after 11), replace the response (cold shower, short walk, text a friend) and expect withdrawal waves for two weeks. When you slip\u2014and you will\u2014label it data, not failure. Note the trigger, adjust the environment, start the streak counter at one again. That mental reset is the real skill you\u2019re practicing.\\n\\nDating can wait. You\u2019re about to switch countries twice; that\u2019s enough novelty. Give yourself permission to focus on friendships, study, and the habits above until you land in the exchange semester. Loneliness won\u2019t kill you; chasing new matches while you\u2019re unstable might. If someone amazing crosses your path organically, great, but deleting the apps removes the \u201cshould I swipe?\u201d bandwidth tax and lets you prove to yourself that you can be content solo.\\n\\nFinally, therapy usually feels unproductive right before the real work starts. If you can afford it, commit to another ten sessions and treat it like training, not chatting. Show up with a written agenda of what happened, what you tried, what didn\u2019t work. That alone makes it feel practical.\\n\\nTL;DR: pick exercise as your keystone habit, guard it like a class, layer in alcohol rules, treat porn slips as data, pause the dating apps, and give therapy another structured shot. Stack small, repeatable wins and the darker thoughts lose their grip. You\u2019ve got good resources; now turn them into daily reps.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019ve already started turning the ship: you cut way back on alcohol, you\u2019re in the gym, you\u2019re reflecting instead of numbing. Now give yourself a clear season to build a base. For the next 60\u201390 days, simplify and focus on a few keystone behaviors you can carry through travel and schedule changes.\\n\\nFor body/fitness, make the habit stupid-easy to keep when life gets busy. Pre-commit to a minimum program you can do anywhere: three full\u2011body sessions a week, daily walking, and a protein/veggie target. When sick or slammed, do \u201cmaintenance mode\u201d instead of skipping: a 20\u2011minute walk, a few sets of bodyweight moves, early bedtime. Use the never-miss-twice rule. If school starts, your plan doesn\u2019t change, only the time slot does\u2014put sessions in your calendar like classes.\\n\\nFor weight, pick one simple lever. Either track calories for two weeks to learn your numbers, or use rules like protein with every meal, eat mostly whole foods, and no liquid calories. Aim for slow loss; fast loss invites rebound.\\n\\nFor alcohol, set one bright-line rule for this season. Either go zero, or something like a two\u2011drink cap and no alcohol at home. Tell friends you\u2019re on a health kick so you don\u2019t negotiate with yourself in the moment. Order a non\u2011alcoholic drink first to make it automatic.\\n\\nFor porn/masturbation, stop making it a forever decision and make it a today decision. Build a system, not a streak. Change the environment (blockers on all devices, no phone in bed/bathroom, keep doors open when on a laptop), and have an if\u2011then plan: if an urge hits, then I start a 10\u2011minute timer, leave the room, do 20 pushups or a cold rinse, and text a friend or go for a walk. Track urges surfed, not just days \u201cclean.\u201d If you slip, do a quick post\u2011mortem (when/where/why), patch the hole, and resume the plan the same day. If going totally abstinent feels paralyzing, set a 30\u2011day experiment, then reassess with what you learned.\\n\\nDating-wise, with two moves coming, consider a deliberate pause. Delete the apps for 30\u201360 days and put that time into sleep, training, study, and friends. You won\u2019t miss out; you\u2019ll show up to the next chapter more stable and attractive. If you keep dating, cap it (e.g., one date a week) and timebox swiping so it doesn\u2019t eat your bandwidth.\\n\\nTherapy is a practice, not a chat. Go back and give it 8\u201312 sessions with an agenda: compulsive porn use, alcohol boundaries, relationship patterns, coping skills when lonely. If sessions feel aimless, say that and ask for CBT/ACT\u2011style tools. Bring notes from your week so you always have something to work on.\\n\\nGive your days a simple frame: consistent sleep/wake, 10 minutes each morning to plan your top three tasks, two focused study blocks, one movement session, and a 5\u2011minute evening check\u2011in where you score habits and prep tomorrow. Track compliance weekly and adjust the plan to hit 80% consistently rather than aiming for 100% and crashing.\\n\\nLast thing: if those dark thoughts ever come back, reach out\u2014to a professional, a hotline in your country, or someone you trust. Needing help is normal, especially while you\u2019re rebuilding.\\n\\nTiny wins > perfect days. Stack them and the rest follows.

I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\\n\\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don\u2019t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked.

Its deteriorating because you can\u2019t accept yourself and the lack of confidence shows.\\n\\nA sex therapist would the best place to help you.","comment_o3":"First, treat this the same way you\u2019d treat any compulsion that\u2019s hijacking your time: remove easy access, add friction, and fill the vacuum with something that actually moves your life forward. Start tonight by wiping all saved porn from your phone and laptop, unfollowing the Twitter subs, and installing a blocker like Cold Turkey or BlockSite on every device. Give a friend the password or use a random one\u2011time generator so you can\u2019t bypass it in a weak moment.\\n\\nNext, swap the bedtime cue. Right now arousal equals sleep because you\u2019ve trained your brain that way. Pick a different, non\u2011sexual wind\u2011down ritual and commit to it for thirty nights. A paper book in bed, guided breathing on YouTube, or even boring finance articles will do\u2014anything that tells your brain, \u201cIt\u2019s sleep time, not porn time.\u201d Go to bed and wake up at fixed hours, no screens in the bedroom, and caffeine only before noon. It\u2019ll be rough for a week or two, then the new cue starts sticking.\\n\\nDaytime urges hit hardest when you\u2019re idle or stressed. Keep the phone out of reach in lectures, take handwritten notes, and set 25\u2011minute focus blocks with a five\u2011minute stretch break. If the urge shows up, stand up, do ten push\u2011ups, breathe deep, and get back to work. Physical interruption breaks the loop.\\n\\nConfidence won\u2019t magically return, but it does grow with reps. Lift weights three times a week, join Toastmasters or volunteer to read the next case study aloud, and track every small win in a notebook. Seeing proof that you can shape your body and speak in public starts dismantling the \u201cI\u2019m always the girl\u201d narrative.\\n\\nIf the fantasies still dominate, find outside accountability. A kink\u2011aware therapist, SAA meetings, or the communities on r/pornfree and r/nofap are built for exactly this. You\u2019re not broken; you\u2019re caught in a reinforced habit loop, and thousands have climbed out of the same hole.\\n\\nExpect slips. When they happen, don\u2019t spiral\u2014log what triggered it, tighten your defenses, and keep the streak going. Give yourself 90 sober days and you\u2019ll be shocked at how different your brain, sleep, and self\u2011image feel. Keep grinding\u2014you\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not broken. Your brain got conditioned by a very specific stimulus loop. That can be unlearned, but it takes structure and time. Think in two tracks: 1) break the sleep/porn association, 2) rebuild daytime focus and confidence.\\n\\nFirst, sleep. Create a boring, consistent pre-bed routine that doesn\u2019t include any erotic content: 60\u201390 minutes before bed, screens off or at least no social feeds, shower, light stretch, paper book, dim lights. If you\u2019re lying in bed and your mind goes straight to sexual fantasy, get out of bed, sit in a chair, breathe slowly, read a dull book for 10\u201315 minutes, then try again. This is stimulus control: bed is only for sleep. Add basics that make sleep easier without porn: morning sunlight, exercise earlier in the day, no caffeine after noon, cool dark room, white noise, and a simple wind-down script (box breathing or body scan). Expect the first week to be rough; it gets easier as your brain stops tying sleep to porn.\\n\\nSecond, cut the supply. Make it hard to \u201caccidentally\u201d open anything. Remove Twitter/Reddit from your phone or log out and change passwords to long random strings stored in a manager you can\u2019t access on mobile. Install a blocker like Freedom or Cold Turkey with scheduled locks that cover your high-risk hours (late night, during lectures, before presentations). Use a DNS filter like CleanBrowsing Family on your devices/router. Put your phone in another room at night and during lectures. The goal is friction: when the urge hits, there\u2019s just enough delay to choose differently.\\n\\nHave an urge plan. When the urge spikes, set a 10-minute timer and surf it: breathe, notice the sensations, don\u2019t engage the story. Cravings peak and fade within minutes if you don\u2019t feed them. Pair that with a replacement routine: leave the room you\u2019re in, splash water on your face, do 20 squats or a brisk 5-minute walk, then do one tiny productive action (open slides, outline one point, or read one page). Track urges and what helped; treat lapses as data, not drama.\\n\\nRebuild study habits with constraint. For lectures, sit up front, phone off and out of sight, and take handwritten notes. For self-study, two 50\u201390 minute deep-work blocks per day are enough if protected: blockers on, only the materials you need open, a visible timer, and a simple checklist of 3\u20135 tasks. If you\u2019re watching lectures, do it in a public spot or library where you won\u2019t open other tabs. Tie internet freedom to task completion: no social apps until your blocks are done.\\n\\nConfidence for presentations comes from reps. Every day, record a 3\u20135 minute talk on any topic, review it, and tweak one thing (pace, eye contact with the camera, pauses). Before live presentations, do three out-loud run-throughs standing up. Consider Toastmasters if you can. Also, a few minutes of calm breathing and a power stance before you present helps your nervous system more than trying to \u201cthink your way\u201d into confidence.\\n\\nMindset matters. Fantasies don\u2019t define your worth or your capability. The goal isn\u2019t to police identity; it\u2019s to get out of a compulsive loop that\u2019s hijacking your time and confidence. If you choose to keep any sexual content, set deliberate boundaries (e.g., no hypno or brainwash-style content, no porn on phone, only at specific times, not before bed). Many people find a 30-day porn-free reset helpful to let arousal patterns cool off.\\n\\nIf this feels bigger than self-help, look for a therapist who is kink-aware and experienced with compulsive sexual behavior. That\u2019s not a moral judgment; it\u2019s like hiring a coach for a stubborn habit. Accountability also helps: tell one trusted friend your plan and send them a daily two-sentence check-in.\\n\\nMake it concrete for the next 7 days: no phone in bedroom, Freedom/Cold Turkey schedule on all devices, CleanBrowsing DNS, two daily deep-work blocks, nightly wind-down routine, and one short speaking practice. Track it on paper. If you slip, reset immediately and shorten the gap to your next clean day. You can absolutely recondition this.

Pick a time you can reliably protect\u201430\u201145 minutes is fine at first\u2014and sit at the same place, with the same tools, every day. Consistency rewires your brain faster than marathon sessions do. While you\u2019ve got a year, choose a free online course (Coursera, Khan, edX) that\u2019s close to what you\u2019ll face in school and move through it slowly. Watch a short lecture, close the video, and test yourself from memory before looking at your notes; active recall beats rereading for long\u2011term retention.

The technical friction you remove now is energy you\u2019ll keep for harder material later. Millions of people go back to school in mid\u2011life and crush it; the ones who stick with a simple, repeatable routine end up feeling like they never left. Start small, show up daily, review weekly, and you\u2019ll hit the first semester already warmed up.","comment_gpt5":"Congrats on the decision. Treat the next year like a training plan for a marathon: build the habits and stamina now so school feels familiar, not shocking.\\n\\nStart with consistency over intensity. For the first 4\u20136 weeks, do two 25-minute study blocks a day at the same times, five days a week. Pick one subject you\u2019ll likely need (math refreshers, writing, or a foundational course on Coursera/Khan Academy/edX). Use active recall instead of rereading: after a section or video, close everything and write what you remember, then check and correct. Make a few Anki flashcards from your own notes and review them daily. End each session by writing the next concrete action so tomorrow\u2019s start is frictionless.\\n\\nBuild your environment and cues now. Same desk, minimal clutter, timer ready, phone in another room, website blocker on. Have a simple start ritual (tea, headphones, timer) to tell your brain \u201cit\u2019s study time.\u201d Protect sleep and get two or three short workouts a week\u2014those do more for focus than any app.\\n\\nAfter a month, scale up. Move to 90\u2013120 minutes a day, five days a week, and add a weekly planning session on Sunday: list what you\u2019ll study, block it on a calendar, and set small deadlines. Every week, do at least one timed, closed-book session to mimic quizzes. If your program is math-heavy, work through a Khan Academy path daily. If it\u2019s writing-heavy, write 200\u2013300 words a day summarizing an article and one short essay a week; get feedback via a friend, tutor, or online community.\\n\\nFocus on techniques that actually move the needle: Pomodoro 25/5, retrieval practice, spaced repetition (Anki), Cornell notes, and the Feynman technique (explain a concept in plain language). Minimize highlighting and passive reading. Keep a simple tracker for study minutes and streaks; momentum matters.\\n\\nAvoid burnout by planning recovery. Stick to five study days, one light day, one full rest day. Every 6\u20138 weeks, take a deload week where you cut volume by 30\u201350% but keep the routine. Keep a wins log to see progress.\\n\\nThree steps to start this week: pick one free course that matches your future program, set two daily 25-minute blocks at fixed times, and set up Anki with 10 self-made cards a day.

I want to grow in life, but in more areas than not, I feel like I am complacent and also procrastinate on achieving my goals and dreams. \\n\\nFor this discussion, I would like some advice on how to overcome complacency and apathy in life, how do I make sure I am continually growing, and how do I continually get out of my comfort zone?","comments":{"best_comment":"I agree with you. One of the reasons I have for getting out of my comfort zone is to not waste my life being mediocre and to really have a positive impact on the world. A lot of people have a midlife crisis because they are being complacent. I have other reasons too, but this is one of them.","percentile_10_comment":"Why do you want to keep growing and get out of your comfort zone? This might seem like a strange question to ask, but different people will want this for different reasons. If you really want this then it can be extremely helpful to know why, exactly, you want it.","comment_o3":"Complacency creeps in when the next step isn\u2019t obvious or urgent, so the first move is to give your growth an address: pick one area you genuinely care about and define a clear, measurable target. \u201cRead more\u201d becomes \u201cfinish 12 non\u2011fiction books this year,\u201d \u201cget fitter\u201d becomes \u201crun 5\xa0km in under 30\xa0minutes.\u201d Specificity creates friction against drifting.\\n\\nOnce the target is concrete, forget about motivation and build a process that makes the next action automatic. Decide when, where, and for how long you\u2019ll work on it, put it on your calendar, and treat that block like an appointment you can\u2019t miss. If you can\u2019t see exactly when you\u2019ll practice, you\u2019ll default to someday\u2014which is when complacency loves to visit.\\n\\nTo push your comfort zone without burning out, use the 85\xa0% rule: most of the time stay in tasks you can do fairly well, but carve out 15\xa0% of each session for something that\u2019s just beyond your current ability. That sweet spot feels awkward enough to trigger growth but not so hard that you quit.\\n\\nTrack progress visibly\u2014whiteboard, habit app, notebook, whatever you\u2019ll actually look at. A streak counter or progress graph creates tiny hits of momentum and makes plateaus obvious before they turn into months of inertia. If the numbers stop moving, tighten the feedback loop: shorter cycles of plan\u2011do\u2011review, maybe weekly instead of monthly.\\n\\nAccountability multiplies discipline. Tell a friend, join a subreddit challenge thread, or hire a coach. The goal isn\u2019t shame; it\u2019s an external nudge that reminds you you\u2019re playing a bigger game than \u201cI\u2019ll do it when I feel like it.\u201d\\n\\nFinally, protect your identity as a learner. Each time you show up\u2014even for five sloppy minutes\u2014tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who trains daily.\u201d Identity\u2011based framing lasts longer than adrenaline spikes of motivation. Keep accumulating those tiny votes for the growth\u2011oriented version of you, and complacency loses its grip.","comment_gpt5":"Complacency usually wins when goals are vague and days don\u2019t have a clear \u201cnext action.\u201d Give yourself a simple system that forces small wins and regular discomfort, then let the compounding happen.\\n\\nPick 2 areas to grow for the next 12 weeks. For each, choose one input you control, not an outcome. Example: career skill \u2192 ship one artifact per week (tiny blog post, GitHub commit, slide deck). Fitness \u2192 train 3 days/week for 30 minutes. Creativity \u2192 practice 20 minutes daily and publish once a week. Keep the floors tiny so you can\u2019t talk yourself out of them.\\n\\nSchedule a daily \u201cdiscomfort rep.\u201d It should be a 6/10 on the discomfort scale\u2014noticeably outside your comfort zone but not panic-inducing. Examples: DM one person for feedback, ask a question in a meeting, do the first cold shower minute, apply to one opportunity. Do it first or second thing in your work block. Your comfort zone expands through reps, not epiphanies.\\n\\nBeat procrastination with start rituals and environment. Decide the exact when/where for each input: \u201cAt 7:30 pm at my desk, I open VS Code and work 10 minutes on the project.\u201d Use a 5\u201310 minute timer to start. Lay out gear the night before. Block the biggest distraction on your work device for your first 60\u201390 minutes. Default to single-tab, full-screen. Make the start frictionless and the distractions annoying to access.\\n\\nAdd stakes and accountability. Book a class, sign up for a low-stakes presentation in 4 weeks, schedule a check-in with a friend every Friday, or use a commitment contract. When something is on the calendar and someone expects it, complacency has to fight uphill.\\n\\nRun a weekly review. Every Sunday, update a simple scoreboard: how many inputs hit, what shipped, one thing to improve, one thing to drop. If you hit the floor easily for two weeks, raise it slightly. If you miss, don\u2019t compensate with a huge catch-up\u2014just re-establish your floor the very next day. Never miss twice is the rule.\\n\\nTemplate you can start this week:\\n1) Choose two areas: say fitness and career skill.\\n2) Floors: 30-minute workouts Mon/Wed/Fri. Ship one small artifact by Sunday.\\n3) Daily discomfort rep at 9 am: send one outreach or ask one question.\\n4) Work block ritual: 10-minute timer, one-tab rule, phone in another room.\\n5) Sunday 20-minute review and plan the next week\u2019s exact times.\\n\\nIf you keep the floors easy, the starts automatic, and the discomfort rep daily, you\u2019ll stay out of stasis without burning out.

Go to your school\u2019s advising or registrar office tomorrow, in person, and ask about a late withdrawal or leave of absence for last semester. Schools usually have a process that lets you wipe F\u2019s off the transcript if you can document a medical/mental\u2011health issue; at worst they can tell you the deadline and your exact GPA situation so you know what you\u2019re dealing with. While you\u2019re there, ask what would happen to your scholarship if you sit out a semester\u2014get facts before making the decision. That information will make the conversation with your dad and the scholarship provider a lot easier, because you can present a plan instead of just a confession: \u201cI had a rough first semester, I\u2019ve spoken with the school, I\u2019m taking a leave/retaking the classes, here\u2019s the timeline and what I\u2019m doing to fix it.\u201d\\n\\nSecond, treat the porn loop like any other compulsive behavior: remove frictionless access and add frictionless alternatives. Put your gaming PC/console in a common area or box it up and leave it at a friend\u2019s for a month. Install blocking software that only a friend has the password to. Use your phone or a library computer for schoolwork so you can\u2019t alter the blocker. When the urge hits, stand up, leave the room, and do ten push\u2011ups, walk outside, or open your textbook\u2014teach your brain that the cue leads somewhere else. If you relapse, no moral drama; log it and reset the counter.\\n\\nThird, shrink your study sessions to something you cannot refuse. Literally set a timer for five minutes, open the syllabus, and start. When five minutes are up you can quit\u2014most of the time you\u2019ll keep going. Pair that with a hard daily cutoff: once it\u2019s 6\xa0p.m. you\u2019re done for the day, no guilt, which prevents the \u201cI wasted the morning so the day is ruined\u201d spiral.\\n\\nFourth, get humans involved.

Tell one friend what you\u2019re trying to fix and text them a photo of your study space each time you start a session\u2014accountability doesn\u2019t have to be deep, it just has to exist.\\n\\nTaking a semester off can work if you treat it like rehab, not vacation: structured schedule, part\u2011time job for routine, counseling, daily exercise, and clocked study blocks to retake or prep classes. Gather the facts from your school first, then decide. Whatever you choose, move on it this week\u2014the sooner you act, the smaller the mess gets.

If you don\u2019t yet have the systems to work, a planned leave is smarter than repeating the same cycle and nuking your GPA and aid.

You need friction you can\u2019t bypass. Move your computer out of your bedroom or work only in the library. Remove your admin rights and have someone else hold the admin password. Set your router/phone DNS to a filtered service and have a parent hold the credentials. Consider a dumbphone or a locked-down Chromebook. Uninstall games and lock Steam/console with a PIN someone else controls. Keep your door open or work in public so it\u2019s awkward to slip.\\n\\nYour \u201cI get up and wander\u201d is a conditioning issue, not a character flaw. You\u2019ve trained your brain that your room+computer = entertainment. Change the context. Study at the library or a quiet caf\xe9 with a decent chair. Use a super-low friction start: sit down, open the doc, write one ugly sentence. Do 25 minutes on, 5 off. If you truly can\u2019t focus, do \u201cbody doubling\u201d (Focusmate, Discord study rooms, or a study buddy) so someone is virtually sitting with you.\\n\\nFor urges, run a 10-minute rule: when the urge hits, set a timer for 10, stand up, drink water, do 20 squats, step outside for 2 minutes of fresh air. Most urges crest and fall if you don\u2019t feed them immediately. Track streaks if you like, but prioritize rebuilding your environment the same day after any slip. One slip isn\u2019t a spiral unless you let it be.\\n\\nUse help that already exists. Most colleges offer free counseling\u2014book it and specifically ask for support with compulsive sexual behavior and anxiety. If you take a leave, still do counseling and join a local or online support group. The point isn\u2019t to talk forever; it\u2019s to get external accountability and tools.\\n\\nConcrete next steps: send the two emails to advisor/aid today, text your dad to talk tonight and bring your plan, remove your admin rights and hand off the password, uninstall games and lock accounts, and go work at the library tomorrow at a set time for just 30 minutes. Win the next 48 hours. Momentum first, mastery later. You\u2019ve dug a hole, yes\u2014but the ladder is very buildable if you start with these boring but powerful moves."}},{"id":"t3_p89z6k","title":"[Need Advice] Why do I find myself going on social media overdrive after a long hard day of work?","body":"After completing 16 solid hours of productive analytical work, instead of hitting the sack, I go into manic scrolling mode..

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day\'s productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.","percentile_10_comment":"I\u2019m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary \u2018A Social Dilemma\u2019. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it\u2019s akin to slot machines. \\n\\nHere\u2019s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\\n\\n\\n\u201cEach time you\u2019re swiping down, it\u2019s like a slot machine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. Sometimes it\u2019s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it\u2019s just an ad.\u201d What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\\n\\nThis feeds into the \u2018pull to refresh\u2019 function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline\u2014whether that\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email\u2014we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising \u2018likes\u2019 or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what\u2019s called \u2018ludic loops\u2019\u2014where a user is unsure whether they\u2019ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation\u2014is what keeps us hooked.

Sixteen hours of heavy thinking drains the part of your brain that says \u201cgo to bed,\u201d so the autopilot seeks an easy dopamine drip. Fight it with structure, not willpower. Pick a hard stop for work, then schedule a short decompress window you actually look forward to\u2014maybe 30\u201145 minutes of music, a walk, or light reading. When that window ends, the phone goes on a charger in another room, social apps are blocked by something like Cold Turkey, and the bedroom stays screen\u2011free. Make the shutdown ritual as automatic as brushing your teeth: shower, dim lights, stretch, fiction book, sleep. If you still need novelty during the day, insert micro\u2011breaks\u2014five minutes outside, quick chat, cup of tea\u2014so you\u2019re not starved for stimulation by night. A tired brain can\u2019t win a fight against infinite scroll, but it never has to if the phone is out of reach and the evening is pre\u2011decided.","comment_gpt5":"What you\u2019re describing is a mix of \u201crevenge bedtime procrastination\u201d and leftover arousal from a long, analytical day. After 16 hours of self-control, your brain craves easy novelty and autonomy. Add bright light and infinite scroll, and you\u2019re basically hitting the gas on your nervous system right when you need to brake.\\n\\nTwo levers: a deliberate shutdown ritual and hard constraints on the phone. Pick a fixed \u201cscreens-off\u201d time and set a bedtime alarm like you would for a meeting. At that alarm, do a 5\u201310 minute shutdown: jot tomorrow\u2019s top 3, capture any loose ends, say \u201cshutdown complete,\u201d then put your phone to charge outside the bedroom. Use an alarm clock so you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d the phone. If you can\u2019t resist, make it impossible: iOS Downtime/Android Bedtime with passcode held by a partner, Freedom/Opal/One Sec, or a cheap lockbox for the late hours. Turning off Wi\u2011Fi on a timer works surprisingly well too.\\n\\nGive your brain a clear off-ramp. Replace doomscrolling with low-stimulation decompression that still feels good: warm shower, light stretch, breathing for 3 minutes, tea, then paper fiction under dim warm light. The goal isn\u2019t \u201cproductive leisure,\u201d it\u2019s \u201ccalm, repeatable cues that tell your body it\u2019s safe to sleep.\u201d Keep lights low and screens amber if you must use them; bright blue light will keep you wired. If you want a \u201ctreat,\u201d bundle it with the routine, e.g., only read a favorite novel in bed after the phone is parked.\\n\\nMake the behavior change brain-dead simple. Pre-decide: \u201cWhen it\u2019s 10:30, I plug the phone in the kitchen, turn off Wi\u2011Fi, write tomorrow\u2019s plan, shower, read, lights out.\u201d If you lapse, don\u2019t bargain; still get up at your usual time the next day to rebuild sleep pressure for the following night.\\n\\nAlso look upstream. Sixteen-hour days make binges more likely. If you can\u2019t shorten the day, at least end \u201cdeep work\u201d 60\u201390 minutes before bed so the shutdown routine isn\u2019t fighting a running engine. Watch caffeine after midday, and consider deleting the most aggressive apps from your phone and allowing them only on desktop at limited windows.\\n\\nYou\u2019ve already got solid ideas in your update. Pick one or two keystone changes (phone out of bedroom + shutdown ritual) and nail them for two weeks. Consistency beats intensity here, and once the cue\u2013routine is automatic, the urge to scroll drops a lot."}},{"id":"t3_zs03uo","title":"[Need Advice] I still live with my mom at 26.

You\u2019re doing great. Just keep doing your best at whatever you set your mind to and maintain a growth mindset. You are already enough. Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma. Keep displaying the courage it takes to be vulnerable, like you did by sharing your story, and it will inspire those around you to do the same. Remember, you don\u2019t need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm!","percentile_10_comment":"I would get a job in construction. It\'s full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.\\n\\nYou can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.\\n\\nShe sounds toxic by telling you that you can\'t function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you\'re interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it\'s one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it\'s harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\\n\\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.","comment_o3":"First, stop beating yourself up. Twenty\u2011six with a part\u2011time job and one class is not a life sentence; it\u2019s just your current snapshot. What you need most right now is a clear one\u2011year plan that gets you to a livable income and a realistic exit date, while keeping school moving in the background instead of letting it run the show.\\n\\nIncome comes first because rent and groceries can\u2019t be deferred. Treat \u201cget to 35\u201340 hours a week\u201d as Priority A. Apply daily, follow up every 48\xa0hrs, and cast a wide net: retail, call centers, warehouse, temp agencies, hospitality, gig work\u2014anything that starts paying quickly. Use Cleveland\u2019s cost of living to your advantage; plenty of people your age share a house for $600\u2013700 a month. If your current employer can\u2019t give you hours, keep them only if the schedule flexibility helps school; otherwise swap them for a place that will.\\n\\nOnce you hit full\u2011time hours, track every dollar for a month. You\u2019ll see where $100\u2013200 leaks out that could become an emergency fund. Aim to save one month of projected rent before you move; that\u2019s usually enough to keep surprises from sending you back home.\\n\\nKeep school but keep it cheap. Fill out FAFSA, talk to the community college\u2019s financial\u2011aid office, and see whether you qualify for the Pell Grant\u2014many students in your income range get tuition covered and some money back for books. Take only courses that march you toward a credential employers actually ask for (nursing prerequisites, IT cert classes, accounting, etc.). Evening or online sections let you hold a job without stretching yourself to the breaking point. One or two classes a term is fine; the degree doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t pay the bills.\\n\\nAbout the $500 storage \u201crent\u201d: that\u2019s a drain. Offer your mom something concrete\u2014spend two weekends photographing, listing, and selling the items, then split the money and shut the unit down. If she refuses, explain that you\u2019ll have to redirect part of that $500 to your moving fund. You\u2019re not dodging responsibility; you\u2019re reallocating it so you can stand on your own.\\n\\nDaily discipline can be as simple as a three\u2011line checklist: job hunt tasks, school study block, exercise/house chores. Hit those three and the day is a win. Review progress every Sunday night, adjust, and repeat. Momentum compounds.\\n\\nIndependence before degree isn\u2019t an either/or; it\u2019s degree on low simmer while income and savings boil. Give yourself twelve months of focused effort, track the numbers, and you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly the \u201cincapable\u201d label disappears. You\u2019re not behind\u2014you\u2019re just at the starting line and finally facing the right direction. Now sprint.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not broken, you just need a clear, ruthless plan and a few habits you can stick to. Independence is mostly about steady income + predictable routines. A degree can help long-term, but the fastest lever right now is full-time work and taking over your own bills.\\n\\nMake income the priority for the next 90 days. Treat the job hunt like a job: set a daily block (e.g., 9\u201312) where you send tailored applications, follow up on ones you sent 48\u201372 hours ago, and call or walk in to places that are hiring. Aim for volume and speed over perfection. In Cleveland, look hard at hospital systems (Cleveland Clinic, UH, MetroHealth) for support roles like environmental services, dietary, patient transport, call center\u2014these are often full-time with benefits and tuition help. Also check UPS/FedEx/USPS, warehouses, state/county/city job boards, security, grocery and retail chains, and temp agencies. Ask your current job to cross-train you for more hours while you search. Your goal is a full-time paycheck first; then you can be choosy.\\n\\nAbout school: unless this one class is a must-have prereq for a near-term higher-paying role or you have tuition help, it\u2019s reasonable to pause next term until you lock a full-time job. Another path is to keep exactly one class but only if it doesn\u2019t slow the job hunt. Once employed, use employer tuition benefits or a short cert that boosts pay fast (Tri-C has STNA/CNA, phlebotomy, medical billing, CDL, and entry IT like A+ or Google IT Support). Don\u2019t let school be an indefinite delay\u2014make it serve the independence goal.\\n\\nClean up the money. Write a bare-bones budget you\u2019d live on if you moved out with roommates. Build a move-out fund with a first milestone of $1,000 cash buffer, then 2\u20133 months of basic expenses. Automate transfers the day you\u2019re paid. The $500 you\u2019re putting toward the storage space isn\u2019t buying you independence\u2014make it a project to shut that cost down. Set a 60-day deadline to liquidate: spend 60\u201390 minutes most days inventorying and listing items on Facebook Marketplace/OfferUp, batch buyers to weekends, donate or trash what doesn\u2019t move, and close the unit. That one change could fund groceries, your phone plan, or savings.\\n\\nBuild a simple daily routine you can keep even when life is messy: fixed wake time, job search block, class/skill block, 30\u201345 minutes of housework and no more, a quick workout or walk, and a lights-out time. Do a weekly review every Sunday: how many applications, callbacks, interviews, dollars saved, and storage items listed/sold. Track it on paper; what gets measured gets done.\\n\\nStart taking over bills in stages. Move your phone to your name and buy your own groceries. It proves capability to both of you, and it forces the budgeting muscle to grow. As you take on bills, reduce what you hand your mom for nonessential expenses so you\u2019re not spinning in place.\\n\\nHave a calm conversation with your mom with concrete milestones: \u201cI\u2019m applying to X jobs per week, plan to be full-time by [date], will take over phone and groceries by [date], storage unit closed by [date], target move-out by [date]\u2014likely with roommates first.\u201d Keep it about actions and dates, not arguments about capability.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not stupid to work a \u201cshitty\u201d job if it\u2019s a stepping stone. The win is stable income + reps living like an adult. Once that\u2019s in place, stack skills or a degree on top with tuition help. Give yourself 12 weeks of militant consistency and you\u2019ll feel like a different person, not because your worth changed, but because your days did. Focus on the next tangible action today: send five applications, follow up on two, list three items, cook one cheap meal, and be in bed on time.

I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","comments":{"best_comment":"PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS\\n\\nHonestly though you\u2019re probably better off than you think if you see the problems.

But it is also an emotional and social outlet. Not everyone needs to cut it entirely but I agree with the sentiment. Can be harmful and overused, like social media or the internet in general","comment_o3":"First off, the 100\u2011pound loss is a huge win; don\u2019t brush it aside. It shows you can stick with something hard and get results, which is exactly the muscle you need for everything else. Think of the next year as a \u201cNew Game+\u201d run where you keep that willpower stat and start adding new skills.\\n\\nPick one life area to push forward for the next 30 days and ignore everything else that\u2019s nagging you. Most people in your spot get overwhelmed because they try to rebuild career, finances, social life, hobbies, and mental health all at once. The fastest route is sequential, not simultaneous. Because money touches everything, I\u2019d start there: download a budget app, log the last three months of spending, and give every dollar a job. Even if the numbers look ugly, seeing them in one place turns an invisible enemy into a visible one you can fight.\\n\\nLock in a daily rhythm that is dead simple, repeatable, and front\u2011loads the important stuff before your willpower leaks away. Wake up, drink water, make your bed, ten\u2011minute walk outside, five\u2011minute journal on paper, then the day can go any direction. Those tiny anchors keep your brain from spinning off first thing and build the \u201cI keep promises to myself\u201d identity. If you still game, park the console/PC in a closet or uninstall weekday access. Removing friction beats relying on willpower over and over.\\n\\nOn the career side, forget The One Perfect Passion. Pick any skill that pays reasonably well and has a clear learning path\u2014coding bootcamp, HVAC apprenticeship, forklift cert, whatever sounds least awful\u2014and treat it like grinding XP. Two focused hours of study or practice five days a week will outpace most people in six months. If analysis\u2011paralysis hits, flip a coin and commit; motion beats mental churn.\\n\\nYou mentioned alcohol and weed; those make depression worse and memory fuzzier. Try a 30\u2011day zero\u2011tolerance experiment. Tell yourself it\u2019s data collection, not a life sentence. Track mood, energy, and sleep. Most people feel noticeably sharper by week three, which makes every other habit easier.\\n\\nSocially, aim for one real\u2011life interaction per week that isn\u2019t family or coworkers: a pickup basketball game, volunteer shift, library class, whatever. Face\u2011to\u2011face time pulls you out of your head and reminds you the world is bigger than your thoughts. You do not need instant deep friendships; you just need reps.\\n\\nFinally, therapist or support group is a force multiplier. You\u2019re untangling family baggage, addiction, and self\u2011talk\u2014there\u2019s no prize for soloing that dungeon.\\n\\nIf you stay consistent with a budget, a morning micro\u2011routine, a single marketable skill, and thirty days sober, you\u2019ll be stunned how different life feels by your 30th birthday. Small, boring wins stacked daily beat the huge, flashy overhaul you keep waiting to start. You already proved you can do hard things; now make them the right hard things. Good luck, man\u2014see you on the leaderboard.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not as far behind as you think. Plenty of people hit reset at 30 and build solid lives. You\u2019ve already proven you can do hard things by dropping ~100 lbs. Let\u2019s channel that into a simple, boring, repeatable system that doesn\u2019t rely on motivation.\\n\\nStart with a minimum viable day. Pick a consistent sleep and wake time and protect it like a job. In the morning, hydrate, eat a real breakfast, get 10 minutes of sunlight and a brisk walk, and sit for 10 minutes of quiet breathing or a basic meditation app. Block one focused work session (25\u201350 minutes) on something that moves your life forward, then later in the day do 30\u201360 minutes of exercise and 15 minutes of cleaning or finances. Define \u201cdone for the day\u201d as hitting those basics; if they\u2019re done, you\u2019re allowed to relax without guilt. This gives you structure and a clear finish line.\\n\\nOn gaming, alcohol, and weed: try a 90\u2011day reset. Uninstall games, stash the console/PC, and use site blockers on YouTube/scroll traps. For alcohol/weed, commit to a clean streak, tell one supportive person, and check in daily on communities like r/stopdrinking and r/leaves or try SMART Recovery/AA meetings. Fill the time vacuum on purpose: gym classes, a nightly walk, library time, or a hobby that uses your hands. If you reintroduce later, do it with rules (e.g., only scheduled social gaming 1x/week, no solo drinking, no weekday use). Also, fuel your body consistently. Extreme fasting plus alcohol will wreck energy and focus; aim for protein at each meal, plenty of water, and regular meals.\\n\\nFor focus, presence, and memory, externalize your brain. Keep a simple capture system: a pocket notebook or one notes app. Each evening, do a 10\u2011minute brain dump, then write Tomorrow\u2019s Top 3 tasks. In the morning, read them before touching your phone. During the week, use a timer and do work in short, timed sprints with your phone in another room. Do a 30\u2011minute weekly review every Sunday: scan your notes, pick next week\u2019s Top 3, and schedule them. If a perspective \u201cclicks,\u201d write it down in a \u201cRules for Future Me\u201d note and reread it each morning for a week. That\u2019s how you build recall\u2014by revisiting the ideas.\\n\\nFor being present and a better listener, keep it mechanical. Before conversations, take one slow breath and feel your feet on the floor. While the other person talks, keep your eyes on their face and aim to paraphrase one sentence back (\u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026?\u201d). Ask two follow\u2011up questions before you talk about yourself. When your mind wanders, notice it and return to their last sentence. It\u2019s a rep, not a failure. Ten minutes of daily meditation will make this easier within a few weeks.\\n\\nOn career, don\u2019t wait for passion. Action creates interest. Pick a \u201cgood\u2011enough\u201d path you can start within weeks, not years, and test it with a 30\u2011 to 60\u2011day sprint. Examples that work for a lot of people: IT help desk via Google IT Support/CompTIA A+; trades like electrician/HVAC/plumbing apprenticeships; CDL; basic bookkeeping; entry customer success roles. Spend one hour a day on tangible outputs: finish a module, apply to two jobs, or book an informational call. Book one informational interview per week with someone in the role you\u2019re exploring; ask how they broke in, what the day looks like, and what beginner mistakes to avoid.\\n\\nTighten finances with automation. List your fixed bills, set up auto\u2011pay on a separate \u201cbills\u201d account, and move a fixed \u201cspending money\u201d amount weekly to your main debit account. Track spending once a week for 15 minutes. Get any job that pays today if needed, then upgrade; income now beats \u201cperfect later.\u201d\\n\\nReplace online social time with real\u2011world reps. Join one recurring thing that meets weekly: a rec sports league, BJJ/boxing, Toastmasters, a community class, or volunteering. Put it on the calendar and show up even when you don\u2019t feel like it. Real people and real stakes will retrain your brain away from virtual wins.\\n\\nBecause you mentioned depression and harsh self\u2011judgment, consider adding a pro to your team. Therapy, a primary care checkup, or a group like SMART/AA can accelerate everything. If money\u2019s tight, look for sliding\u2011scale clinics or community mental health.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a simple 90\u2011day challenge that covers all bases: consistent sleep and wake time; 10 minutes of meditation; one focused work block on career or job applications; one workout or long walk; 15 minutes of cleaning/finances; no gaming/alcohol/weed for 90 days; one in\u2011person social activity per week; weekly Sunday review to set your Top 3. Track it with a paper calendar and mark an X each day. Aim for \u201cnever miss twice.\u201d\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to fix your whole life at once. You need one solid day, repeated. Stack those days and your brain, body, and opportunities will catch up fast. You\u2019ve already proved you can change. Now make it boring and consistent.

I\'d legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I\'ve done just that before.\\n\\nI realize it will ultimately come to \\"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\\" which is fine. But ideally I\'d like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","comments":{"best_comment":"Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\\n\\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\\n\\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you\u2019re more than capable, and just start again.\\n\\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.","percentile_10_comment":"I realised recently my messy room was a coping mechanism.

Example: at 7:00 pm, set a 5\u2011minute timer, put your phone on the charger in another room, and pick up just 10 items. That\u2019s the whole plan. If you want to stop at 5 minutes, stop.

If you snore, wake up gasping, or feel dead tired no matter what, ask a doctor about sleep apnea\u2014tons of \u201coverweight, always tired, ADHD that meds don\u2019t fix\u201d folks discover that\u2019s the real culprit.\\n\\nNext, create a 30\u2011minute morning \u201claunch sequence.\u201d Water, quick stretch, meds, review today\u2019s three priorities, 10\u2011minute apartment tidy. That little clean\u2011up stops the shame spiral and gives you a daily victory before work.\\n\\nFor ADHD productivity, treat tasks like reps at the gym: short, counted, and timed. Use a 25/5 Pomodoro timer and aim for just two of those before lunch. Put your phone in another room, open only what you need, and start with something that takes five minutes to finish so your brain gets the dopamine hit. Momentum matters more than ambition right now.\\n\\nThe law degree feels huge because it\u2019s undefined. Break the remaining six months into weekly deliverables (e.g., \u201cRead and outline Chapter 3 cases by Friday\u201d). Track them on a wall calendar you can physically mark. When you hit four weeks of green X\u2019s, reward yourself with something guilt\u2011free.\\n\\nAbout work: spend the first 15 minutes of every day writing the ONE thing that will get you fired if you ignore it. Do that first. Email your boss a short \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m on today\u201d note; light accountability works wonders, and they\u2019ll likely appreciate the visibility.\\n\\nFinances: open a spreadsheet tonight, list every debt, minimum payment, and interest rate\u2014ugly truth on one page. Tomorrow call each collector and set up an autopay plan. Once a payment schedule exists, the mental noise drops dramatically.\\n\\nThe apartment: set a timer for 10 minutes after work and fill one trash bag. Stop when the timer rings. Repeat daily. Small doses bypass the overwhelm and, inside a month, the place will look completely different.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t try to \u201cfeel motivated.\u201d Act first, mood follows. Keep the commitments tiny, track them visibly, and stack small wins. Six months of steady, boring reps will rescue the degree, calm the job situation, clear the room, and shrink the debt. You\u2019ll still be you\u2014just a version that finishes things. Good luck, man.","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re closer to a turnaround than it feels. Think triage, not total overhaul. Pick a few levers that create outsized results and run them for 6\u201312 weeks.\\n\\nFirst, make a call on the law degree. Either finish intentionally or quit intentionally\u2014no more limbo. If finishing aligns with your goals, lower the bar to \u201cminimum viable pass.\u201d Break the 6 months into weekly targets and schedule two short study sprints on weekdays and one on Saturday. Use body-doubling (Focusmate, library study rooms, \u201cstudy with me\u201d streams). Your only rule: open the materials and work for 10 minutes. Activation beats motivation. If you still hate it after 10, you can stop. Most days you\u2019ll keep going.\\n\\nFix sleep like it\u2019s a job. Pick a consistent wake time and protect it for 30 days, even after bad nights. Get outside within 15 minutes of waking for 10\u201315 minutes of daylight, move your body a bit, cut caffeine after noon, set a wind-down alarm 60\u201390 minutes before bed, and keep your phone out of the bedroom. Given the lifelong fatigue, delayed sleep, and unrefreshing mornings, talk to your doctor about a sleep study and basic labs (thyroid, iron, B12, vitamin D, etc.). If your sleep is circadian-delayed, ask about timing strategies/treatments. Medication helps ADHD more when sleep is handled.\\n\\nAt work, build tiny daily structure and external accountability. Each morning, write your top one task that actually moves the needle and do a 25-minute sprint on it before anything reactive. Break deliverables into steps you can finish in 30\u201360 minutes and time-box them on your calendar. Send your manager a short status note or post in the team chat: here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing today, here\u2019s what\u2019s next, here\u2019s any blocker. It lowers anxiety and keeps you ahead of deadlines.\\n\\nFor energy and weight, don\u2019t try to out-discipline biology. Keep it simple: add two 10-minute walks a day (after meals is great) and prioritize protein at the first meal. If weight won\u2019t budge despite \u201ceating healthy,\u201d collect data for two weeks with a food log and a kitchen scale\u2014not forever, just to calibrate. Track weight trend (not single days). Sleep and walking often move the needle more than heroic gym plans at first.\\n\\nTame the apartment with a daily 10-minute reset. Set a timer after dinner, put trash in a bag, dishes in the sink/dishwasher, clothes in a hamper, and clear one surface. That\u2019s it. Pick one \u201calways clean\u201d zone (desk or kitchen counter) and protect it daily. Keep supplies where you use them, and use body-doubling for a weekly 30\u201360 minute deeper clean. Momentum here spills into everything else.\\n\\nFor finances, stop the bleeding and make it boring. Gather balances, minimums, and due dates. Set up autopay for minimums so nothing slips. Call collectors and get on a payment plan\u2014one uncomfortable hour now saves months of stress. Use a simple zero-based budget (YNAB, Monarch, or a spreadsheet) and schedule a recurring 30-minute \u201cMoney Monday\u201d to pay bills, reconcile, and plan the next week. Freeze discretionary cards if you need to.\\n\\nSocial stuff: go in with a tiny script. Before meetings, write one point you\u2019ll make and one question you\u2019ll ask. Say something in the first five minutes to break the ice in your brain. After each meeting, jot a one-line debrief. Reps matter more than confidence.\\n\\nMake the system visible so you don\u2019t rely on memory. Night before: lay out clothes, put your study materials on the desk, and write tomorrow\u2019s top work task on a sticky note. Morning: light, walk, one 25-minute study sprint, shower, then work top task. Afternoon: walk. Evening: 10-minute tidy. Once a week: Money Monday and a 30-minute weekly review to map your top three outcomes for work and uni and time-box them on your calendar.\\n\\nTwo meta-tips. Make quitting a decision, not a drift: if you\u2019re going to stop something, pick a date, review, then choose. And use supports that fit ADHD: body-doubling, timers, blockers (Cold Turkey/Focus), and accommodations at uni/work if available. ADHD coaching or skills-based CBT can also be a force multiplier.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to become a different person\u2014just stack a few small, repeatable behaviors and let them compound. Give this a clean 6\u201312 week run and reassess. Motivation will lag; action first, feelings follow."}},{"id":"t3_ow4ft3","title":"[need advice] I don\u2019t know what to do after I get out of bed","body":"I can get out of bed sure but I don\u2019t have anything to do I\u2019m on summer vacation I\u2019m 15, but I have barely any responsibilities all I do is workout, do a few quick chores and off I\u2019m scrolling on YouTube I listen to music as a hobby but i want more hobbies I just get up late because I don\u2019t have much to do help","comments":{"best_comment":"Maybe try to add a couple hobbies to spend 30-60min every day on?

Two weeks is long enough to see if it clicks but short enough that you won\u2019t feel trapped.  \\n\\nScrolling happens because it\u2019s the easiest option, so make it slightly harder.

Since you like music, options could be learning an instrument or basic music production, but you can also try beginner coding (free Python courses), drawing (follow a 30-day fundamentals playlist), a language (Duolingo + one grammar video), cooking (one new recipe per week), or something tactile like solving a Rubik\u2019s cube or juggling. Set concrete mini-goals: learn 3 chords and play one song, finish the first 5 modules of a course, draw 30 heads in 30 days, cook 10 meals.

We\'re talking beyond attitude and effort and willpower. It\'s cost me every job and hobby I\'ve ever had and it\'s cost me the love of my life. \\n\\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I\'ve been a game developer for a decade and I\'ve never finished a game.

I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on \u2014 as you seem to well know. \\n\\nI set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \\n\\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I\u2019m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\\n\\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early.

I\u2019d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn\u2019t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn\u2019t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \\n\\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly. Accomplishing these small goals will build confidence, which inspires motivation, which is how you build discipline. That\u2019s how I overcame the problem you\u2019re having.","percentile_10_comment":"The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won\'t last. If hope is your motivator, it will. \\n\\nA big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks.

Just have to restart a few times, and that\'s ok.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve dealt with something similar and a few things finally moved the needle for me. First, stop framing it as \u201cI need more discipline.\u201d The word is loaded in your head, so swap it for \u201cexperiments.\u201d Pick a ridiculously small, 5\u2011minute experiment you can do every day for two weeks. For a game dev that might be opening the project and fixing one line or writing one sentence of a design doc, then you\u2019re allowed to quit. For music it could be playing one scale on a single string. It feels stupidly small, but that\u2019s the point: you\u2019re proving to your brain that showing up doesn\u2019t equal pain.\\n\\nSecond, separate outcome from identity. Instead of \u201cI never finish games so I\u2019m undisciplined,\u201d try \u201cI haven\u2019t found a system that lets me finish yet.\u201d Keep a physical notebook and each day write the date and what your 5\u2011minute experiment was. That growing list is concrete evidence that you can follow through, even if the tasks are tiny.\\n\\nThird, outsource structure until it\u2019s boring. Join a coworking Discord with daily check\u2011ins, hire a cheap accountability coach on Focusmate, or book a practice session with a teacher who expects a scale every lesson. External eyes lower the bar to starting because someone else is holding the frame.\\n\\nFourth, treat therapy like a skills coach, not a deep dive into childhood unless you want that. A CBT or schema therapist can help you neutralize the \u201cdiscipline = threat\u201d association with evidence\u2011gathering and exposure exercises, the same way people unlearn phobias.\\n\\nFinally, give yourself a single finish line this year: one tiny, shippable game jam entry, one recorded cover that uses sheet music, whatever. Everything you do funnels toward that one finish, no side quests. When the urge to abandon pops up, remind yourself the whole goal is simply to finish something small once, not to make it perfect.\\n\\nIt\u2019s unglamorous, but stacking laughably easy reps, using outside scaffolding, and aiming for one concrete finish is how I turned the lifelong wall into a speed bump. You can, too. Good luck.","comment_gpt5":"Yes, people do get past this.

The start is a 3-minute ritual that never changes: sit down, open the tool, set a 3-minute timer. The finish is an objectively done outcome you can produce in minutes. For games: one mechanic toy, one level, hit build, upload a GIF or prototype somewhere. For music: record a 20\u201330s clip of one scale/arpeggio or a clean passage once. You are allowed to stop immediately after the finish. The win is \u201cI started and I finished,\u201d not \u201cI worked hard.\u201d\\n\\nTime-box everything. When the wall shows up, shrink the box. Three minutes \u2192 one minute \u2192 one line of code or one scale once. If you still can\u2019t start, change location/posture, restart the 3-minute timer, and aim for the tiniest finish. Treat the wall as a cue to make the task dumber and smaller, not a verdict on you.\\n\\nScope ruthlessly so you ship. For the next two weeks, make toys and prototypes only: one mechanic, one level, no menu, no polish, daily upload. For music, tether technique to fun: between songs, do a single scale once, then back to the song. That\u2019s exposure without rebellion.\\n\\nExternalize discipline so it\u2019s not you vs you. Body doubling (Focusmate, Discord coworking, friend on call), daily check-ins with one person, weekly game jam or open mic. Short deadlines + witnesses beat internal pep talks.\\n\\nTrack the bare minimum: a notebook with two checkboxes per day\u2014start done? finish shipped? yes/no.

The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\\n\\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \\"unhealthy\\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\\n\\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating.

Treat the issue (could be anything, you gotta figure it out on your own), not the symptom (overeating).","comment_o3":"A few things that helped me shrink my intake without feeling miserable. First, make the decision at the grocery store, not in the kitchen. If the only snacks in the house are things you don\u2019t mind eating in bigger quantities\u2014baby carrots, pickles, air\u2011popped popcorn\u2014it\u2019s hard to blow up your calories no matter how bored you feel. Leftovers are trickier, but you can pre\u2011portion them into single\u2011serve containers and freeze anything beyond tomorrow\u2019s meals. The extra step of thawing adds just enough friction to let the craving pass.\\n\\nSecond, schedule your eating the same way you\u2019d schedule workouts. Pick a simple rule like \u201cI eat at 10, 2 and 7\u201d or an 8\u2011hour eating window. Outside those times, the kitchen is closed. If you\u2019re genuinely hungry, drink a full glass of water, wait fifteen minutes, then reassess; half the time the urge disappears because it was thirst or boredom masquerading as hunger.\\n\\nThird, give your brain an automatic alternative for boredom. Make a two\u2011minute move rule: whenever you catch yourself wandering toward the fridge, you have to do something active for two minutes first\u2014push\u2011ups, a walk around the block, tidying a drawer. After the two minutes you can still eat if you want, but the pause breaks the habit loop and often fulfills the need for stimulation that was driving you there in the first place.\\n\\nFinally, track what you do, not just what you hope to do. Log everything in an app like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal, even the handful of chips. Seeing the numbers stack up in real time builds awareness and makes the gap between 2500 and 1700 obvious and actionable. If you miss your target, don\u2019t spiral; look at the log, find the 300\u2011calorie item that pushed you over, and plan one concrete change for tomorrow. String a few of those days together and the new intake level becomes the default rather than a constant fight.","comment_gpt5":"Boredom eating is a habit loop, so make the loop harder to start and easier to replace.\\n\\nFirst, fix the environment. Pack leftovers into single portions immediately after cooking, label them \u201ctomorrow\u2019s lunch,\u201d and stick most in the freezer. Put tempting stuff out of sight (foil or opaque containers), healthy stuff front-and-center. No eating from the pot or the package, and use a plate at a table with no screens.\\n\\nSet a default \u201ccraving script.\u201d Example: if you want to eat outside your planned meal/snack, do 3 things first\u2014big glass of water, mint tea or gum, and set a 20\u2011minute timer. Urges peak and fade. If you still want something after the timer, have a pre-decided 150\u2013200 kcal snack (Greek yogurt, apple + peanut butter, carrots + hummus, air\u2011popped popcorn) and stop there.\\n\\nPre\u2011plan your day. Log meals the night before or morning of. Include a small daily treat so you don\u2019t feel deprived. Aim for a weekly average\u2014don\u2019t jump from 2500 to 1500 overnight. Try 2200 for a week, then 2000, then 1800, then 1700. A \u201ckitchen closed\u201d time after dinner helps.\\n\\nPrioritize satiety. Get protein and fiber at every meal (eggs/Greek yogurt/chicken/beans + a big pile of veggies). Volume foods are your friend: soups, salads, stir\u2011fries, popcorn, berries. Most people find this makes 1500\u20131700 way easier.\\n\\nReplace boredom with a tiny action list. When the \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d itch hits, pick one 5\u2011minute thing: walk outside, tidy one surface, 20 squats, shower, read 5 pages, learn 10 vocab words.
