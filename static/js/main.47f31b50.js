My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I\u2019m not as productive as I\u2019d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I\u2019m just so disappointed in my self. It\u2019s hard to drink water. I\u2019m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I\u2019m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I\u2019m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I\u2019m just mad at life. I\u2019m not depressed I\u2019m just disappointed. \\n\\nI\u2019m a ball full of energy. I\u2019m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I\u2019m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I\u2019m a caffeine addict. I don\u2019t know how I will function without my meds when I\u2019m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body.

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\\n\\nYou wouldn\'t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what\'s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\\n\\nThat\'s how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol","percentile_10_comment":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That\u2019s why you feel like you have no energy.  It\u2019s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it\u2019s worth it.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve been in a similar loop with ADHD meds, caffeine, lousy food, and guilt, so here\u2019s what\u2019s actually helped me crawl out of the spiral and get some real traction.\\n\\nTreat the medicated and un\u2011medicated days as two different \u201cmodes\u201d with their own expectations. On Vyvanse days aim for the heavy cognitive stuff (studying, trading practice, paperwork) and block it in short \u201cwork sprints\u201d\u201425 minutes of focus, 5 minutes off, three rounds, then a longer break. Put just three must\u2011do items on the schedule; finishing them earns you a win, everything else is extra credit. On off\u2011days switch the goal to recovery and low\u2011bandwidth habits: meal\u2011prep, laundry, a walk, stretching, refilling your water bottle every time you open the fridge. When the bar is realistic you stop burning willpower on beating yourself up.\\n\\nFood: decide it once, not three times a day. Sunday evening plan five simple, repeatable meals you don\u2019t hate (e.g., overnight oats, rotisserie\u2011chicken salad kits, frozen veg + rice + sauce). Prep or portion them right away so \u201cwhat should I eat?\u201d never becomes a question. Store junk food somewhere you\u2019d have to leave the house to get\u2014future\u2011you rarely wants to put on shoes just for Oreos. For water, tie it to something you already do: every bathroom break = 8 oz, every coffee = finish a full bottle first. If plain water is painful, add zero\u2011calorie flavor drops or go bubbly.\\n\\nMovement: 10\u2011minute micro\u2011workouts beat zero\u2011minute perfect workouts. Bodyweight circuits, YouTube yoga, or a brisk walk around the block keep the streak alive on lethargic days and blunt the urge to binge. Momentum matters more than intensity.\\n\\nPhones and dopamine: put your most distracting apps in a folder called \u201cLater\u201d on the last screen, turn on grayscale after 9\xa0p.m., and leave the charger across the room so grabbing the phone is an active choice. When the itch hits, set a 10\u2011minute timer\u2014if you still want to scroll after it rings, go ahead; half the time the urge passes.\\n\\nPlan for the inevitable crash days: write a short rescue checklist (\u201cdrink water, shower, 10\u2011min walk, text a friend\u201d) and tape it where you\u2019ll see it first thing. Following it keeps a bad day from becoming a bad week.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t confuse discipline with punishment. You\u2019re not broken; your brain just needs clearer systems than most people\u2019s. Nail one small ritual at a time, celebrate it, then stack the next one on top. Six months of that beats any heroic Monday\u2011morning overhaul. You already care enough to ask for help\u2014that\u2019s the hardest part. Now give yourself permission to improve in boring, unsexy, relentlessly consistent steps. It works.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, you\u2019re not a failure\u2014seriously. You\u2019re juggling a lot, and the fact that you\u2019re self-aware and want to change is a huge step. Discipline isn\u2019t about being perfect or never slipping up; it\u2019s about building systems that help you get back on track when you do. For ADHD and binge eating, it\u2019s extra tough because your brain is wired to chase quick rewards, so you have to outsmart it a bit.\\n\\nStart small. Don\u2019t try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one thing\u2014like drinking more water or eating a better breakfast\u2014and make it your main focus for a week or two. Set reminders on your phone, put a water bottle where you\u2019ll see it, whatever helps. Once that feels more automatic, add something else. For binge eating, try to notice your triggers and swap in a different activity (even just stepping outside or texting a friend) before you eat. It won\u2019t be perfect, but every time you interrupt the cycle, you\u2019re making progress.\\n\\nOn days off meds, expect to feel off, but don\u2019t beat yourself up. Plan for lower energy: maybe do a short walk instead of a full workout, or set a timer for 10 minutes of focused work. Even a little bit counts. For focus, try the Pomodoro method (25 minutes on, 5 off) and keep your phone in another room. Motivation comes and goes, but discipline is about showing up even when you don\u2019t feel like it. The more you practice, the easier it gets.\\n\\nIf you fall off, just restart. Don\u2019t wait for a new week or month\u2014just pick up where you left off. Progress isn\u2019t linear, and nobody is disciplined 100% of the time. You\u2019re already doing a lot right, so give yourself some credit. Keep showing up, keep tweaking your systems, and over time you\u2019ll build the habits you want.

No Tik Tok, no Instagram, no Facebook- nothing that will allow me to mindlessly scroll. It has actually caused me to pick up a book and read. \\n2. When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself \u201cWhat is something small I can do right now?\u201d. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I\u2019m not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in 1 go, but I have at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something. \\n3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud \u201cDon\u2019t put it down- put it away.\u201d This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. \\n\\nMaybe these will help you move forward.

Before I started to read it, I wondered if maybe I was depressed. And truthfully, maybe I still am.

A simple way to break the paralysis\u2011by\u2011overwhelm loop is to shrink the size of the first move until it\u2019s almost laughably easy. Pick one task that actually matters this week\u2014say, reading for class, cleaning the desk, updating a r\xe9sum\xe9\u2014and commit to touching it for five minutes today. Set a timer, do the five minutes, then walk away guilt\u2011free. Most of the time you\u2019ll keep going because starting is the hard part, but even if you stop you\u2019ve still logged a win and proved to your brain that \u201cI do what I say.\u201d\\n\\nOnce you have a couple of five\u2011minute wins under your belt, schedule them for the same time each day so it turns into a default routine rather than a decision. Stack a cue you already do (morning coffee, lunch break, shutting the laptop at night) with the tiny task, then reward yourself immediately after\u2014something as small as a stretch, a song, or scrolling Reddit. That cue\u2011routine\u2011reward loop is what slowly rewires the mindset you\u2019re talking about.\\n\\nNext level: create tomorrow\u2019s to\u2011do list tonight and limit it to three items max. Anything else you finish is a bonus. When the list is short you spend less energy choosing and more energy doing. Use an actual timer (Pomodoro, 25/5, whatever) so you can\u2019t wander into YouTube or TikTok without noticing.\\n\\nKeep tracking the streak on paper or in an app; humans hate breaking streaks. Expect off days and treat them like speed bumps, not roadblocks\u2014just restart the streak the next morning without the self\u2011talk spiral. Discipline is basically momentum plus memory: the more often you see evidence that you can start, the easier it is to believe you\u2019ll keep going.\\n\\nTry this for two weeks, then widen the time block or add a second five\u2011minute habit.

The overwhelm you\u2019re describing is super common, especially when you\u2019re trying to break out of a rut. One thing that helps is to stop thinking about \u201cdoing everything\u201d and just pick one small, specific thing to do today. It could be as simple as making your bed, writing a to-do list, or spending 10 minutes on a task you\u2019ve been putting off. The key is to make it so easy you can\u2019t really say no. Once you do that, you\u2019ll start to build a little momentum, and it gets easier to add more over time.

That\u2019s enough to start making deliberate moves instead of drifting. Try treating the next twelve months like a personal turnaround plan with three pillars\u2014income, structure, and community.\\n\\nIncome first. Turn job\u2011hunting into a daily habit, not a mood\u2011based activity. Pick a set time each weekday (say 9\u201111am) where the phone goes on airplane mode and you do one thing that moves the ball: tweak the r\xe9sum\xe9, send applications, follow up on an old lead, or take an online micro\u2011course that upgrades a line on your CV. Track it on paper so you can literally see the streak build. Momentum here will reduce a lot of the background anxiety you\u2019ve got about the future.\\n\\nStructure next. You already work out; expand that into a simple morning routine that starts the day on rails: wake at the same time, drink water, make the bed, 15\u2011minute walk, then your workout. Lay clothes out the night before so there\u2019s zero decision fatigue. When the routine becomes automatic you free up willpower for bigger goals.\\n\\nCommunity last, but crucial. Isolation makes everything else harder. The fastest, cheapest way to get around people who won\u2019t ghost you is volunteering. Animal shelters, food banks, park cleanups\u2014pick something that takes two or three hours a week. You\u2019ll add structure, meet people who value contribution over social polish, and you may stumble into job leads. If you enjoy fitness, consider a group class or even studying for a personal\u2011trainer cert; that turns an existing interest into a social and possibly paid activity.\\n\\nExpect awkwardness at first. Do it anyway, log it, and see how you feel after thirty days. If emotions stay rough, add a therapist to the mix; savings are well spent on getting your mind running clean.\\n\\nThe short version: one disciplined job\u2011search block a day, one locked\u2011in morning routine, one weekly commitment that puts you around other humans. Keep those promises to yourself for a quarter and your life will look noticeably different\u2014maybe not \u201cfixed,\u201d but moving, and that\u2019s what counts.

The fact that you\u2019re physically active is a solid foundation, so give yourself credit for that. If you want to start building a life you\u2019re proud of, try focusing on small, consistent actions. For example, set a simple daily routine: wake up at the same time, get some sunlight, do your fitness thing, and add one new habit (like reading for 10 minutes, journaling, or applying to one job a day). Don\u2019t worry about making friends or finding a relationship right away\u2014those things tend to come when you\u2019re working on yourself and putting yourself out there, even in small ways. Volunteering or joining a local club can help you meet people and feel like you\u2019re making a difference, even if it\u2019s just a couple hours a week.

However, it takes a lot of my time and it\u2019s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don\u2019t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it\u2019s cheap in India) but I don\u2019t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it\u2019s another hassle to manage. \\nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\\nIs it too much to ask ? Please help.\\nAlso, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.","comments":{"best_comment":"Cook in Batches like for 2/3 days. It saves a good chunck of time and you can use it for purposes. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.","percentile_10_comment":"Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it","comment_o3":"I\u2019m in the same boat with a full\u2011time job and no outside help, and the only way I\u2019ve made it work is by turning everything into a system instead of a daily decision. Pick one grocery day and one bulk\u2011cooking block per week\u2014Saturday morning, Sunday evening, whatever\u2014and treat them like non\u2011negotiable appointments. On grocery day you buy for a fixed menu of 3\u20114 simple dishes that all share ingredients (for example: chana masala, stir\u2011fried veggies, and lemon rice use overlapping onions, tomatoes, peppers, and spices). On cooking day you batch\u2011cook double or triple portions, portion them into individual containers, and stack them in the fridge/freezer. Reheating when you get home takes five minutes, so dinner and tomorrow\u2019s lunch are sorted and the mental chatter about what to eat disappears.\\n\\nA cheap pressure cooker or Instant Pot pays for itself in time: throw soaked lentils + veggies + spices in the morning, set delay timer, and it\u2019s ready when you walk through the door. One\u2011pot dishes also mean almost no dishes\u2014lid, pot, spoon, done. For the rest of the kitchen mess, wash as you cook; you\u2019re standing there watching something simmer anyway.\\n\\nHousework is the same \u201csmall daily, bigger weekly\u201d system. Set a 10\u2011minute timer every night for a quick reset of the living room and dishes, and a 30\u2011minute timer on Sunday for sweeping, mopping, and bathroom wipe\u2011down. That\u2019s under two hours total per week, far less than the mental load of wondering when you\u2019ll clean. If you ever fall behind, hire a maid for a one\u2011off deep clean, then go back to your maintenance routine.\\n\\nFor workouts, don\u2019t chase a perfect 90\u2011minute gym session. A 20\u2011minute bodyweight circuit or yoga flow right after waking will move your energy up a notch. Lay out clothes and a mat the night before so 8\xa0a.m. you roll out of bed and start, no thinking required. Once that habit sticks you can decide whether getting up earlier is worth the extra training time.\\n\\nThe common thread is front\u2011loading decisions. Decide once a week what you\u2019ll eat, when groceries happen, when cooking happens, when cleaning happens, and when you exercise. Put those blocks on your calendar the same way you\u2019d schedule meetings, then run the script. It feels rigid at first, but the payoff is all the free headspace after work to actually relax instead of juggling chores.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, what you\u2019re describing is super common when you first start living alone and taking on all the responsibilities yourself. It\u2019s not too much to ask to want a balance, but it does take some trial and error to find a routine that works. For cooking, try meal prepping on weekends or your least busy day\u2014make a big batch of something simple (like dal, sabzi, or khichdi) that you can eat for a couple of meals. You can also chop veggies and store them in the fridge for a few days, so daily cooking is faster. For cleaning, set a timer for 10-15 minutes each day after dinner and just do a quick tidy or dishes\u2014don\u2019t let it pile up. If you can afford a maid, maybe consider hiring one just for cleaning (not cooking), so you have less to manage. As for workouts, even a 10-minute routine in the morning is a good start; consistency matters more than duration. Waking up earlier is a gradual process\u2014try moving your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier every few days instead of a big jump. Most importantly, don\u2019t aim for perfection. Some days will be messy, and that\u2019s fine. The key is to build small, sustainable habits that make your life easier, not harder. You\u2019ve already taken the hardest step by being aware and wanting to improve\u2014just keep tweaking your routine until it feels manageable."}},{"id":"t3_v3f7wv","title":"[need advice] how to effectively lessen time on social media \xbf","body":"I use my phone when I get tired of doing tasks but I realized that I waste most of my time just scrolling down my phone and I tend not to notice how much time it consumes.

The experience is so garbage you won\u2019t want to use it for long","comment_o3":"What worked for me was attacking the problem from two angles: shrink the temptation window and give my brain a better\u2011quality break. First, make the phone slightly annoying to use. Log out of the social apps, bury them in a folder on the last screen, turn off all non\u2011essential notifications, and set the display to grayscale. If it takes an extra 10\u201315 seconds of friction to open Instagram, you\u2019ll often decide it isn\u2019t worth it. Second, decide ahead of time what \u201ctired\u201d you really means\u2014do you need movement, stimulation, or just a pause? Pick a replacement activity you can start in under a minute: a five\u2011minute walk, ten push\u2011ups, a short guided breathing video on YouTube (downloaded so you don\u2019t wander), or even standing up to stretch while listening to one song. Couple this with a timer like Pomodoro: work 25 minutes, then take a five\u2011minute intentional break that you\u2019ve chosen in advance. When the break ends, phone goes face\u2011down in another room or desk drawer until the next cycle. Finally, track it. Each day note how many cycles you ran without scrolling\u2014seeing the streak build is surprisingly motivating.

Try moving the apps off your home screen or logging out after each use so there\u2019s an extra step before you can start scrolling. You could also set app timers or use features like Focus Mode to limit your usage. When you catch yourself reaching for your phone out of habit, try swapping in a different quick break\u2014like stretching, getting a glass of water, or stepping outside for a minute.

Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don\'t know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \\"I didn\'t have much more to say\\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn\'t write her and she didn\'t write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it\'s something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything.

My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn\'t went to gym anymore for years).\\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\\\--\x3e Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \\n \\n\\n**My two biggest issues**\\n\\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\\\--\x3e For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn\'t message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it\'s really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \\"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\\" and the thought really really scares me.  \\n \\n* **Dating** \\\\--\x3e In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it\'s exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don\'t want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \\"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \\n \\n\\n**I really don\'t know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share.

Pick the single habit that would make everything else easier and nail it for 60\u201190 days. For most people in your situation that\u2019s consistent exercise because it\u2019s an anchor: it floods you with endorphins, regulates sleep, gives you something to do when urges hit, and grows self\u2011respect. Your plan can be as simple as three strength workouts and two 30\u2011minute walks per week, booked on your calendar like classes you can\u2019t skip. When you\u2019re sick or busy, keep the streak alive with an ultra\u2011tiny version\u2014five minutes of push\u2011ups or stretching counts.

Order a soda with lime as soon as you arrive so your hands aren\u2019t empty. Track nights alcohol\u2011free on a calendar; watching a streak grow scratches the same dopamine itch drinking used to.\\n\\nPorn is a stimulus\u2011response loop like any other. Remove the stimulus (blockers, phone out of bedroom, no screens after 11), replace the response (cold shower, short walk, text a friend) and expect withdrawal waves for two weeks.

Give yourself permission to focus on friendships, study, and the habits above until you land in the exchange semester. Loneliness won\u2019t kill you; chasing new matches while you\u2019re unstable might. If someone amazing crosses your path organically, great, but deleting the apps removes the \u201cshould I swipe?\u201d bandwidth tax and lets you prove to yourself that you can be content solo.\\n\\nFinally, therapy usually feels unproductive right before the real work starts.

That alone makes it feel practical.\\n\\nTL;DR: pick exercise as your keystone habit, guard it like a class, layer in alcohol rules, treat porn slips as data, pause the dating apps, and give therapy another structured shot.

I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\\n\\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don\u2019t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked.

Give a friend the password or use a random one\u2011time generator so you can\u2019t bypass it in a weak moment.\\n\\nNext, swap the bedtime cue. Right now arousal equals sleep because you\u2019ve trained your brain that way. Pick a different, non\u2011sexual wind\u2011down ritual and commit to it for thirty nights.

Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it\'s questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\\n\\nThat\'s what I do sometimes and it works.

The trick is separating the moment you feel an emotion from the moment you act on it. One simple way is the \u201cpause and label\u201d habit: when something hits you, name the emotion out loud or in writing (\u201cthat\u2019s anger,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s disappointment\u201d). The tiny act of labeling moves the experience from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, giving you a short window to think instead of react.\\n\\nWhile you\u2019re in that window, run a preset protocol rather than ad\u2011libbing. Mine is a notebook page with three questions: What exactly happened? What do I want to do right now? What would I tell a friend to do? Writing it forces me to translate raw feelings into concrete statements, and looking at that third answer often exposes the gap between impulse and wisdom. If I\u2019m still unsure, I wait 24 hours before taking any irreversible action\u2014love confessions, angry emails, quitting a job, whatever. Most emotional whiplash cools off in a day; if it still feels right after the wait, I trust it more.\\n\\nBuild a daily practice that trains this skill when the stakes are low. Ten minutes of mindfulness meditation or breath counting literally rewires the brain for better impulse control; five minutes of journaling each morning keeps a running log of patterns that cloud your judgment. Physical outlets help too\u2014lifting, running, even walks\u2014because a calm nervous system is easier to reason with.\\n\\nFinally, decide once, not every time. For recurring situations (dating red flags, spending limits, staying up late), write a short set of personal policies while you\u2019re calm. Next time your emotions flare, the decision is already made and you just follow the policy, no debate required.\\n\\nYou\u2019re not weak for feeling things strongly; you just need a system that catches the emotion, channels it, and lets logic have its say. Give the above a 30\u2011day trial, track your results, and adjust.

One thing that helps is building a habit of pausing before reacting\u2014literally taking a few deep breaths or even stepping away for a few minutes when you feel a strong emotion. This gives your logical brain a chance to catch up. Journaling can also be useful: write down what you\u2019re feeling and what you think the logical action is, then revisit it after some time has passed. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and get better at separating what you want to do in the moment from what\u2019s actually best for you. It\u2019s not about suppressing emotions, but about acknowledging them without letting them run the show.

Mute Slack, close email, set a timer for 25\u2011minute sprints (Pomodoro), and pick one bite\u2011sized task: reading a design doc, fixing a tiny bug, writing a unit test. Ship or document something tangible by the end of the block.

Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I\'m not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn\'t even went to give my exams \\n\\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \\n\\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \\n\\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don\'t  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don\'t distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \\n\\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I\'m gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow.

Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you\'re most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\\n\\nLife is short, but it\'s longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone\'s success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\\n\\nFigure out what you want - it doesn\'t have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \\"to travel the world\\" or \\"to buy a house\\" or \\"get married and raise a family\\" or as simple as \\"get a job that lets you live comfortably\\". Figure out what it is.\\n\\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what\'s important to you and start today, then do it every day.\\n\\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it\'s get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it\'s getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \\n\\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point.

The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\\n\\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

Go to your school\u2019s advising or registrar office tomorrow, in person, and ask about a late withdrawal or leave of absence for last semester. Schools usually have a process that lets you wipe F\u2019s off the transcript if you can document a medical/mental\u2011health issue; at worst they can tell you the deadline and your exact GPA situation so you know what you\u2019re dealing with. While you\u2019re there, ask what would happen to your scholarship if you sit out a semester\u2014get facts before making the decision. That information will make the conversation with your dad and the scholarship provider a lot easier, because you can present a plan instead of just a confession: \u201cI had a rough first semester, I\u2019ve spoken with the school, I\u2019m taking a leave/retaking the classes, here\u2019s the timeline and what I\u2019m doing to fix it.\u201d\\n\\nSecond, treat the porn loop like any other compulsive behavior: remove frictionless access and add frictionless alternatives. Put your gaming PC/console in a common area or box it up and leave it at a friend\u2019s for a month. Install blocking software that only a friend has the password to. Use your phone or a library computer for schoolwork so you can\u2019t alter the blocker. When the urge hits, stand up, leave the room, and do ten push\u2011ups, walk outside, or open your textbook\u2014teach your brain that the cue leads somewhere else. If you relapse, no moral drama; log it and reset the counter.\\n\\nThird, shrink your study sessions to something you cannot refuse. Literally set a timer for five minutes, open the syllabus, and start. When five minutes are up you can quit\u2014most of the time you\u2019ll keep going. Pair that with a hard daily cutoff: once it\u2019s 6\xa0p.m. you\u2019re done for the day, no guilt, which prevents the \u201cI wasted the morning so the day is ruined\u201d spiral.\\n\\nFourth, get humans involved.

Tell one friend what you\u2019re trying to fix and text them a photo of your study space each time you start a session\u2014accountability doesn\u2019t have to be deep, it just has to exist.\\n\\nTaking a semester off can work if you treat it like rehab, not vacation: structured schedule, part\u2011time job for routine, counseling, daily exercise, and clocked study blocks to retake or prep classes. Gather the facts from your school first, then decide. Whatever you choose, move on it this week\u2014the sooner you act, the smaller the mess gets.

You can say you struggled with motivation and time management, and you\u2019re working on getting help and making changes. It\u2019s better than letting them find out on their own or making excuses that fall apart later.\\n\\nAbout the addiction and procrastination: blockers and willpower alone rarely work long-term. The key is to change your environment and routines so it\u2019s harder to fall into old habits.

Replace the \u201cpleasure-then-game\u201d cycle with something else\u2014literally anything that gets you out of your room and moving, even if it\u2019s just a walk or a quick workout. The urge to wander or nap when you\u2019re supposed to work is super common; it\u2019s your brain dodging discomfort. Try the \u201c2-minute rule\u201d from Atomic Habits: commit to just two minutes of the task, then see if you can keep going. Sometimes just starting is the hardest part.\\n\\nAs for skipping the semester, that\u2019s a big decision. If you\u2019re truly not ready and you have the option, taking a break to reset can help, but only if you use that time to actually work on your habits and mental health\u2014not just to escape.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner.

Put the guitar on a stand in the middle of the room so it\u2019s the first thing you see after work or school, and make a rule that you touch it before you touch your phone or the TV remote.

The idea is to rebuild your discipline muscle with wins that are too small to fail, then gradually layer them until you\u2019re back to a routine you\u2019re proud of. If you ever fall off again, return to the five\u2011minute rule instead of beating yourself up.

I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\\\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over.

I\'ll not get too much into it but I\'m miserable during the weekdays. I\'m also in a new job so I\'m constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here\'s what my week looks like - \\n\\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it\'s time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \\n\\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \\n\\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I\'ve been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\\n\\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","comments":{"best_comment":"I personally don\'t think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that\'s the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn\'t have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\\n\\nI can\'t speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","percentile_10_comment":"You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).","comment_o3":"Been there during the peak of lockdown \u2013 weekdays felt like an airport lounge where I was just killing time until the flight to Friday. A few changes pulled me out of that loop.\\n\\nFirst, put a fence around work. WFH blurs the edges, so you have to draw them yourself. Decide a hard shut\u2011down time (say 7\xa0pm), put it in your calendar, tell your manager you\u2019ll be offline after that unless there\u2019s an emergency, then actually close the laptop and put it in a drawer. Most bosses won\u2019t push back if you\u2019re delivering; the boundary forces you to work with more intention and keeps the evenings clear for life.\\n\\nSecond, treat each weekday like a mini\u2011weekend by scheduling one small \u201canchor\u201d you genuinely look forward to. Could be a 30\u2011minute guitar lesson on Monday night, a pick\u2011up basketball game on Tuesday, a fancy coffee and a book on Wednesday morning, whatever. When there\u2019s something positive waiting at 6\xa0pm, the day stops feeling like an endurance test.\\n\\nThird, give your body a reason to get out of bed. Set the alarm for the same time every day, get vertical immediately (phone across the room helps), splash water on your face and step outside for 2 minutes of sunlight or a daylight lamp. Follow it with 5\u201310 push\u2011ups, squats, or stretching. Tiny, but it signals to your brain that the day has started and it\u2019s no longer sleep time.\\n\\nFourth, clean up the coping loop with food by changing the environment, not your willpower. Keep trigger snacks out of the house, prep easy high\u2011protein meals on Sunday so Weekday\u2011You doesn\u2019t have to think, and put fruit or nuts where the chips used to be. If the only \u201clazy\u201d option is something decent, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll eat.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t try to make peace with a 40\u2011year sentence. Think in 3\u2011month experiments. \u201cFor the next quarter I\u2019ll hold a 7\xa0pm work curfew, lift on M/W/F, and practice Spanish T/Th for 20 minutes.\u201d Review, tweak, repeat. Careers, companies, and you will all change many times before retirement. Your job is to build routines and skills that travel with you.\\n\\nWeekends will still be fun, they just won\u2019t be the only time you feel alive. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, a lot of people fall into the \u201cliving for the weekend\u201d trap, especially with WFH blurring the lines between work and life. The first thing to realize is that you don\u2019t have to accept that this is how it\u2019ll be for the next 40 years\u2014things can change, but it takes small, intentional steps. One thing that helps is building little rituals or activities during the week that you actually look forward to, even if they\u2019re minor. It could be a walk after work, a hobby you do for 30 minutes, or even just making a good cup of coffee and reading something you enjoy. The point is to break up the monotony and give yourself something to anticipate that isn\u2019t just the weekend.\\n\\nAbout the work stress and underperforming: try setting a clear \u201cend\u201d to your workday, even if it\u2019s just shutting your laptop and physically moving to a different space. It\u2019s easy to let work bleed into your whole day, but having a hard stop can help your brain switch gears. If you\u2019re worried about performance, pick one or two small, concrete things to improve each week instead of trying to overhaul everything at once.\\n\\nFor the food and sleep stuff, it\u2019s worth experimenting with a morning routine that gets you out of bed for something other than work\u2014maybe a quick walk, stretching, or even just sitting by a window with music. The goal isn\u2019t to be super productive, but to give your mind a reason to get up that isn\u2019t just obligation.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to love every day, but you can make them less miserable by sprinkling in small things you enjoy and setting boundaries around work. Over time, those little changes add up and make the weeks feel less like something to \u201cget through.\u201d Hang in there\u2014it\u2019s possible to build a life where you don\u2019t dread Monday through Thursday."}},{"id":"t3_vpyfhz","title":"[Need Advice] Strong pull toward inaction when it comes to doing unpleasant activities.","body":"For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I\'d legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I\'ve done just that before.\\n\\nI realize it will ultimately come to \\"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\\" which is fine. But ideally I\'d like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","comments":{"best_comment":"Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\\n\\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\\n\\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you\u2019re more than capable, and just start again.\\n\\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.","percentile_10_comment":"I realised recently my messy room was a coping mechanism.

The trick isn\u2019t to eliminate the feeling (because it\u2019ll probably always pop up), but to make it easier to act despite it. One thing that helps is lowering the activation energy\u2014tell yourself you\u2019ll just clean for 2 minutes, or only pick up 5 things. Once you start, it\u2019s way easier to keep going. Also, try to make the task less unpleasant: put on music, set a timer, or reward yourself after.

Most people who claim they can crank out six deep\u2011work hours got there by building up in small blocks, not by flipping a switch. Instead of lowering the daily goal, try reframing it: commit to one focused 25\u2011minute sprint, then decide whether to do another. Stack those sprints until you hit three hours or until you call it for the day. If you only manage two sprints, you still practiced the skill and logged exactly how long you lasted, so you have real data to beat tomorrow.\\n\\nMake the sessions easier to start. The night before, write down the single most specific task you\u2019ll attack first\u2014e.g., \u201cWrite introduction paragraph,\u201d not \u201cWork on website.\u201d When you sit down, there\u2019s zero decision fatigue; you just press play. Pair that with a short pre\u2011work ritual (brew coffee, put phone in another room, open only the files you need). Linking the ritual to the first sprint cues your brain that \u201cthis is work time,\u201d the same way tying your shoes cues your brain it\u2019s gym time.\\n\\nThe lack of immediate payoff is normal for knowledge work, so manufacture one. Keep a visible log of completed tasks or minutes\u2014crossing them off provides the quick dopamine hit you get from a pump in the gym. Schedule a small, guilt\u2011free reward after your last sprint: a walk, a game, whatever. The brain starts associating the end of a work session with something pleasant, making the next session easier to initiate.\\n\\nAs for not caring about \u201cmaking bank,\u201d focus on the reason this business exists for you besides money. Is it learning a skill, earning freedom, solving a problem you find interesting? If you can\u2019t identify a why that resonates, you may be forcing yourself toward a goal you don\u2019t value, and no productivity hack will fix that. Either uncover a motivating purpose or pivot to work that does matter to you.\\n\\nFinally, expect fluctuation. Professional writers, developers, and academics have off days too; they just show up anyway and protect the habit. Treat each session as practice, not a performance. If you string together weeks of consistent 25\u2011minute blocks, you\u2019ll look back and realize you\u2019re already doing the three\u2011hour days you thought were impossible.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, it\u2019s super common to hit a wall after a couple of good days, especially when you\u2019re trying to build a new habit. Three hours of focused work is actually a lot if you\u2019re not used to it, so there\u2019s nothing wrong with starting smaller and ramping up. You might find it easier to break your work into shorter chunks\u2014like 25-30 minutes with breaks in between\u2014rather than trying to power through hours at a time. Also, if you\u2019re not feeling much reward or meaning from the work itself, it can help to set up some kind of immediate payoff for finishing your sessions, even if it\u2019s just a small treat or a bit of downtime. Not everyone is wired to grind for hours on end, and that\u2019s fine. The key is consistency, not perfection. If you can reliably do even an hour a day, that\u2019s a solid foundation to build on.

He makes the claim that this idea of finding your passion is mostly nonsense. Instead, real passion is forged through years of effort and dedication. (He gives a more nuanced take in the book though)","percentile_10_comment":"GYM GYM GYM GYM","comment_o3":"A lot of people wait to \u201cdiscover\u201d a passion when what usually happens is they stumble into it after a stretch of focused doing. Think of it less like hunting for buried treasure and more like running a series of short, deliberate experiments. Pick one direction that feels promising\u2014physical sciences, for example, since that was the last time you remember genuine interest\u2014and give it a six\u2011month sprint. During that time build a simple, repeatable routine: spend an hour a day on foundational study, an hour on a hands\u2011on side project (could be a small electronics kit, a data\u2011analysis notebook, a short explanatory video), and finish each session by writing two sentences about what felt energizing and what felt draining. At the three\u2011month mark reread those notes. If your average day still feels like the \u201cdry hole,\u201d pivot to the next experiment on the list. If the notes are trending positive, double down for another six months.\\n\\nTwo rules keep the process honest: cap your experiments at one or two simultaneous commitments so you don\u2019t spread thin, and make sure each one ends with something concrete you can show\u2014an Arduino gadget, a Medium article, a five\u2011minute explainer on YouTube. Tangible outputs give you real feedback and build a portfolio at the same time.\\n\\nYou already like problem\u2011solving and reaching people, so look for intersections: science communication, data journalism, user\u2011research inside tech, or even product management where micro\u2011economics, psychology, and design all collide. Those fields reward honesty and have broad impact, which matches your values. And if you still want to try the self\u2011help or daily\u2011routine channel, run it the same way: schedule six weeks, script ten short videos, post them on a fixed cadence, then review the numbers and your own enthusiasm before deciding whether to scale.\\n\\nDiscipline here isn\u2019t about iron willpower; it\u2019s about building a small structure that makes these experiments automatic. Block the time on your calendar, set a visible tracker on your wall, and commit to not breaking the chain for the full sprint. Whether or not any single project becomes \u201cthe one,\u201d you\u2019ll come out with stronger habits, clearer data on what excites you, and a growing stack of skills you can leverage anywhere.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019ve already done a lot of the hard work by trying different things and reflecting on what actually matters to you. That \u201cdry hole\u201d feeling is super common when you\u2019re searching for something that feels meaningful, so don\u2019t beat yourself up for not having it all figured out at 27. If you\u2019re looking for a sense of purpose, sometimes it helps to focus less on finding a single \u201cpassion\u201d and more on building habits around things you\u2019re curious about\u2014even if they don\u2019t feel like a grand calling yet. For example, if physical sciences were the last thing you felt genuinely interested in, maybe set aside a small, consistent block of time each week to dive back in\u2014read, take an online course, or even join a local group if that\u2019s an option. Over time, discipline in exploring these interests can help you rediscover what excites you, and you might find new angles you hadn\u2019t considered before.\\n\\nAlso, since you value honesty and connecting with people, maybe try combining those with your skills\u2014like making content that helps others learn or solve problems (self-help, routines, or even breaking down complex topics in a relatable way). You don\u2019t have to commit to a full career pivot right away; just start small, build a routine around creating or sharing, and see what sticks. The key is to keep showing up, even when you\u2019re not 100% sure where it\u2019s leading. Purpose often comes from action and consistency, not just inspiration.

It won\'t magically fix everything, but I feel like it\'s a good first step.","comment_o3":"Quick wins first, then bigger moves.\\n\\nStart with sleep. Everything you wrote (energy, focus, weight, mood) gets worse when you\u2019re chronically underslept. Pick a single, non\u2011negotiable wake\u2011up time that gives you 7\u20138 hours if you were asleep by 2\xa0a.m. Even if you lie awake, get up at that set time; the mild pain trains your body to fall asleep earlier within a week or two. Kill screens and bright lights 60\xa0min before bed, caffeine after noon, and alcohol on study nights. If you snore, wake up gasping, or feel dead tired no matter what, ask a doctor about sleep apnea\u2014tons of \u201coverweight, always tired, ADHD that meds don\u2019t fix\u201d folks discover that\u2019s the real culprit.\\n\\nNext, create a 30\u2011minute morning \u201claunch sequence.\u201d Water, quick stretch, meds, review today\u2019s three priorities, 10\u2011minute apartment tidy. That little clean\u2011up stops the shame spiral and gives you a daily victory before work.\\n\\nFor ADHD productivity, treat tasks like reps at the gym: short, counted, and timed. Use a 25/5 Pomodoro timer and aim for just two of those before lunch. Put your phone in another room, open only what you need, and start with something that takes five minutes to finish so your brain gets the dopamine hit. Momentum matters more than ambition right now.\\n\\nThe law degree feels huge because it\u2019s undefined. Break the remaining six months into weekly deliverables (e.g., \u201cRead and outline Chapter 3 cases by Friday\u201d). Track them on a wall calendar you can physically mark. When you hit four weeks of green X\u2019s, reward yourself with something guilt\u2011free.\\n\\nAbout work: spend the first 15 minutes of every day writing the ONE thing that will get you fired if you ignore it. Do that first. Email your boss a short \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m on today\u201d note; light accountability works wonders, and they\u2019ll likely appreciate the visibility.\\n\\nFinances: open a spreadsheet tonight, list every debt, minimum payment, and interest rate\u2014ugly truth on one page. Tomorrow call each collector and set up an autopay plan. Once a payment schedule exists, the mental noise drops dramatically.\\n\\nThe apartment: set a timer for 10 minutes after work and fill one trash bag. Stop when the timer rings. Repeat daily. Small doses bypass the overwhelm and, inside a month, the place will look completely different.\\n\\nFinally, don\u2019t try to \u201cfeel motivated.\u201d Act first, mood follows. Keep the commitments tiny, track them visibly, and stack small wins. Six months of steady, boring reps will rescue the degree, calm the job situation, clear the room, and shrink the debt. You\u2019ll still be you\u2014just a version that finishes things.

The good news is, you\u2019ve already done the hardest part by being honest about where you\u2019re at and wanting to change. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d suggest: forget about fixing everything at once. Pick one small, concrete thing you can do every day, even if it feels almost stupidly easy. For example, make your bed every morning, or spend 5 minutes tidying your room, or set a timer for 10 minutes of focused study. The point is to build momentum and prove to yourself that you can follow through, even in tiny ways. Once that\u2019s a habit, add another. For sleep, try to get up at the same time every day, even if you didn\u2019t sleep well\u2014consistency helps reset your body clock over time. For ADHD, meds aren\u2019t magic, but structure and external accountability can help a lot. Use reminders, alarms, or even ask a friend to check in on your progress. As for the law degree, break it down into micro-tasks\u2014like reading one page or writing one paragraph\u2014and don\u2019t worry about the big picture for now. If you\u2019re overwhelmed by your apartment, set a timer for 5 minutes and just start with one corner. Progress is progress, no matter how small. And if you can, talk to a professional about the exhaustion and sleep issues\u2014sometimes there\u2019s a medical piece that needs attention. You\u2019re not lazy or broken; you just need a system that works for you. Start small, be consistent, and don\u2019t beat yourself up for setbacks.

Around 1\u20133\xa0p.m. your circadian rhythm naturally dips, and a big carb\u2011heavy lunch spikes insulin, shuttles tryptophan to the brain, and you get sleepy. If you\u2019re already carrying some sleep debt, that dip feels like a brick wall. You can\u2019t delete the biology, but you can blunt it enough to stay productive.\\n\\nFirst, audit the meal itself. Swap out huge portions of rice, bread, or pasta for more protein, veggies, and healthy fats, and keep the total calories reasonable. Chase it with a full glass of water\u2014dehydration amplifies fatigue. If you\u2019re a coffee drinker, have the cup right after eating; caffeine takes ~20\xa0minutes to kick in, lining up nicely with the dip.\\n\\nSecond, move immediately. Stand up the moment you finish the last bite and take a 5\u201310\xa0minute brisk walk, ideally outside for sunlight. The combo of light and movement tells your brain it\u2019s still \u201cgo\u201d time and evens out blood glucose.\\n\\nThird, give yourself a controlled outlet. A 15\u201320\xa0minute \u201cpermission nap\u201d (set an alarm, lie on the couch, not the bed) can recharge without letting you drift into a full sleep cycle.

Example: this quarter your primary is French, your daily mini\u2011habit is 20\xa0min on guitar. Block 60\u201390\xa0min for French right after the dog walk when your brain is still alert, set a timer, then stop. The guitar session can live later as a wind\u2011down.

Keep a running \u201clater\u201d list for courses, books, and business ideas so they\u2019re not rattling in your head demanding attention.

The reality is, you *can* do a lot, but not all at once. The trick is to pick 1-2 things to focus on for a set period (like a month or two), and let yourself rotate interests over time. For example, you could dedicate 30 minutes a night to music, and 30 minutes to French, and let the rest be free time or for winding down. Or, you could do music on Mon/Wed/Fri, and French or reading on Tue/Thu. The key is to make a simple, repeatable schedule that you can stick to even when you\u2019re tired. \\n\\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of small, consistent effort. Even 20 minutes a day adds up over months. Also, try to set a \u201cminimum viable\u201d version of each habit\u2014like playing one song, reading 5 pages, or doing 10 minutes of Duolingo\u2014so you can keep momentum on low-energy days. If you\u2019re feeling burnt out, it\u2019s okay to just rest sometimes, but try to avoid defaulting to TV every night. Maybe set a rule: do one productive thing before you turn on the TV.\\n\\nAs for starting a company, that\u2019s a huge goal and will require a lot of time and energy. It might help to treat it as a long-term project and just start by dedicating a small, regular slot each week to brainstorming or research. Once you get momentum, you can ramp up.\\n\\nTL;DR: Pick a couple priorities, make a simple schedule, keep your daily goals small, and rotate interests over time.

I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \\n\\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation.

That\u2019s how I overcame the problem you\u2019re having.","percentile_10_comment":"The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won\'t last. If hope is your motivator, it will. \\n\\nA big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks.

Just have to restart a few times, and that\'s ok.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve dealt with something similar and a few things finally moved the needle for me. First, stop framing it as \u201cI need more discipline.\u201d The word is loaded in your head, so swap it for \u201cexperiments.\u201d Pick a ridiculously small, 5\u2011minute experiment you can do every day for two weeks. For a game dev that might be opening the project and fixing one line or writing one sentence of a design doc, then you\u2019re allowed to quit. For music it could be playing one scale on a single string. It feels stupidly small, but that\u2019s the point: you\u2019re proving to your brain that showing up doesn\u2019t equal pain.\\n\\nSecond, separate outcome from identity. Instead of \u201cI never finish games so I\u2019m undisciplined,\u201d try \u201cI haven\u2019t found a system that lets me finish yet.\u201d Keep a physical notebook and each day write the date and what your 5\u2011minute experiment was. That growing list is concrete evidence that you can follow through, even if the tasks are tiny.\\n\\nThird, outsource structure until it\u2019s boring. Join a coworking Discord with daily check\u2011ins, hire a cheap accountability coach on Focusmate, or book a practice session with a teacher who expects a scale every lesson. External eyes lower the bar to starting because someone else is holding the frame.\\n\\nFourth, treat therapy like a skills coach, not a deep dive into childhood unless you want that. A CBT or schema therapist can help you neutralize the \u201cdiscipline = threat\u201d association with evidence\u2011gathering and exposure exercises, the same way people unlearn phobias.\\n\\nFinally, give yourself a single finish line this year: one tiny, shippable game jam entry, one recorded cover that uses sheet music, whatever. Everything you do funnels toward that one finish, no side quests. When the urge to abandon pops up, remind yourself the whole goal is simply to finish something small once, not to make it perfect.\\n\\nIt\u2019s unglamorous, but stacking laughably easy reps, using outside scaffolding, and aiming for one concrete finish is how I turned the lifelong wall into a speed bump. You can, too. Good luck.","comment_gpt4dot1":"I relate to a lot of what you wrote, and I think you\u2019re onto something important by recognizing that it\u2019s not just about willpower or laziness. For me, what helped was reframing what \u201cdiscipline\u201d even means. Instead of seeing it as this harsh, external force or a test of character, I started thinking of it as a set of small, neutral routines\u2014almost like brushing my teeth. I stopped trying to \u201cbe disciplined\u201d and just tried to do one tiny thing regularly, even if it felt pointless or too easy. Sometimes that meant setting a timer for 2 minutes and just opening my project, not even working on it. Over time, the wall didn\u2019t disappear, but it got less intimidating because I wasn\u2019t trying to scale it all at once.\\n\\nAlso, I had to let go of the idea that shame would motivate me. It never did. If anything, it made the wall higher. So I started tracking the tiniest wins, like \u201copened the music book\u201d or \u201cwrote one line of code,\u201d and gave myself credit for those. It sounds cheesy, but it helped break the all-or-nothing thinking.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t already, it might be worth talking to a therapist who knows about schema stuff, but even without that, you can experiment with making discipline as low-stakes and non-threatening as possible. You don\u2019t have to \u201covercome\u201d the aversion all at once\u2014just make it a little less scary, one small action at a time.

You\'re just human.","comment_o3":"First thing: nothing is \u201cwrong\u201d with you for feeling gutted after a breakup. It hurts because you cared, and caring is not weakness. What matters now is what you do with the energy that\u2019s sloshing around after that loss. Discipline is really just the habit of directing that energy on purpose instead of letting it leak everywhere.\\n\\nStart by giving your days a basic structure. Wake\u2011up time, bed time, three meals, some movement, something productive, something genuinely relaxing. If you nail the fundamentals\u2014sleep, decent food, exercise\u2014you\u2019ll be shocked how much emotional turbulence settles on its own. Pick one anchor habit that you can hit no matter what: a 30\u2011minute walk every morning, a short lift session after work, whatever is sustainable. Treat that habit like brushing your teeth: non\u2011negotiable.\\n\\nNext, train the mind the same way you\u2019re training the body. Ten minutes of meditation, or even just sitting with a notebook and dumping all the messy thoughts onto paper, will teach you to watch emotions instead of being yanked around by them. Pair that with some Stoic or CBT\u2011style reflection: ask yourself, \u201cIs this feeling helpful? Is it telling me to act, or is it just noise?\u201d Over time you\u2019ll get quicker at spotting unhelpful loops and steering back to what you can control.\\n\\nBecause a breakup can leave a huge gap in your social and purpose \u201cbuckets,\u201d deliberately fill them. See friends in person, join a hobby group, volunteer, take a course\u2014anything that reminds you you\u2019re part of something bigger than your own head. Momentum is your friend here; the more small wins you stack, the easier the next one feels.\\n\\nTrack progress somewhere visible\u2014a calendar you don\u2019t want to break, a notes app, whatever. The point isn\u2019t perfection; it\u2019s proving to yourself day after day that you keep promises to yourself. That\u2019s where real confidence comes from, not from never feeling sad again.\\n\\nIf the grief still feels overwhelming after a couple of months of genuine effort, there\u2019s zero shame in talking to a therapist. Think of it as hiring a personal trainer for your head.\\n\\nFinally, remember that discipline isn\u2019t about becoming a stoic robot. It\u2019s about having enough control that you can choose when to be open and when to be reserved. You\u2019re already on that path by asking for help. Keep showing up for yourself and the strength\u2014mental and physical\u2014will follow.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, it\u2019s totally normal to feel lost after a breakup, especially your first real one.

The best way to start is small\u2014pick one daily habit that you can control, like making your bed every morning or going for a short walk. These little wins build up your confidence and show your mind that you can stick to things.

Journaling helps too\u2014just write down what you\u2019re feeling and why, no filter. Over time, you\u2019ll notice patterns and get better at handling them.

Try bumping it to eight for a full week before you decide you\u2019re already sleeping enough; the extra cycle or two makes a surprising difference in alertness.\\n\\nNext, give your brain some non\u2011distracting stimulation instead of trying to work in a sensory vacuum. Instrumental music, white noise, or even caf\xe9\u2011style background chatter tracks won\u2019t hijack you the way TikTok does, but they keep the reticular activating system firing so you don\u2019t drift off. A \u201cdopamine detox\u201d is supposed to cut compulsive novelty, not force you to study in monastic silence.\\n\\nMovement is the other big lever. Every 45\u201360 minutes, stand up, do 20 body\u2011weight squats or push\u2011ups, grab water, look outside at something far away for 30 seconds, then sit back down. It resets circulation and convinces your nervous system it\u2019s daytime, not nap time. If your schedule allows, a brisk 10\u2011minute walk in direct sunlight early in the day is practically free caffeine.\\n\\nEnvironment matters more than willpower: bright overhead lighting, cool room temperature, and a dedicated desk instead of the bed all signal \u201cawake\u201d to your body. Keep meals balanced and not carb\u2011heavy right before a study block; a big bowl of pasta followed by quiet reading is an invitation to nod off.\\n\\nFinally, a cup of coffee or green tea before your first session is not cheating\u2014the goal is productive focus, not suffering. If, after dialing in sleep, light, movement, and nutrition, you\u2019re still dozing off, get a quick blood test for iron, B\u201112, and thyroid just to rule out medical causes.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to white\u2011knuckle it.

Your brain\u2019s used to a certain level of background stimulation (like music), and when you remove it, things can feel dull or even make you sleepy. A couple of things might help: First, try adjusting your sleep schedule to get closer to 8 hours if possible\u2014sometimes 6-7 just isn\u2019t enough, especially if you\u2019re pushing your brain hard. Second, experiment with your study environment: natural light, sitting upright, and maybe even standing while working can help keep you alert. Short, regular breaks (like the Pomodoro technique) can also prevent that sluggish feeling. If you find music really helps, consider using instrumental or ambient tracks with no lyrics\u2014some people find these less distracting but still stimulating enough to keep them awake. Lastly, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you need to tweak your detox rules a bit; discipline is about finding what actually works for you, not just following a strict set of rules.

Luckily you can retrain it the same way it got wired in the first place: by pairing work with small, deliberate wins and making the cheap thrills a bit harder to reach.\\n\\nFirst, put speed bumps between you and the mind\u2011numbing stuff. If you need the web to study, use a browser profile or extension that only lets you access the sites you actually need. Everything else gets blocked during work blocks. If you work on your phone, delete or offload the apps that eat your time and make them something you have to re\u2011download. The tiny hassle is enough to remind you, \u201cI chose to focus.\u201d\\n\\nSecond, shrink the size of \u201cwork.\u201d If your brain is used to instant gratification, a two\u2011hour study session feels like eternity. Try a 20\u2011minute timer (Pomodoro). Promise yourself you can do whatever you want for five minutes when it rings. When the break comes, stand up, stretch, maybe grab water, but avoid the high\u2011dopamine traps\u2014no infinite scroll. You\u2019re rewarding yourself with relief, not with another dopamine firehose. After a few cycles your brain starts to expect that the next reward comes from finishing the next 20 minutes, not from bailing early.\\n\\nThird, make the reward for good days visible. Keep a log\u2014paper is best\u2014where you mark every study block you complete. It sounds trivial, but watching the chain grow day by day satisfies the same \u201cinstant reward\u201d urge while reinforcing the long\u2011term goal. If you want an extra nudge, set a weekly tally: hit, say, ten blocks and you earn a movie night or some other treat that\u2019s still fun but not addictive.\\n\\nFinally, remember that cravings come in waves. When the urge to open YouTube hits, tell yourself you can do it in ten minutes. Most urges fade if you sit with them for even two. Stack enough of these small victories and the default eventually flips: working becomes the easier choice, distractions feel like detours, and the instant gratification you crave comes from seeing yourself stick to the plan.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, this is super common, especially with how easy it is to get quick hits of dopamine from our phones and the internet. One thing that helps is to make the \\"default\\" option less tempting\u2014try putting your phone in another room or using apps that block distracting sites while you work. Since you need your devices for studying, maybe set up a separate browser profile or workspace just for work, so it feels different from your \\"fun\\" mode. Also, instead of trying to eliminate the desire for instant gratification, you can use it to your advantage: set up small, healthy rewards for finishing tasks, like a 5-minute break or a snack after 25 minutes of focused work (the Pomodoro technique is great for this). Over time, your brain starts to associate getting things done with feeling good, not just mindless scrolling.

I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off.

I\'m an engineer now. It\'s possible for you as well, learn about passing the GED as an exam instead of trying to learn what\'s on it (the big books the give you are intimidating), being in college is rewarding as you are around people motivated to learn. Community college will be a better resource at first until you are ready to transfer to a university.","comment_o3":"You\u2019re not too far gone at all\u201424 is a perfectly normal age to be figuring this out and people ten, twenty, even thirty years older than you do it every year. The short version of the process is: get the GED, use it to enroll in community college, then transfer or continue from there.  \\n\\nFirst step: make an account on GED.com. That site is run by the company that administers the test, and it walks you through registration, state\u2011specific rules, testing centers, fees, and free practice questions. Take the diagnostic quizzes right away; they\u2019ll show where you\u2019re strong and where you need work, which keeps your study time focused instead of random.  \\n\\nNext, call or email the nearest community college\u2019s \u201cadult education\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d department. Almost every state funds free or very low\u2011cost GED prep classes\u2014many meet at night or online and include tutors. If you suspect a learning disability, tell them; the GED has official accommodations (extra time, private room, etc.) and colleges often have disability services that can help you document and receive them.  \\n\\nNow the discipline piece: treat studying like a shift at work. Pick a specific block of time you can defend\u2014say 7\u20139\xa0p.m. on weeknights\u2014and sit in the same spot with your phone on airplane mode until the block is over. Start each session by writing the single topic you\u2019ll cover (e.g., \u201cfractions\u201d or \u201csocial studies practice test\u201d) at the top of a sheet of paper and end by jotting what to tackle tomorrow, so you never waste time wondering what\u2019s next. Khan Academy, GED Flash, and plenty of YouTube channels cover everything for free; the key is consistency, not perfect resources. Aim for four or five study blocks a week and track them on a calendar so you can see the streak grow.  \\n\\nOnce your GED practice scores are comfortably above passing, schedule the real exams one at a time. Passing all four subjects instantly makes you eligible for federal financial aid; fill out the FAFSA as soon as it opens in October and apply to the community college for Spring 2024 admission. They\u2019ll likely give you a placement test and, if needed, remedial math or English courses\u2014which is normal and nothing to be embarrassed about.  \\n\\nThe plan is straightforward: GED account tonight, call the adult\u2011ed office tomorrow, study on a fixed schedule, knock out the four exams, file FAFSA, enroll. Keep your daily study habit small but non\u2011negotiable, and the months between now and spring will be more than enough.

You got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"You\u2019re definitely not too far gone, and honestly, you\u2019re not alone\u2014lots of people have gaps in their education for all kinds of reasons.

First, look up GED prep programs in your area\u2014public libraries, community colleges, and adult education centers often offer free or low-cost classes. There are also online resources (like Khan Academy, GED.com, and YouTube channels) that can help you brush up on the basics at your own pace. Once you feel ready, you can register for the GED test through GED.com, which will guide you to official testing centers near you. As for discipline, try setting a simple daily study routine, even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes a day to start. Track your progress and celebrate small wins\u2014consistency is way more important than cramming. If you hit a wall, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help\u2014there are tons of online forums and local tutors who can support you.

I searched for jobs at all the CVS\'s and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I\'m *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\\n\\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who\'s the only bread winner violated me.

(Does that actually work?)\\n\\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I\'m not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I\'m not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing\'s different. I can\'t find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I\'d end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \\"career\\" when I don\'t want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\\n\\nI forgot to mention, I can\'t drive either. No money for classes. I\'m just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.","comments":{"best_comment":"First thing\'s first. Don\'t panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \\n\\n\\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \\n\\n\\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don\'t know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \\"!?!\\" Most people don\'t have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don\'t really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \\n\\n\\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \\n\\n\\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don\'t interest you and that you don\'t like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \\n\\n\\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \\n\\n\\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \\n\\n\\nIf you don\'t get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don\'t have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can\'t do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don\'t care what it is; don\'t let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don\'t want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \\n\\n\\n3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don\'t like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \\n\\n\\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \\n\\n\\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \\n\\n\\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \\n\\n\\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn\'t super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.","percentile_10_comment":"Check out www.selfauthoring.com They offer a series of writing exercises designed by clinical psychologists aimed at helping people to clarify a long term vision for their lives.

Fast\u2011food chains, warehouses, call centers, grocery stores\u2014any place with high turnover will at least give you an interview if you keep showing up. After each application, phone the store a few days later to ask if they\u2019ve reviewed it; managers remember the name that calls back.\\n\\nWhile you\u2019re applying, start a free online certificate that looks decent on an entry\u2011level r\xe9sum\xe9.

Consistency matters more than motivation; set a timer, finish the hour, then stand up and move on. Doing it daily trains you to keep commitments even when the excitement fades, which is exactly the muscle you\u2019ve been missing.\\n\\nFor money to leave home later, you\u2019ll want a cheap living situation before college.

Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I\'m a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life.

Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don\'t feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.\\n\\nI stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\\n\\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\\n\\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I\'m home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn\'t do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\\n\\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week\'s worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\\n\\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven\'t or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don\'t do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\\n\\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don\'t work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\\n\\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I\'m typically just a lazy slug.","comments":{"best_comment":"What you need are two things:\\n\\n1) A mentor. \\n\\nAnyone who you can trust that can support you and help you to develop the skills you need to be able to be more productive and achieve your goals.

They are easy to start and over time, become engrained into your daily ritual to the point of subconsciousness. \\n\\nBreak the mindset that your path to success is A to B. It\'s really A to Z. Start small. Start with easy changes that do not require a lot of effort or change who you are overnight. Build from there. Find the inner developmental triggers that work for you by expirimenting and learning about who you are as an individual.

If you can, put your phone in another room or use apps that block certain sites for a set time. You don\u2019t have to go cold turkey, but even 30 minutes of focused work is better than none.

Also, make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep, eating decently, and moving your body a bit\u2014basic stuff, but it makes a huge difference.

Give every hour a job, even if the job is \u201cscroll Reddit\u201d or \u201cstare at the ceiling.\u201d Paradoxically, writing it down makes you notice how much free time you actually have and where procrastination sneaks in. If you blow the schedule, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just reschedule the task for later in the day or tomorrow. Treat it like moving an appointment, not a moral failure.\\n\\nTrack progress visibly. A wall calendar with X\u2019s, a habit\u2011tracking app, or a simple spreadsheet turns vague effort into hard data. Your brain likes seeing streaks grow; it\u2019s a built\u2011in dopamine hit that replaces the anxious loop you\u2019re stuck in now.\\n\\nLimit your inputs. If you\u2019re constantly doom\u2011scrolling, binging shows, or comparing yourself on social media, you\u2019ll feel empty because you\u2019re downloading everyone else\u2019s agenda. Set a timer or use website blockers so these activities fit into defined slots instead of bleeding into everything.\\n\\nMove your body daily, even if it\u2019s just push\u2011ups during commercial breaks. Exercise is the single fastest legal way to boost mood, reduce anxiety, and sharpen focus. You don\u2019t need a gym membership\u2014YouTube and a floor space work fine.\\n\\nIf negative self\u2011talk keeps hijacking you, get it out of your head. Journal for ten minutes each morning, dumping every fear and doubt onto paper. Seeing thoughts in black and white makes them easier to question. If the anxiety feels unmanageable, talk to a counselor; mental health is a skill set, not a character flaw.\\n\\nGive this process at least 90 days before judging it. Discipline feels boring at first because you\u2019re rewiring habits, not chasing dopamine. After a few weeks the routines become automatic and the sense of control returns. Future\u2011you will thank present\u2011you for choosing small, consistent wins over dramatic but unsustainable bursts.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, a lot of people feel stuck at some point, especially if they didn\u2019t have much guidance growing up. The good news is you don\u2019t need to go from zero to 100 overnight. Start by picking one small thing you can control each day\u2014like making your bed, going for a 10-minute walk, or setting a timer to do something productive for just 5 minutes. The point isn\u2019t to overhaul your life instantly, but to build trust with yourself through tiny wins. Over time, these small actions add up and help rebuild your confidence. Also, try not to compare your progress to others; focus on your own lane. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay to ask for help or talk to someone you trust. The most important thing is to keep moving, even if it\u2019s just a little bit at a time.

Are you bored? Is it emotional eating? Scarcity mindset? Body image problem? Eating disorder? Depression/anxiety?\\n\\nYou can\'t fix the problem until you know what it is. Eating is just the symptom.","percentile_10_comment":" A someone who struggled with dissorderd eating, imposing more restrictions when you are already (physically OR mentally) restricting WONT help your cause. For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.\\n\\nWhen you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\\n\\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \\"unhealthy\\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\\n\\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot \\"fail\\" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. \\n\\nBtw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.\\n\\nI know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.\\n\\nF the bikini body, your happiness is more important. Treat the issue (could be anything, you gotta figure it out on your own), not the symptom (overeating).","comment_o3":"A few things that helped me shrink my intake without feeling miserable. First, make the decision at the grocery store, not in the kitchen. If the only snacks in the house are things you don\u2019t mind eating in bigger quantities\u2014baby carrots, pickles, air\u2011popped popcorn\u2014it\u2019s hard to blow up your calories no matter how bored you feel. Leftovers are trickier, but you can pre\u2011portion them into single\u2011serve containers and freeze anything beyond tomorrow\u2019s meals. The extra step of thawing adds just enough friction to let the craving pass.\\n\\nSecond, schedule your eating the same way you\u2019d schedule workouts. Pick a simple rule like \u201cI eat at 10, 2 and 7\u201d or an 8\u2011hour eating window. Outside those times, the kitchen is closed. If you\u2019re genuinely hungry, drink a full glass of water, wait fifteen minutes, then reassess; half the time the urge disappears because it was thirst or boredom masquerading as hunger.\\n\\nThird, give your brain an automatic alternative for boredom. Make a two\u2011minute move rule: whenever you catch yourself wandering toward the fridge, you have to do something active for two minutes first\u2014push\u2011ups, a walk around the block, tidying a drawer. After the two minutes you can still eat if you want, but the pause breaks the habit loop and often fulfills the need for stimulation that was driving you there in the first place.\\n\\nFinally, track what you do, not just what you hope to do. Log everything in an app like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal, even the handful of chips. Seeing the numbers stack up in real time builds awareness and makes the gap between 2500 and 1700 obvious and actionable. If you miss your target, don\u2019t spiral; look at the log, find the 300\u2011calorie item that pushed you over, and plan one concrete change for tomorrow. String a few of those days together and the new intake level becomes the default rather than a constant fight.","comment_gpt4dot1":"One thing that helps a lot with resisting cravings is changing your environment. If you have leftovers or snacks in easy reach, try putting them out of sight or in harder-to-access places. When you get the urge to eat out of boredom, try to pause for a minute and do something else\u2014like going for a quick walk, drinking a glass of water, or even brushing your teeth (weirdly effective). Tracking what you eat can also make you more aware of your habits and help you stick closer to your calorie goals. It\u2019s not about being perfect every day, but building up small wins and making it a little harder to mindlessly snack. Over time, those small changes add up.

This problem made me not think about all the things above, which I basically stopped.\\nNext week I will probably go again at my parents home because uni will finish for this period and so I will have 3/4 months in which I don\u2019t have any idea about what to do, which can help me for the future / self-improvement while providing fun.

Before you go home, grab a notebook and map out three things: one health habit, one skill habit, and one \u201cjust\u2011for\u2011fun\u201d habit. Health can be as simple as a push\u2011pull\u2011legs routine with resistance bands or bodyweight plus a daily 30\u2011minute walk; skill could be finishing an online course that pairs with your degree or a certification that bumps your r\xe9sum\xe9; fun might be something you\u2019ve always wanted to try\u2014guitar, a language, drawing. Give each habit a time slot on your calendar and protect it the same way you would protect a lecture or an exam. When you\u2019re back home, announce your plan to your parents so the household schedule supports, rather than derails, you.\\n\\nYou slipped because you relied on motivation instead of systems. Build guardrails this time. Lay out tomorrow\u2019s workout clothes before bed, set a site\u2011blocker that locks out social media or dating apps until after your skill session, and keep weed out of the house entirely; if that\u2019s impossible, commit to a once\u2011a\u2011week limit and log usage in a tracker. That small bit of friction makes a huge difference.\\n\\nSince you still have the \u201cneed to compete\u201d itch, channel it into measurable streaks. Use a habit\u2011tracking app or a wall calendar and don\u2019t break the chain. Hit 30 consecutive days of workouts or language practice and post the screenshot somewhere visible. Seeing the streak climb gives you the same dopamine hit that swiping on dating apps used to provide, minus the chaos.\\n\\nMoney and experience worries are valid. Even if local employers aren\u2019t hiring, you can still freelance online, tutor high\u2011school kids in subjects you\u2019re already passing at university, or do volunteer remote work that fills your CV and lets you practice discipline on real tasks with deadlines. Set a weekly quota of hours, exactly like a part\u2011time job.\\n\\nFinally, schedule a full medical checkup to close the loop on the health scare; peace of mind keeps you from slipping back into frantic behavior. Then accept that relapse is normal\u2014what matters is shortening the gap between falling off and getting back on. Every day you follow the plan is a vote for the disciplined person you\u2019re becoming.

I do not respect myself and lack confidence and even if I come forward to talk about my struggles with a friend they never take me serious and ALWAYS misunderstand me.","comments":{"best_comment":"Try maybe very small.

Rather than setting up end goals try to break down all the task into bits and pieces. What I\'m trying to say is have every step clear in your mind, strategize everything like it\'s a war you must win. Maybe write things down, every detail about how you are gonna study. How you are gonna tackle every part, be extremely practical and know your limits. Don\'t put too much expectations and stop planning out things roughly. Being specific will bring more clarity. As you start being productive into studying you can now slowly start adding workouts into your routine. When one thing is sorted and you feel productive other things would get back on track on their own.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve crawled out of a very similar hole and the pattern that finally worked was to shrink the promises until they were impossible to dodge, then stack them up. Tomorrow, don\u2019t promise a full study session or a gym comeback. Promise yourself you\u2019ll open the textbook and read one page. When that\u2019s done, let yourself quit if you want. The point isn\u2019t the page; it\u2019s proving to your brain that you do what you say you\u2019ll do. Once that single\u2011page habit is automatic, raise it to five pages, then a Pomodoro, and so on.  \\n\\nEnvironment matters more than willpower, so rig it. Leave the apartment with nothing but your study materials and a bottle of water\u2014library, campus lounge, anywhere without your console or YouTube algorithm. If you have to stay home, install website blockers that launch automatically during your planned study window and keep your phone in another room. The friction of retrieving it gives you a few crucial seconds to remember the promise you made to yourself.  \\n\\nPorn and gaming aren\u2019t evil, but right now they\u2019re crowding out what you say you want. Put a speed bump in front of each: uninstall the games until the exam is over, and use an app like Blocksite or Cold Turkey on the big porn domains. If the urge hits, do ten push\u2011ups or walk around the block before deciding whether to give in. Half the time the urge passes; the other half you still get a micro\u2011workout.  \\n\\nPhysical momentum helps mental momentum. You don\u2019t need a 90\u2011minute lifting session\u2014go outside and jog for five minutes or do a single set of push\u2011ups every morning. Consistency trumps volume. Your confidence will follow repeated evidence that you can keep a streak alive, no matter how tiny the daily action is.  \\n\\nLastly, get outside accountability. Post your daily study target in a group chat, join a Discord study room, or text a friend a selfie with your open notebook each day. You don\u2019t need them to \u201cget\u201d your struggle; you just need a witness.  \\n\\nYour rut isn\u2019t evidence that you\u2019re broken; it\u2019s just a set of grooves you\u2019ve slid into by repetition.

The point is to lower the bar so much that it\u2019s almost impossible to fail.

Prep two grab\u2011and\u2011go meals on Sunday night\u2014chicken wraps, overnight oats, whatever you\u2019ll actually eat\u2014and keep them in the fridge so \u201ceat something decent\u201d becomes easier than UberEats. Book gym sessions with a friend or sign up for a class; social accountability is rocket fuel compared to solo plans.\\n\\nEvery Sunday evening do a 15\u2011minute weekly review: what worked, what bombed, what gets scheduled next week. Expect the system to break; the review is where you patch leaks instead of labelling yourself \u201cundisciplined.\u201d\\n\\nFinally, treat slips as data, not verdicts. ADHD management is an engineering problem\u2014test, measure, tweak. Keep the anchor habit, keep showing up at the library, keep resetting every Sunday, and the rest will stack itself around those pillars more often than not.

Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, huge respect for your self-awareness and for taking steps to get help\u2014that\u2019s not easy, especially when you\u2019re feeling lost. University is a massive shift, especially when you go from a super-structured environment to one where you have to build your own routines from scratch. It\u2019s totally normal to struggle with that, and honestly, a lot of people do, even if they don\u2019t talk about it.\\n\\nNow that you know about your ADHD, you can start working with your brain instead of against it. Structure doesn\u2019t have to be rigid or overwhelming. Start small: pick one or two \u201canchor\u201d habits that you do every day, no matter what. For example, waking up at the same time, or having a set time for breakfast or a walk. These little routines can help your days feel less chaotic and give you a sense of control.\\n\\nFor academics, try using timers (like the Pomodoro technique\u201425 minutes on, 5 minutes off) to break tasks into manageable chunks. It can also help to set up your environment so it\u2019s easier to do the things you want to do\u2014like laying out your clothes the night before, or keeping your study materials in one spot.\\n\\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of sunlight and movement, even if it\u2019s just a 10-minute walk outside. It can make a big difference, especially in the UK winter. And if you slip up, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just try to get back to your anchors as soon as you can.\\n\\nLastly, keep leaning on the support you\u2019ve built\u2014counselling, friends, gym, therapy. You\u2019re already doing a lot right, and it\u2019s okay if progress isn\u2019t linear. You\u2019re not lazy or broken, you\u2019re just figuring out what works for you.

Soo  It\'s where you create a list of all the things/situations/etc that gives you anxiety and you group them up based on if you can do something about it or nah. After grouping, dedicate time and effort to things which you can change while learning to accept the things you can\'t.","comment_o3":"You\u2019re bouncing between two extremes: endless cheap dopamine from screens and a flood of anxiety when they\u2019re gone. The middle ground is giving your brain something mildly engaging yet productive while you build tolerance for a bit of discomfort. Try this: set a 10\u2011minute timer, put the phone out of reach, and do a low\u2011stakes task\u2014wash dishes, stretch, journal, tidy one shelf. When the timer ends, you\u2019re free to check the phone if you want. Repeat a few times a day and slowly lengthen the off\u2011screen blocks. Your brain learns that boredom isn\u2019t an emergency.\\n\\nNext, corral the worry. Schedule a daily \u201canxiety slot\u201d of about ten minutes. Sit with a notebook and write every anxious thought that pops up. When the timer ends, close the book and remind yourself worrying is done until the next slot. Containing it like this keeps it from bleeding into everything else.\\n\\nAdd a quick physical reset whenever you feel the spiral starting\u2014take a brisk walk, do twenty jumping jacks, or try box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4). Movement burns off stress hormones and gives you a healthier dopamine bump.\\n\\nFinally, choose one tiny habit that aligns with who you want to become\u2014read two pages, do five push\u2011ups, practice a language for one minute. Make it so small you can\u2019t say no. Each time you do it, mentally note, \u201cI kept a promise to myself.\u201d That\u2019s the sustainable dopamine hit you\u2019re after. If anxiety still feels unmanageable, consider talking to a professional\u2014no shame in using every tool. You\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, this is a super common struggle, especially with how easy it is to get quick dopamine from devices. The key is to find activities that aren\u2019t just mindless scrolling but also aren\u2019t so intense that they trigger anxiety. Stuff like going for a walk, doing a simple chore, or even doodling can be a good middle ground\u2014they keep your hands and mind busy without being overwhelming. Over time, you can build up your tolerance for \u201cboredom\u201d and anxious thoughts by gradually spending a little more time away from the dopamine hits. It\u2019s not about quitting cold turkey, but slowly training your brain to be okay with less stimulation. Also, if anxiety is really getting in the way, it might help to try some basic mindfulness or breathing exercises when you notice it creeping in.

How to avoid it?","body":"I have a 9-5 job and I am disciplined during my weekdays. I always think about completely my pending and important tasks during the weekends. However, when weekends actually arrive, I tend to lose my daily routine. I watch porn a lot till late night on Friday and wakeup late the next Saturday. I also tend to sleep on my bed the weekends without doing my chores. I feel I tend to be more productive during my weekdays even though I have less time compared to my weekends. Hanging out with friends to late night during the weekends is also another reason why my sleep cycle is disturbed.","comments":{"best_comment":"One thing you might experiment with is taking one day completely off to rest, and the other day schedule something for 9 or 10am outside of the house, like a breakfast with a friend, so you have to get up and get ready for the day. This will also motivate you to not stay up too late the night before.","percentile_10_comment":"Why not put \'hang out with friends\' and \'watch porn\' on your schedule? The time spent doing those things is obviously pleasurable to you, otherwise you wouldn\'t do them. If those activities in some way contribute to helping you recharge from your week, why not see them as valuable? Then you are removing the feeling that that time is \'wasted\'. Your life isn\'t lacking discipline at the weekend, it\'s just that you do different things at the weekend and haven\'t accounted for them in your schedule.","comment_o3":"The easiest way to keep the weekends from melting into chaos is to stop treating them as completely different animals from your weekdays. Pick a wake\u2011up time that\u2019s only an hour later than your normal workday and stick to it both Saturday and Sunday. Once you\u2019re up, run through the same short morning routine you use Monday\u2013Friday\u2014shower, quick breakfast, maybe ten minutes of stretching or reading\u2014anything familiar that signals, \u201cday has started.\u201d That single anchor keeps the rest of your schedule from drifting.\\n\\nBefore you log off work on Friday, write out the three specific things you most want done by Sunday night. Make them concrete (\u201claunder and fold two loads,\u201d \u201cdraft budget in spreadsheet,\u201d \u201ccall parents\u201d) and slap a time next to each. If the list lives in your head, it\u2019s a wish; on paper with times, it\u2019s an appointment. You can still hang with friends, but plan around those commitments instead of hoping motivation shows up.\\n\\nAbout the porn/late\u2011night scroll: set a device cutoff\u2014say 11\xa0p.m.\u2014and move your phone or laptop to another room after that. Combine it with an \u201coffline wind\u2011down\u201d ritual like reading a paperback in bed. If willpower feels flimsy, install a blocker app (BlockSite, Cold Turkey, whatever) that locks adult sites after your cutoff. Removing friction beats wrestling with temptation at 1\xa0a.m.\\n\\nFinally, give future\u2011you a reward that depends on finishing the must\u2011dos. For example, no new Netflix series until your three tasks are ticked off. That tiny bit of leverage turns chores into tickets to the fun stuff rather than obstacles.\\n\\nWeekends don\u2019t need minute\u2011by\u2011minute scheduling, but a consistent wake time, a short morning routine, and three pre\u2011planned tasks will keep them from derailing your sleep cycle\u2014and your discipline.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Weekends can definitely throw off routines, especially when there\u2019s suddenly a lot more freedom and less structure. One thing that helps is to actually plan your weekends almost like you do your weekdays, but with more flexibility. Try setting a few non-negotiable anchor points\u2014like a consistent wake-up time, a set time for chores, or a workout. You don\u2019t have to schedule every hour, but having a couple of fixed activities can keep you from drifting too far off track. Also, if you notice certain habits (like staying up late watching porn or scrolling) are making it harder to stick to your goals, consider swapping them out for something else you enjoy but that doesn\u2019t mess with your sleep or motivation\u2014maybe a movie, reading, or hanging out with friends earlier in the evening.

Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic.

Everything else\u2014perfect grades, weight loss, job hunting\u2014can wait until those three habits feel automatic. To make that happen, build one micro\u2011routine: pick a bedtime and an alarm, leave your phone across the room, and set a 10\u2011minute \u201cwind\u2011down\u201d timer.

The stomach cares more about volume, water and fiber than calories. Start every meal with a big glass of water and a bulky, low\u2011cost, high\u2011fiber food\u2014frozen veggies microwaved with salt, air\u2011popped popcorn, a chopped apple, or a bowl of oats. That puts literal bulk in your gut so the rest of the meal feels like enough. Next, make sure each plate has a solid protein source\u2014eggs, canned tuna, beans, lentils. Protein blunts hunger signals way longer than carbs or fat and those items are dirt cheap per gram. Third, slow your eating way down. Set the fork down between bites, chew until the food is basically mush, and take at least 15\u201120 minutes to finish.

A few things that might help: try to make sure your meals have a good amount of protein and fiber, since both help you feel fuller for longer. Stuff like beans, lentils, eggs, oats, and veggies are usually pretty cheap and filling. Drinking a big glass of water before and during your meal can also help with satiety. Eating slower and really focusing on your food (instead of eating while distracted) can make a difference too, since it gives your body time to register fullness. If you\u2019re still hungry after a meal, sometimes a hot drink like tea can help take the edge off. It might take a bit for your body to adjust, but with some consistency, your appetite should start to match your new routine.

What finally broke the loop was accepting that willpower in the first 30 seconds after waking is almost nonexistent, so I had to redesign the environment instead of \u201ctrying harder.\u201d Put the loud alarm somewhere that physically forces you to leave your bedroom to turn it off\u2014at the other end of the hall, the bathroom sink, even outside your door. If you\u2019re able to kill alarms and crawl back into bed, the alarm is still too close. Next, plant a trigger that makes going back to bed uncomfortable or impossible. I taped a handwritten note to the alarm that said, \u201cShoes on, door out, library.\u201d Right next to it were my shoes and a filled water bottle. Once I turned the alarm off, the next easiest step was to put on the shoes and walk out.\\n\\nAttach an immediate obligation to the early hour, the way your old job did. Meet a friend at the library or a caf\xe9 when they open, join an online study group that starts with a quick video check\u2011in, or schedule a short call with a tutor. The key is that someone will notice if you don\u2019t show. Fear of letting others down works just as well as fear of a boss.\\n\\nMake the first study block ridiculously small\u2014say, five quick practice questions or ten minutes of flashcards. Finishing it creates a win and shifts your brain out of sleep mode. After that, start your normal schedule. If you\u2019re still groggy, expose yourself to bright light (sunlight if possible, or a cheap 10,000\u2011lux lamp) and sip cold water or coffee while you work.\\n\\nFinally, track only one metric for the next month: \u201cDid I stay out of bed after the alarm?\u201d Put a checkmark on a wall calendar each day you succeed. Forget perfect study hours for now; consistency with wake\u2011up is the foundation all the other habits will sit on. Miss a day, immediately recommit and aim for a streak of one. Keeping the focus that narrow prevents the self\u2011loathing spiral and gives you a clear scoreboard.\\n\\nRedesign the environment, add external accountability, and lower the bar for what counts as \u201cstarting.\u201d Do those three and the mornings stop being a willpower battle and start running on autopilot again. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve beaten early wake\u2011ups before, you can wire the same reflex back in for exam prep.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, you\u2019re not alone\u2014so many people struggle with this, especially when the external pressure (like a job or boss) is gone. The alarms and apps are clever, but it sounds like your brain is just too good at finding ways around them. Instead of fighting yourself every morning, try changing your environment and routine so it\u2019s harder to fall back asleep. For example, put your alarm or phone across the room, so you have to physically get up to turn it off. Once you\u2019re up, immediately do something that requires movement and light\u2014open a window, splash cold water on your face, or even step outside for a minute. You could also set up a \u201cmorning accountability\u201d system: text a friend or post in a group chat as soon as you\u2019re up, or schedule a quick call with someone who\u2019s also trying to wake up early. Another thing that helps is having a small, enjoyable task to look forward to in the morning (like a favorite breakfast or a few minutes of a show/podcast) before you start studying. Finally, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014self-criticism just makes it harder to change. Focus on making it a little easier to get up each day, and celebrate small wins.

But sometimes it\u2019s just so hard to ignore some cravings for unhealthy food and that frustrates me.\\n\\nBut aside from dieting, I also want to start working out since I know physical activity is really important in losing weight and improving your health. I have a spin bike and a treadmill at home that I use, but sometimes I get lazy and lose the will to move so I feel like I need some external motivation, that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of going to the gym. However, the mere thought of going there makes me anxious and conscious because of how I look. I need some advice guys. Thank you very much.","comments":{"best_comment":"If you have issues with binging or your eating habits in general, you can go to a therapist for that for some help. Also, I understand that you feel self-conscious about going to the gym, and that\u2019s what I felt too. If you\u2019re really not comfortable with going to one, you can try getting a remote personal trainer from platforms like [Outright Fitness](https://outrightfitness.com/remote-training/) or [CoPilot](https://mycopilot.com/?r=1). You can start with that first until you\u2019re finally comfortable and confident enough to go and workout in a gym. Just take your time and don\u2019t pressure yourself.","percentile_10_comment":"Which is worse, your health scare or maybe someone judging you?\\n\\nPut your earphones in, and take care of you. People there will be less judgmental than you think, they are usually glad to see you take the initiative and take control of your problems.","comment_o3":"A trick that helped me get over \u201cgym stage\u2011fright\u201d was to treat the place like any other piece of equipment I\u2019ve paid for access to: I walk in, do the work I planned, walk out. Most people are too busy counting their own reps or worrying about their playlists to judge anyone else\u2019s body, and the few who do aren\u2019t worth your attention. If that thought alone isn\u2019t enough, try going during off\u2011peak hours (late morning, mid\u2011afternoon, or late evening) when the floor is half empty\u2014you\u2019ll get used to the layout and the etiquette without feeling on display, and by the time it\u2019s busier you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re doing. Before you set foot in the door, pick a simple routine that tells you exactly which three or four lifts or machines you\u2019ll hit and in what order. Decision fatigue kills motivation; a clear plan lets you move with purpose, finish in 45 minutes, and leave with a win.\\n\\nAt home, keep the momentum going by lowering the bar for \u201csuccess.\u201d Promise yourself just five easy minutes on the treadmill; once you\u2019re moving it usually snowballs into a full session, and even if it doesn\u2019t you kept the habit alive. Pair those five minutes with something you already enjoy\u2014put on a specific podcast you only let yourself hear while walking, for example\u2014so the brain starts linking exercise with a tiny reward.\\n\\nCravings are normal and don\u2019t have to be an enemy. Pre\u2011decide when and what you\u2019ll indulge in; it stops the internal debate in the moment. A planned slice of pizza on Saturday night feels way better than stress\u2011eating three slices on a random Tuesday. The rest of the time, make the good choice the easy choice: stock fruit that you actually like, keep water or diet soda visibly in reach, and hide or don\u2019t buy the junk that tends to ambush you.\\n\\nFinally, remember you\u2019re not in competition with the ripped guy deadlifting five plates. Your only job today is to be a little more active and consistent than yesterday. Show up, check the box, move on. Stack enough of those boring, almost\u2011too\u2011easy days together and the confidence (and the results) show up whether you feel like it or not. You\u2019ve already started with the diet change\u2014keep using that same mindset on the exercise front and you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly the anxiety fades.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, props to you for making changes and sticking with your diet, even when it\u2019s tough. That\u2019s already a big step. About the gym anxiety\u2014honestly, most people are way too focused on their own workouts to pay attention to anyone else. But if it still feels overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to force yourself to go all-in right away. Maybe start by going during off-peak hours when it\u2019s quieter, or just go for a short visit to get used to the environment without any pressure to do a full workout. You could even bring a friend if that helps.\\n\\nAlso, don\u2019t underestimate the value of what you can do at home. Consistency matters more than where you work out. If motivation is the issue, try setting a specific time each day for your spin bike or treadmill, and treat it like a non-negotiable appointment. Some people find it helps to lay out their workout clothes the night before or to put on a playlist or podcast they only listen to while exercising.\\n\\nCravings are normal, and slipping up sometimes doesn\u2019t erase your progress. The key is to get back on track without beating yourself up. Building discipline is about showing up for yourself, even when it\u2019s not perfect. You\u2019re already on the right path\u2014just keep taking small steps, and it\u2019ll get easier over time."}},{"id":"t3_y3ddnb","title":"[Need Advice] Tips on developing thicker skin for criticism?","body":"I\u2019m an incredibly thin-skinned person when it comes to any sort of criticism.

Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much everything. Don\u2019t take yourself so seriously.","comment_o3":"A trick that helped me was to start thinking of criticism the way a pro athlete thinks of game tape: it\u2019s just information you can use to improve. When someone points out a flaw, write it down verbatim in a notebook labeled \u201cdata,\u201d not \u201cjudgments.\u201d Once a week, read the notebook like an engineer reviewing test results\u2014calmly, with the goal of finding patterns you can fix. Separating the content from the sting trains your brain to see feedback as neutral input instead of a verdict on your worth.\\n\\nNext, build up calluses through deliberate exposure. Ask a friend, TA, or coworker for one specific piece of feedback on something low\u2011stakes\u2014your slide deck, your posture, whatever\u2014then thank them and walk away before you can explain or defend yourself. That short, controlled rep teaches your nervous system that criticism isn\u2019t lethal. Do it a couple of times a week and the initial spike of defensiveness starts to fade.\\n\\nAdd a \u201c24\u2011hour rule\u201d before reacting internally. The moment you get criticized, tell yourself, \u201cInteresting. I\u2019ll decide what to do with this tomorrow.\u201d Sleep on it, then assess whether the comment is actionable, partly useful, or trash to discard. That pause keeps a random remark from hijacking your whole day.\\n\\nFinally, shore up your own scoreboard. End each day by jotting down two things you did well and one you want to refine. When your sense of progress comes from measurable effort, outside opinions\u2014good or bad\u2014lose some of their power because they\u2019re no longer the only mirror you\u2019re looking into.\\n\\nKeep running the reps and it stops feeling like dodging blows and starts feeling like collecting upgrades. It won\u2019t be overnight, but consistency here is all you need to build thicker skin.","comment_gpt4dot1":"One thing that helps is to reframe criticism as information, not a personal attack. Most of the time, criticism is about a specific action or result, not your entire character. When you get feedback, try to pause before reacting\u2014literally take a breath and ask yourself, \u201cIs there something useful here, even if it stings?\u201d Over time, you can train yourself to see criticism as a tool for growth rather than a threat. It also helps to remind yourself that everyone gets criticized, and it\u2019s impossible to please everyone. Building resilience is a skill, just like any other habit: start small, reflect on your reactions, and keep practicing. The more you expose yourself to feedback and handle it intentionally, the less power it\u2019ll have over your mood."}},{"id":"t3_135fnzo","title":"[Need Advice] I\'m addicted to eating especially junk food like chocolates","body":"If you saw my previous post, I have an update: I managed to reduce my rice portion but now I\'m addicted to eating junk food especially chocolates.

First, make it harder to get. Don\u2019t bring any junk into the house; if it\u2019s already there, toss it or give it away. When you actually have to leave home and buy a single bar, the friction alone will cut your intake. Second, set a budgeted allowance so you\u2019re not trying to quit by sheer willpower all day. For example, one fun\u2011size piece after dinner, logged in a calorie tracker, is allowed; anything outside that rule is a hard \u201cno.\u201d Now fill the gaps you\u2019ve opened: eat protein and fiber at every meal, keep fruit, Greek yogurt, or a square of very dark chocolate on hand, and drink water whenever a craving hits.

When it comes to junk food, especially chocolates, it helps to make your environment work for you. Try not to keep chocolates or other junk food at home or within easy reach. If you do buy them, get smaller packs instead of big ones, so you\u2019re less likely to binge. You could also set a rule for yourself, like only eating chocolate after a meal or on certain days, rather than whenever the craving hits. Swapping in healthier snacks (like fruit, yogurt, or nuts) can help satisfy cravings without derailing your progress. If you notice you\u2019re eating out of boredom or stress, try to catch yourself and do something else for a few minutes\u2014sometimes the urge passes.

When you get home, set a 5\u2011minute phone timer and pick up only the trash that\u2019s within arm\u2019s reach. Stop when the timer goes off even if that feels silly. Do the same thing tomorrow, maybe for dishes, maybe for laundry, but never more than 5 minutes until that feels automatic.

Keys on the hook \u2192 timer on. First coffee on a day off \u2192 strip and remake the bed before drinking it. You\u2019re already performing the cue, so the new behavior piggybacks instead of relying on willpower.\\n\\nLimit the mess at the source to reduce future work. Keep one trash bag hanging on a doorknob all week so you\u2019re never more than one step from tossing something. Eat off the same plate and mug, wash them immediately after use, stash the rest of your dishes in a box in the closet for now. Fewer items, fewer piles.\\n\\nUse \u201cbody\u2011doubling\u201d for accountability without a $150 therapy bill.

Sometimes one practical tool picked up in a group setting moves the needle more than another med adjustment.\\n\\nFinally, treat this like you would any work project. Scope it small, track progress (simple calendar X\u2019s are enough), and review weekly. You already know how to execute under a process\u2014you just need to clock in at home for a few minutes a day. Tiny, consistent wins will do more than one heroic weekend blitz every few months.

Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, try picking one tiny thing to do each day at home, even if it feels pointless at first. For example, just take out the trash, or just wash one plate. Don\u2019t aim for a perfectly clean apartment\u2014just a little better than yesterday. Over time, these small wins can help you build momentum and make things feel less overwhelming.

Pick a realistic hour you want to get up (say 9\xa0a.m.) and set multiple alarms far from the bed. No matter how little you slept, get out of bed at that time, expose your eyes to bright light immediately (sunlight or a 10\xa0k\u2011lux lamp), and move your body for a few minutes. The first day will be rough, the second a little less so, and by the third or fourth your body will crash earlier in the evening because it\u2019s short on sleep. Keep the wake\u2011up time identical for at least two weeks\u2014even weekends\u2014so your circadian clock can reset.\\n\\nAt night, give yourself a strict \u201cscreens off\u201d cutoff an hour before the earliest time you\u2019d be okay falling asleep. Use that hour for something boring and dim\u2011lit: paperback reading, light stretching, journaling. If you\u2019re still wide awake after twenty minutes in bed, get up, do a low\u2011stim activity until drowsy, then try again; lying there frustrated trains your brain to associate bed with wakefulness.\\n\\nADHD makes sleep hygiene harder because impulse control is already taxed, so make the path of least resistance the one you want. Put the phone in a different room, schedule Do\u2011Not\u2011Disturb, set up an automatic computer shutdown at a certain hour, and lay out morning clothes and a caffeine source the night before.\\n\\nAbout the lies: the cleanest exit is a brief truth. \u201cMy sleep schedule went off the rails during online classes; I\u2019m fixing it now.\u201d Most people will shrug and move on, which frees you from juggling stories and lets you use that brainpower for the actual reset.\\n\\nFinally, use accountability so the new rhythm sticks. Text a friend a selfie on your morning walk, book an early study group, or join a Discord where people post daily check\u2011ins. Consistent external pressure keeps ADHD brains on track until the habit feels normal again.\\n\\nGive it one solid month of identical wake\u2011ups and light exposure, and the 7\xa0a.m.\u201310\xa0a.m. bedtime will start to feel as weird as it should. You\u2019ve already pulled 24\u2011hour sleep marathons; that shows your body desperately wants the rest. Align it with the clock, keep it boringly consistent, and the energy (and honesty) will follow.

The lies and shame spiral are rough, but you can break out of it. First, try to stop beating yourself up for the current state of things; it\u2019s a tough combo of circumstances, not a personal failure. The most important thing is to add some structure back, even if it\u2019s artificial. Pick a \u201cwake up\u201d time that\u2019s earlier than now but not extreme\u2014like 1-2pm\u2014and stick to it for a week, no matter when you fall asleep. Use alarms, put your phone across the room, and get out of bed as soon as you wake up. Once that\u2019s consistent, gradually move it earlier by 30-60 minutes every few days. Also, get sunlight ASAP after waking, even if it\u2019s just standing by a window, and avoid screens for an hour before you want to sleep. If you can, schedule something small but non-negotiable in the morning (even a call with a friend or a daily walk). It\u2019ll take time, and you\u2019ll probably slip up, but consistency is more important than perfection. And if you haven\u2019t already, talk to your doctor about ADHD and sleep\u2014sometimes meds or therapy can help a ton.

I recommend unf*ck your habitat and the flylady for some simple routine building. \\nTo get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it\'s really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash?

The trick is to make those routines small enough that they never trigger the \u201cugh, this will take forever\u201d feeling that shuts you down.\\n\\nPick one \u201canchor\u201d moment you already do every single day\u2014getting back from work, brushing your teeth, brewing coffee, whatever. Right after that anchor, set a timer for ten minutes and tackle only one micro\u2011zone: the dishes in the sink, the clothes on the bedroom floor, or just the coffee table. When the timer dings, you\u2019re done. If you still have energy, great, keep going; if not, you\u2019ve still won the day. Ten minutes daily is seventy minutes a week, which is the equivalent of a full deep\u2011clean session without the misery of a deep\u2011clean session.\\n\\nSimplify the battlefield so each zone can actually be finished in those ten minutes. Put a hamper in the room where clothes collect, a trash bin where junk piles up, and a multipurpose spray plus rag in the kitchen and bathroom. Frictionless tools mean you don\u2019t \u201cgear up\u201d to clean\u2014you just grab and swipe.\\n\\nGive every object a parking spot. If you don\u2019t know where something lives, you won\u2019t put it away, so decide once and stick to it. Clothes go in the hamper or the closet, dishes go in the dishwasher or rack, mail goes in a tray, chargers in a drawer, and so on. Once those homes exist, tidying is just a matter of return\u2011to\u2011base, not decision\u2011making.\\n\\nSchedule one weekly reset\u2014Sunday afternoon works for a lot of people\u2014where you run laundry, empty trash cans, wipe bathroom surfaces, and vacuum. Because you\u2019ve been doing daily ten\u2011minute pickups, the weekly reset stays under an hour.\\n\\nPair the tasks with something pleasant. Blast a playlist, put on a podcast, or call a friend on speaker. That positive association makes tomorrow\u2019s ten\u2011minute timer feel less like punishment.\\n\\nFinally, track it visibly. A paper calendar on the fridge with a big X for each day you hit your ten\u2011minute session keeps momentum alive. One missed day is nothing; two in a row is a pattern\u2014use the calendar to catch yourself early.\\n\\nYou already have discipline for work, study, and hiking. Cleaning isn\u2019t a different skill; it\u2019s just a different routine. Shrink the tasks, anchor them to habits you already have, remove friction, and watch the piles disappear almost in the background.

A few things that help break that cycle:\\n\\nFirst, get a real evaluation for ADHD. If it turns out you do have it, medication and coaching can make an enormous difference. Even if you don\u2019t, the diagnostic process forces you to articulate what\u2019s happening, which can be clarifying in itself.\\n\\nWhile you wait on that, shrink your targets until they\u2019re laughably easy. Tell yourself you\u2019re studying for five minutes, then you can quit. Most of the time you\u2019ll blow past the five\u2011minute mark because starting is the only truly hard part. If five feels scary, start with two. The rule is: start, don\u2019t scare yourself with the entire mountain.\\n\\nSet a single daily \u201cmust\u2011do\u201d that moves the needle on your exams\u2014maybe one practice problem set or one chapter review. Do it before any gaming or phone\u2011scrolling. You\u2019ll probably still game later, but you\u2019ll do it with less guilt and more awareness. If you can\u2019t trust yourself to honor the order, unplug the console or hide the mouse until the task is done.\\n\\nReplace the infinite\u2011scroll phone habit with a dead\u2011simple activity that still scratches the \u201cthumb flick\u201d itch but ends quickly. Kindle books, a physical Rubik\u2019s cube, or a notepad for doodles all work. When you catch yourself grabbing the phone, redirect to one of these. You\u2019re not trying to be perfect; you\u2019re trying to interrupt the loop long enough to remember what you actually intend to do.\\n\\nTreat energy management as seriously as time management. Sleep at least seven hours, go for a 10\u2011minute walk every day, and eat something that didn\u2019t come from a package.

That label makes your brain think the problem is personality, not process, and it kills experimentation. You\u2019re an organism reacting predictably to stimuli. Tweak the stimuli, observe what changes, keep the tweaks that work, drop the rest. That\u2019s it.\\n\\nStart today with the two\u2011minute rule and one must\u2011do task.

It will give you energy for everything else.","percentile_10_comment":"First thing in the morning.","comment_o3":"Med school schedules are brutal, so the trick is to make your workouts something that can flex with you instead of something you have to clear a whole hour for. Pick a \u201cnon\u2011negotiable minimum\u201d that takes ten minutes or less\u201415 push\u2011ups, a quick YouTube HIIT, a set of body\u2011weight squats and planks, whatever makes you feel like you moved. On normal days you can do a full session, but on exam weeks you just hit that minimum, check the box, and move on. It feels almost too small to matter, yet it keeps the habit loop alive so you don\u2019t have to restart from zero.\\n\\nPut that minimum into your calendar the same way you\u2019d schedule clinic or lectures. If you normally shower in the morning, stack the mini\u2011workout right before the shower so you don\u2019t need extra clothing changes or commute time. Tired after a night shift? Do it as soon as you walk through the door, before your brain negotiates. The point is to tie it to an existing cue instead of relying on willpower.\\n\\nWhen bigger chunks of time open up, scale up the session, but view that as bonus, not baseline. Over the course of a year you\u2019ll have plenty of \u201cfull\u201d workouts, but you\u2019ll never have a zero\u2011week, and that consistency is what actually builds fitness. Think of it like flossing: one tooth is better than none, and it keeps the routine alive until you have time for the whole mouth.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, this is super common, especially with something as demanding as med school. One thing that might help is redefining what \u201csuccess\u201d looks like for your workouts during busy periods. Instead of aiming for a full workout, try committing to just 5-10 minutes of movement\u2014like a quick set of bodyweight exercises, stretching, or even a walk. The key is to keep the habit alive, even if the intensity drops. That way, you\u2019re not breaking your streak, and it\u2019s much easier to ramp back up when things calm down. Also, consider scheduling your workouts like appointments, even if they\u2019re short. If you miss a day, don\u2019t stress\u2014just get back to it the next day without guilt. Consistency over perfection is what builds the habit long-term. You\u2019ve already proven you enjoy exercise, so it\u2019s just about making it fit your current reality, not an ideal one."}},{"id":"t3_u23ck7","title":"[Need Advice] I can\'t make myself do anything and my life is falling apart","body":"\\nI don\'t seem to have the will power or the ability to make myself do the things I need to do live my life productively.\xa0 And even when I do build up a last resort \\"you need to do this *now*\\" feeling, I feel so physically tired it makes doing anything a complete slog unless I give myself caffeine or something to get me going.\xa0 I usually get enough sleep.\xa0 6-8 hours most nights.

Chronic fatigue and lack of drive can be straight\u2011up medical (thyroid, anemia, sleep apnea, lingering depression). Nothing about discipline works if your body chemistry is sabotaging you.\\n\\nNext, shrink the targets to absurdly small. Before bed, pick three non\u2011negotiables for tomorrow: one work task, one house task, one self\u2011care task. Make each a two\u2011minute starter version. \u201cOpen the report and write one sentence.\u201d \u201cPut ten dishes in the washer.\u201d \u201cStep into the shower and let the water hit me.\u201d The goal isn\u2019t completion, it\u2019s ignition. Momentum usually carries you past the two\u2011minute mark, but if it doesn\u2019t, you still logged a win and reinforce the habit loop.\\n\\nGuard the ignition window by disabling the escape hatch. Put the phone in another room and set a 25\u2011minute kitchen timer. You work until it rings, then you can check the phone for five minutes, then another 25. Pomodoro isn\u2019t magic, it just forces a start and limits doom\u2011scrolling.\\n\\nFor energy, treat yourself like you would a five\u2011year\u2011old: fixed bedtime and wake time every day, sunlight in the first hour you\u2019re up, a walk or any movement at lunch, and water before caffeine. If you\u2019re going to use caffeine, save it for strategic bursts, not a constant IV drip.\\n\\nAt home, keep chores on a visible loop: a whiteboard or sticky note with Mon\u2011Sun columns. When your SO sees you cross off \u201claundry: 15 minutes\u201d or \u201cvacuum: 5 minutes\u201d it shows effort and keeps the mental load from staying in their head.\\n\\nFinally, track these wins somewhere. A calendar with a fat X for every day you hit the three tiny tasks turns discipline into a video game streak. Missing one day is fine; missing two in a row is the danger zone.\\n\\nDo the check\u2011up, carve out two\u2011minute ignitions, block distractions for short sprints, and let tiny daily reps snowball. It feels embarrassingly small at first, but six weeks of small, consistent action will beat occasional heroic pushes every time.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, you\u2019re not alone in this\u2014what you\u2019re describing is actually pretty common, and it\u2019s good you\u2019re reaching out. The \u201cjust do it\u201d advice is frustrating because if it were that easy, you\u2019d already be doing it. When you\u2019re stuck in that cycle of avoidance and exhaustion, the key is to start as small as possible\u2014like, embarrassingly small. If cleaning a room feels impossible, try just picking up one item and putting it away. If showering is a struggle, commit to just standing under the water for a minute. The goal isn\u2019t to overhaul your life overnight, but to build up tiny wins that start to shift your momentum.\\n\\nFor work, try setting a timer for 5 or 10 minutes and tell yourself you only have to focus for that long. When the timer\u2019s up, you can stop if you want, but often you\u2019ll find it\u2019s easier to keep going once you\u2019ve started. Same goes for chores at home\u2014set a timer, do a little, and let that be enough for now.\\n\\nAlso, don\u2019t underestimate the impact of physical health on mental energy. Even if you\u2019re getting 6-8 hours of sleep, things like hydration, nutrition, and movement matter a lot. Try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning and getting outside for a 5-minute walk, even if it feels pointless. Sometimes the body needs a little nudge to get the mind going.\\n\\nLastly, if you\u2019re noticing this is a long-term pattern and it\u2019s affecting your hygiene and relationships, it might be worth checking in with a doctor or therapist just to rule out anything medical or to get some extra support.

For example, instead of a full game, make a single mechanic work. Instead of a full animation, just finish the donut, even if it looks bad. The real discipline comes from showing up regularly and finishing tiny things, not from waiting for a spark or a big breakthrough.

It is stagnating my growth and I\'m just sick of it.\\n\\nSo I\'ve come here asking for your help","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'d suggest to try breaking down the \'complex\' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)\\n\\nFor example: \\n\\n1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you\'re trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your \'excuse\' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. \\n\\nThe goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being \'complex\' or \'scary\'. You just see all things you did \'wrong\' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren\'t that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be \'beaten\' / fixed.\\n\\nBesides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to \'stop escaping\' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don\'t need it. Let\'s cross-check it altogether, let\'s not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you\'d like to stop escaping in first place.\\n\\n**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let\'s imagine (for example) it\'s social media. \\n\\nFine - for the list of things you \'escaped\', out of 10 things - let\'s imagine that 5 were \'escaped\' due to social media distraction. If it\'s true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it\'s something else - doesn\'t matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).\\n\\n**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before).

I know it feels like you\u2019re alone in your struggles but you are not.\\n\\nAlso, while reading this, it\u2019s seems like you are demanding a lot of yourself and punishing yourself when you don\u2019t meet those standards. First thing, I\u2019d say is to focus more on being more gentle with yourself. It\u2019s ok to have desires but try to stray away from the \u201cdo or die\u201d mindset and just focus on thinking of it more optimistically. Don\u2019t think \u201cI have to do this or x will happen\u201d but more \u201cIf I do this, x will happen\u201d. \\n\\nTrain yourself to do that everyday and you\u2019ll see change eventually. You\u2019ll be looking at your life with a healthier perspective and your desires will naturally be answered because of that. Patience and perseverance is key though. Take it day by day, and don\u2019t tell yourself that you are running out of time, as long as you are working towards what you want to accomplish in the present moment, you have time.","percentile_10_comment":"I\u2019ve been there. Turns out I had a lot of trauma that turned into anxiety that turned into numbness and/or inappropriate emotional reactions. I didn\u2019t understand me cuz I couldn\u2019t feel me. And I couldn\u2019t feel me because it was unbearable. \\n\\nMaybe it\u2019s today. Maybe it\u2019s five years from now. (A therapist or close friend can definitely help expedite the process.) One day you feel your feels. Pat yourself on the back if you do. This is called emotional processing and it\u2019s necessary to heal but it doesn\u2019t need to be rushed.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll be okay.","comment_o3":"First, none of the stuff you describe makes you broken or doomed\u2014it just means you\u2019re 18 and noticing your own rough edges for the first time. A \u201ccore self\u201d isn\u2019t something you find, it\u2019s something you build by repeatedly doing the things you decide matter. So start with one tiny, concrete action and let everything else orbit around that. Tomorrow, at a specific time, walk to the gym door, step inside for two minutes, then leave. That\u2019s it. The goal isn\u2019t the workout, it\u2019s proving to your brain that you can make a plan and carry it out even while scared. Do that three times this week; on the fourth visit, stay for five minutes and move some weight. You can apply the same template to anything: pick a time, define an action so small it feels almost silly, and execute.\\n\\nWhile you\u2019re stacking tiny wins, begin a nightly two\u2011minute journal. Date, then write: \u201cWhat did I do today that I chose?\u201d Even if the answer is \u201cI brushed my teeth on purpose,\u201d record it. After a month you\u2019ll have evidence of hundreds of moments where you acted instead of drifted. That list becomes the seed of personhood you think you lack.\\n\\nValues feel vague until they\u2019re attached to behavior. Grab three words you respect\u2014say honesty, curiosity, discipline\u2014write them at the top of a page, and each night jot one sentence of how you embodied or violated each. This keeps values alive and forces reflection without endless rumination.\\n\\nImpulse control improves with friction. Keep junk apps off your phone, store it in another room when you study, and when an urge hits, promise yourself you can give in after waiting five minutes. Most impulses evaporate when they have to survive that pause.\\n\\nFinally, you mentioned the bridge. Suicidal thoughts are a medical issue like any other; bring them to a professional, not just Reddit. Call 988 in the U.S. or use your country\u2019s equivalent, and make an appointment with campus counseling as soon as you arrive. You deserve help while you\u2019re learning these skills.\\n\\nKeep the goals embarrassingly small, log the wins, and your \u201ccore self\u201d will show up automatically\u2014because it will be made of things you\u2019ve actually done. Good luck; see you at tomorrow\u2019s two\u2011minute gym visit.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, a lot of what you\u2019re describing is more common than you think, especially at 18. Feeling like you don\u2019t have a \u201ccore self\u201d or that you\u2019re just reacting to situations is something a lot of people go through, especially when you\u2019re just starting to figure out who you are. The fear and paralysis around change is also super normal\u2014your brain is wired to keep you in familiar patterns, even if they suck.\\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: you don\u2019t need to have it all figured out to start making small changes. Don\u2019t try to overhaul your whole life at once. Pick one tiny thing you can control\u2014like making your bed every morning, or going for a 5-minute walk, or even just drinking a glass of water when you wake up. The point isn\u2019t the task itself, it\u2019s proving to yourself that you can do something on purpose, even when you don\u2019t feel like it.\\n\\nWhen your mind starts spiraling about being \u201cno one\u201d or not having values, try to pause and just do something physical\u2014stand up, stretch, splash water on your face. You don\u2019t have to solve your whole identity in your head right now. Action comes first, clarity comes later. If you want to try the gym, don\u2019t worry about your ego or fear\u2014just go and walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes. You don\u2019t have to be motivated or confident, you just have to show up.\\n\\nYou\u2019re not broken or doomed to stay this way. Most people who seem \u201cput together\u201d are just further along in the process of figuring themselves out, and they started with the same doubts. If you can, talk to someone you trust or a counselor at your college when you get there\u2014sometimes just saying this stuff out loud helps.

There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don\u2019t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very na\xefve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don\u2019t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn\u2019t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don\u2019t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \\nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.","comments":{"best_comment":"I\u2019ve been there, mate (I\u2019m 37M).

I\u2019ve been going to therapy, I\u2019ve been working on myself by looking long and hard at my life, I\u2019ve been working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof method, etc. What really started to make a big difference was my diet - I went zero carb and my mental health improved dramatically.

Pick one daily action that takes under two minutes\u2014make your bed, drink a glass of water, open the notes app and write a single sentence about the day. Do it at the same time every day for a week. Treat it like brushing your teeth: boring, automatic, non\u2011negotiable. When that feels automatic, add another two\u2011minute action that logically follows the first. String these tiny anchors together until you have a five\u2011minute \u201cmorning startup\u201d you can knock out half\u2011asleep. That\u2019s your foundation.\\n\\nNext, tackle the task/time chaos with external structure instead of willpower. Every night, brain\u2011dump tomorrow\u2019s tasks onto paper, then circle the one thing that would make the day a win even if nothing else happens. In the morning, set a 25\u2011minute timer and attack that circled task before checking your phone. When the timer ends, stand up, stretch, decide whether you need another round or a break. Repeat. If ADHD meds/coffee help, great\u2014just pair them with the timer so the focus window is aimed at the circled task instead of random browsing.\\n\\nTrack completions, not intentions. Keep a \u201cdone list\u201d beside the to\u2011do list and write down every finished Pomodoro, workout, or household chore. Seeing the list grow trains your brain that you\u2019re someone who follows through, even on small stuff, and that chips away at the \u201cempty vessel\u201d story.\\n\\nExpect the engine to stall. Bad sleep, off meds, rough mental day\u2014whatever. When you miss a day, treat it like a late library book: annoying fee, but you bring the book back and move on.

I\'m a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I\'m wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I\'d try to find professional help","percentile_10_comment":"Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called \'The Polyvagal Theory\'","comment_o3":"I was in the same boat a while back and what finally worked was treating focus like a muscle, not a light switch. Pick one priority (your courses, probably) and make a non\u2011negotiable five\u2011minute work slot every day\u2014short enough that your brain can\u2019t argue. Use a timer, shut off notifications, and give yourself permission to quit after the buzzer. When five minutes feels normal, add two more. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\nBefore each session, write the very next physical action\u2014\u201copen lecture notes and summarize page 1,\u201d not \u201cstudy chemistry.\u201d Less decision\u2011making means less room for your mind to bail. If you feel fidgety, stand up, stretch for thirty seconds, then sit back down and finish the timer.\\n\\nTrack your streak on paper. A growing chain of X\u2019s is surprisingly motivating. Spend a few minutes outside or do push\u2011ups daily; burning off surplus energy makes sitting still easier, and good sleep/food/water make a bigger difference than most hacks.\\n\\nWhen one of those rare hyper\u2011focus days shows up, milk it, but don\u2019t depend on them.

Since you\u2019re looking for practical stuff you can do on your own, here are a few things that might help: First, try lowering the bar for what \u201ccounts\u201d as a session. If 15 minutes feels like too much, aim for 5 minutes. Set a timer, do the thing, and then give yourself permission to stop. Sometimes just starting is the hardest part, and once you\u2019re in, you might find it easier to keep going. Second, try to cut out as many distractions as possible\u2014put your phone in another room, close extra tabs, whatever it takes. Third, experiment with \u201cbody doubling\u201d\u2014basically, working alongside someone else (even virtually, like a study-with-me video on YouTube). It can help with accountability and make it less painful to get started. Also, don\u2019t underestimate the power of routines: doing your work at the same time and place every day can train your brain to expect it. Lastly, be kind to yourself about the days you don\u2019t get much done. Progress isn\u2019t linear, and beating yourself up just makes it harder to start next time. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate, but small, consistent steps really do add up.
