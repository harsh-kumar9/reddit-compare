So what\'s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\\n\\nThat\'s how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol","percentile_10_comment":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.

First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you\'re juggling a lot, and it\'s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\\n\\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\\n\\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\\n\\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\\n\\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don\'t feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn\'t have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\\n\\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\\n\\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You\'ve got this!","comment_gpt5_verbositylow_efforthigh":"Good news: you don\u2019t need a \u201creset,\u201d you need guardrails that work with your brain. Think floor and ceiling. A floor for off-med days (bare minimums so you don\u2019t spiral) and a ceiling for on-med days (structured deep work so you use the focus well).\\n\\nOff-med floor: before you touch your phone, chug a big glass of water, eat a protein-first breakfast (eggs/Greek yogurt/protein shake + fruit), and take a 10\u201315 minute walk outside. Then do one 25-minute focus block on the most important thing for the day. That\u2019s it. Use the 5-minute rule to start anything. If you do only that on off days, you\u2019re winning.\\n\\nOn-med ceiling: plan the night before. Two 50\u201360 minute deep-work blocks early in the day for trading study/backtesting with the phone in another room, Freedom/Forest/Focusmate on, clear checklist, then stop. Schedule your workout at a fixed time and treat it like a class you can\u2019t miss. Keep start and stop times; don\u2019t try to \u201cgo all day.\u201d\\n\\nFood: control the environment, not your willpower. Don\u2019t keep trigger foods at home; if you must, buy single-serves and put them out of sight. Pre-plan tomorrow\u2019s meals before bed: 3 meals + 1 snack, protein + fiber at each. Eat before you\u2019re ravenous. When an urge hits, delay 10\u201315 minutes, drink water or a diet soda/tea, have a protein option, then decide. Brush your teeth after dinner. Track only three things for now: did I eat protein each meal, did I binge, what was the trigger.\\n\\nHydration and caffeine: make \u201cwater before coffee\u201d a rule. Aim for 1 liter by noon and another by 6 pm. Get a big bottle, add a squeeze of lemon or electrolytes if that helps. Taper caffeine, don\u2019t quit cold turkey; cut 25% per week and set a 2 pm cutoff, swap to tea/decaf later in the day.\\n\\nEnergy: fixed wake time all 7 days, get morning light, and move a little even off meds. A 10-minute walk after meals is huge for energy, mood, and appetite. If the gym feels impossible, do one set of squats, pushups, and a plank at home. Minimum viable movement counts.\\n\\nPhone: precommit to scroll windows (e.g., 12:30\u20131 pm and 8\u20138:30 pm). Everything else blocked. Charge the phone outside the bedroom. Use grayscale and app blockers during work blocks.\\n\\nWhen you slip, apply \u201cnever miss twice.\u201d After a binge or lazy day, do one piece of your floor within the hour\u2014glass of water, 5-minute tidy, 10-minute walk\u2014and move on. Perfectionism is the trap.\\n\\nDo a 20-minute weekly reset on Sunday: plan meals, order groceries, pick your two deep-work blocks for each on-med day, lay out workout clothes, and set one priority for each off-med day.\\n\\nAlso, loop in pros. The two-day med breaks might be making appetite swings worse\u2014ask your prescriber about dosing or whether breaks are necessary. For binge eating, CBT-E or a dietitian who knows ADHD/BED helps a ton. Starting that now sets you up well for the future, including pregnancy.\\n\\nFor the next 14 days, lock in three non-negotiables regardless of meds: water before coffee, protein breakfast, and a 10-minute walk.

It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on.

It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new.

Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\\n\\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections.

Build means skills and people.\\n\\nEvery weekday, set three protected blocks: 90 minutes for job search, 60 minutes for one skill, and your workout. Add two tiny non\u2011negotiables: 20 minutes outside and 10 minutes tidying. Track these on a wall calendar with an X each day. If motivation is low, use the two\u2011minute rule to start; once you\u2019ve begun, ride the momentum.\\n\\nGet income within 14 days. Don\u2019t chase perfect. Apply to five roles a day and walk into places. Because you\u2019re into fitness, hit local gyms, rec centers, and PT clinics for front desk, attendant, or trainer aide roles; get CPR/AED this week. If coaching interests you, register for a basic CPT and study during your skill block. If not, pick something that hires fast and gives structure\u2014warehouse, delivery, moving, hospitality\u2014while you upskill.\\n\\nMake a difference and build a support system by showing up where help is needed. Commit to one weekly volunteer shift at a food bank, animal shelter, Habitat build, or youth program. You\u2019ll meet good people and leave each shift feeling useful. On top of that, join one recurring group where the same faces appear: BJJ, CrossFit, climbing, run club, Toastmasters, or improv. The rule is simple: be on time, ask two questions, thank the organizer.\\n\\nUse your fitness to connect. Offer a free Saturday park workout for friends or neighbors. Post a simple invite, keep it beginner\u2011friendly, and be consistent. It scratches the \u201cmake a difference\u201d itch and can evolve into training experience or paid clients.\\n\\nPause dating for 6\u20138 weeks while you lock this routine. Put that energy into friendships. Text three old acquaintances this week with a low\u2011key invite like coffee or a walk. Keep conversations light, avoid dumping, and aim to be the person who follows through. Call your parents weekly.\\n\\nGuard your mind. Fixed sleep and wake times, sunlight in the morning, decent food, and limits on alcohol/weed/doomscrolling will do more for your mood than you expect. If depression keeps hanging around, book a therapist or doctor; that\u2019s not a moral failure, it\u2019s a performance tool.\\n\\nStart today by updating your resume, booking one volunteer shift, and laying out tomorrow\u2019s clothes.

If you\'re working on a bigger habit, you might save up for something more substantial, like a new book or a day trip.

My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I\'m at the point where I\'m losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'m not a therapist but I don\'t think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\\n\\nThe advice given by others is good but I\'d like to add some that I haven\'t seen mentioned:\\n\\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it\'s questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\\n\\nThat\'s what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I\'m no therapist. I\'m just sharing what has worked for me.\\n\\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I\'m my own daughter. No, I\'m not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it\'s hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\\n\\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\\n\\nGood luck!","percentile_10_comment":"Try journalling.

One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn\'t mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\\n\\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\\n\\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it\'s a process, and it\'s okay to take small steps. You\'re on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!","comment_gpt5_verbositylow_efforthigh":"Don\u2019t aim to suppress emotions; aim to separate the feeling from the choice. Emotions are data, not directives.\\n\\nWhen you feel a spike, impose a no-action window. Ten minutes minimum; 24 hours if intensity is above 6/10. Do five slow breaths and move your body for a few minutes. Then write before deciding: split a page into Facts vs Story and What I Want vs What I\u2019m Getting. List your options and the most likely outcomes in 1 week and 1 month. Decide after you\u2019ve written.\\n\\nCreate personal policies so tricky calls are pre-decided: no big decisions after 10 pm, no texts or emails when angry, no commitments when sleep-deprived, and if emotion is above 6/10, wait until morning.\\n\\nBuild reps. Use the protocol on small stuff daily so it becomes automatic. Keep a decision journal (date, emotion rating, your prediction, outcome) and review weekly to calibrate.\\n\\nSupport it with basics: consistent sleep, regular exercise, solid meals; keep alcohol and caffeine moderate.

Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I\'m not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn\'t even went to give my exams \\n\\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room.

In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \\n\\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \\n\\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don\'t  distract yourself with comfort.

Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \\n\\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear.

Do a daily review of the day\\n\\n**Assess the situation**.  \\nThis is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  \\nI started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  \\nInfrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  \\nThen i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  \\nAfter that i started to plot in my daily habbits.

For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\\n\\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we\'re the biggest issues in my life.\\n\\n**Map out your ideal self**  \\nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy.

First off, it\'s great that you\'re taking a dance class\u2014that\'s a fantastic step towards meeting new people and building confidence. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and it\'s okay to feel a bit lost. Here are a few ideas to help you get started on your journey:\\n\\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small, manageable goals that can help build your confidence. It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.\\n\\n2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields. This could open up new job opportunities and help you feel more accomplished.\\n\\n3. **Networking**: Since you\'re shy, try online communities related to your interests. They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.\\n\\n4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.\\n\\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can help build your self-worth and motivate you to keep going.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time. You\'re already on the right path by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep pushing forward, and you\'ll find your way. \ud83d\ude0a","comment_gpt5_verbositylow_efforthigh":"Skip the life overhaul. Build a simple 12\u2011week system and let the reps change how you feel.\\n\\nMake three anchors you can keep even on low\u2011energy days: same wake time every day, a 25\u2011minute \u201ccareer block\u201d on weekdays, and one deliberate social rep each week. If you miss, do a 5\u2011minute version and don\u2019t miss twice.\\n\\nUse the career block to move from admin to higher\u2011paying coordinator roles that value what you already do: project coordinator, operations coordinator, HR/recruiting coordinator, or marketing ops. Pick one path and focus. Rotate learning and building. Learn Excel basics that actually get used (sorting, filters, conditional formatting, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, pivot tables) and one project tool like Asana, Trello, or Jira. Build small artifacts: a sample project plan, a simple SOP for a process, and an Excel dashboard on a dataset you care about. Free/cheap options: Google Project Management certificate on Coursera, and YouTube channels like Leila Gharani for Excel.\\n\\nBy week two, start the job pipeline. Update your resume to be achievement\u2011based and quantified: \u201cSupported a team of 12; coordinated 3 calendars; created a shared inbox SOP that cut response time from 3 days to 1; tracked 120+ requests/month; maintained reports in Excel using pivot tables.\u201d Each week, send five targeted applications and two short informational messages to people in your chosen role. Track it in a simple spreadsheet. Every Friday, review what got done and set next week\u2019s targets.\\n\\nFor social, your dance class is perfect. Show up ten minutes early and ask one person a tiny question about class or shoes, then volunteer one sentence about yourself. After class, suggest a low\u2011effort next step like, \u201cI\u2019m grabbing tea down the street\u2014want to join?\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m practicing on Saturday at the park if you want to run the combo.\u201d Do that once a week; familiarity plus repetition does the heavy lifting. If you can, add one more recurring group activity so you see the same faces.\\n\\nKeep basic energy habits so discipline feels doable: 7\u20138 hours of sleep with a fixed bedtime, a 20\u2011minute walk most days, and a simple meal template you repeat. Put your phone to charge outside the bedroom and lay out clothes the night before to lower friction in the morning.\\n\\nTrack your reps with a calendar or habit app and keep a short \u201cdone list\u201d each day. That turns vague self\u2011judgment into concrete progress and builds evidence that you follow through.\\n\\nGive this 12 weeks. You\u2019ll exit with a couple new contacts, a handful of portfolio pieces, a sharper resume, and a steady application rhythm.

I\'m also in a new job so I\'m constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here\'s what my week looks like - \\n\\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it\'s time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \\n\\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \\n\\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I\'ve been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\\n\\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","comments":{"best_comment":"I personally don\'t think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation.

WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example.

Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH).

This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\\n\\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.\\n\\n3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there\'s a way to manage it better. It\'s important to have time for yourself outside of work.\\n\\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.\\n\\n5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.\\n\\n6. **Seek Support**: If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor.

Put a calendar block at, say, 6:30, wrap up with a 10-minute shutdown (write tomorrow\u2019s top 3, clear inbox, close the laptop, say \u201cdone for today\u201d), then do a 10-minute \u201cfake commute\u201d walk.

Eat at set times, aim for protein + produce each meal, and keep trigger snacks out of reach or pre-portioned.

For two weeks, write down what you\u2019ll eat before you eat it\u2014awareness alone helps a lot.\\n\\nDefang the Sunday scaries with a Sunday reset and a Monday cushion.

You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\\n\\nSince you\u2019re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time.

For dinners, pick fast, repeatable meals: dal + rice + salad, sambar + rice, paneer bhurji + toast, egg curry + rice, veg khichdi + dahi. Skip rotis on weekdays; they eat time.

Set specific times for workouts, meals, and study sessions. Consistency can help you regain that sense of discipline.\\n\\n4. **Limit Screen Time**: Set specific times for using your phone or computer for leisure. You can use apps to help limit your screen time if you find it hard to do on your own.\\n\\n5. **Find Support**: If possible, connect with friends or a community that shares your goals.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day\'s productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance.

Here are a few steps that might help you work on this:\\n\\n1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning more about the cultures and histories of the groups you find yourself judging. Understanding the context and experiences of others can help break down stereotypes.\\n\\n2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it\'s based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\\n\\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\\n\\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\\n\\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds. Listening to their stories and perspectives can be eye-opening and help you grow.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time and effort, but acknowledging the problem is a huge first step. Keep at it, and don\'t be too hard on yourself as you work through this.","comment_gpt5_verbositylow_efforthigh":"Treat this like breaking any habit. You can\u2019t always control the first thought, but you can train the second one.\\n\\nMake an if-then plan: \u201cIf I see an inflammatory clip or a protest post, then I pause for 10 seconds, say to myself, \u2018These are individuals, not a race. What\u2019s a non\u2011racial explanation?\u2019 and either scroll past or look for credible context.\u201d\\n\\nDo a quick counter-stereotype rep each time you catch it: bring to mind two counterexamples from that group or two alternative explanations (poverty, age, location, incentives, editing). It\u2019s 30 seconds, but it rewires the association over time.\\n\\nChange your inputs. Unfollow outrage/fail accounts, mute keywords, add time limits, remove feeds from your phone, and replace with long\u2011form reporting or creators from varied backgrounds doing normal, everyday stuff. Outrage clips are cherry\u2011picked; don\u2019t let algorithms train your brain.\\n\\nTrack it. Keep a simple tally: trigger, replacement line used, moved on or not. Review weekly and aim for more catches and less rumination time. Treat slips as reps, not failures.\\n\\nGet real contact. Join a class/club or volunteer where you collaborate with people from different backgrounds once a week. Repeated, positive interaction collapses stereotypes faster than anything online.\\n\\nDo 5 minutes of mindfulness daily to notice thoughts and let them pass. And audit your language: ban \u201calways/they are X,\u201d force \u201csome individuals in this clip did Y.\u201d\\n\\nRun this for 30 days.

I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\\\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","comments":{"best_comment":"PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS\\n\\nHonestly though you\u2019re probably better off than you think if you see the problems.

First off, congrats on the weight loss\u2014that\'s a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you\'re ready to take control of your life, and that\'s a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it\'s setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\\n\\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\\n\\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn\'t take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\\n\\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\\n\\n6. **Seek Support**: Don\'t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\\n\\nRemember, progress takes time, and it\'s okay to have setbacks.

You\u2019re not behind; you\u2019re at the start of your next decade with proof you can change.\\n\\nDo a 30\u2011day reset to stabilize your brain and energy. Same wake time every day, no alcohol or weed for the month, 30 minutes of walking or lifting daily, three real meals with protein and water, and morning sunlight for a few minutes. Keep it boring and repeatable. This alone will calm the overthinking and make everything else easier.\\n\\nUse a simple daily template so you\u2019re never guessing. Run the Rule of 3: one thing for Health, one for Money, one for Relationships. Do those before entertainment. Example: morning walk and quick lift, a 90\u2011minute \u201cmoney block\u201d for job search/skill study or side work, and one social touch like a call or in\u2011person class. Everything after that is optional, but the day is already a win.\\n\\nTo be more present and a better listener, anchor your attention with your body. Feel your feet on the floor, slow your exhale, and wait two seconds before replying. Then mirror back one sentence of what they said and ask one open question. Put your phone face\u2011down and out of reach during conversations. That tiny loop\u2014notice breath, pause, summarize, follow\u2011up\u2014will make you feel engaged fast.\\n\\nExternalize your thoughts so they stop looping. Every morning, do a 10\u2011minute brain dump in your notes and pick today\u2019s Health/Money/Relationships actions. Every night, a 5\u2011minute check: what worked, what\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s first step. When you get a new perspective, write it as a one\u2011sentence rule and pin it. Re\u2011read your rules each morning for recall.\\n\\nSince competitive gaming hijacks your reward system, take 30\u201390 days off COD and pair it with the alcohol/weed break. Uninstall, log out, or put the console away. Replace the slot with physical competition or community\u2014lifting with a plan, BJJ, rec sports, or a class. You\u2019re keeping the competitive itch but making it pay you back.\\n\\nStop waiting for a perfect passion. Pick a useful, trainable lane and let skill create interest. Good options: IT help desk (CompTIA A+ or Google IT), a trade apprenticeship, CDL, HVAC, medical tech, or sales. Do a 12\u2011week sprint: every weekday, 90 minutes of study or applications, and track outputs.

I\'d legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I\'ve done just that before.\\n\\nI realize it will ultimately come to \\"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\\" which is fine. But ideally I\'d like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","comments":{"best_comment":"Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\\n\\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\\n\\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps.

They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\\n\\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You\'ve got this!","comment_gpt5_verbositylow_efforthigh":"You\u2019re not broken, you\u2019re overloaded. Build scaffolding and let the system carry you for a bit. Here\u2019s a simple 6\u20138 week reset that has helped a lot of people in your spot.\\n\\nEnergy first. Pick a fixed wake time and protect it every day for two weeks. Get outside light within 30 minutes of waking for 10\u201315 minutes. Cut caffeine 8+ hours before bed, park your phone outside the bedroom, and do a 20\u201330 minute wind\u2011down routine. Given the weight and unrefreshing sleep, ask your doctor for a sleep study and basic labs (iron/ferritin, thyroid, B12, vitamin D, testosterone). Untreated sleep issues make ADHD meds feel useless.\\n\\nDaily structure next. Run three non\u2011negotiable blocks on weekdays: a 60\u201390 minute \u201cdeep work\u201d block for the top job task due soonest, a 60 minute law block, and a 15\u201320 minute home reset. Use timers (25/5), put your phone in another room, and body\u2011double (Focusmate, library, study buddy). Adopt the \u201cjust five minutes\u201d rule to start\u2014momentum does the rest.\\n\\nStabilize your job. Each morning, send your manager a short plan for the day; each afternoon, send what you finished and what\u2019s next. Ask for micro\u2011deadlines and early check\u2011ins. Break work into visible deliverables and aim to deliver something by 3 p.m. every day.\\n\\nFinish or formally pause the degree\u2014don\u2019t linger. Book a meeting with your advisor this week. Map the remaining modules and pick exam/assignment dates. Schedule your daily 60 minute law block at the same time, in the same place, with body\u2011doubling. Keep a visible checklist and cross off one concrete output per day.\\n\\nClean up money with one focused session. Make a complete list of debts and due dates, call each creditor, and set small autopays/payment plans. Freeze unnecessary cards and open a separate \u201cbills\u201d account so fixed expenses are paid first. Open every envelope and put all due dates on a single calendar.\\n\\nTame the apartment with a nightly 15\u2011minute reset\u2014trash, dishes, laundry in that order. Do one 60\u201390 minute weekend \u201creset\u201d for floors, bathroom, and bedding. If it\u2019s truly unsanitary, hire a one\u2011time cleaner to jump\u2011start momentum; then maintain with the nightly reset.\\n\\nFor meetings/class anxiety, prep one sentence you\u2019ll say and one question you can ask. Speak early to reduce anticipatory anxiety. It reads as engaged, not awkward.\\n\\nTwo\u2011week starter challenge: fixed wake time + morning light, one 60 minute law block daily, one 15 minute home reset nightly, and daily manager check\u2011ins. Don\u2019t chase motivation\u2014chase starts and finishes.

We\'re talking beyond attitude and effort and willpower. It\'s cost me every job and hobby I\'ve ever had and it\'s cost me the love of my life. \\n\\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I\'ve been a game developer for a decade and I\'ve never finished a game. I\'ve been playing musical instruments and singing my entire life but I\'ve never managed to learn sheet music or any scales or arpeggios on anything. Believe me I have tried. The trying never lasts long enough. The shame is overwhelming.\\n\\nI\'m sick of not being good at anything. I\'m sick of this abstract baseless fear ruling my life. How the fuck am I supposed to overcome a discipline aversion without discipline?! Has anyone conquered something this deeply rooted? What steps did you take?","comments":{"best_comment":"I looked at how my life was going and instead of getting angry or resentful, I got motivated. I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on \u2014 as you seem to well know. \\n\\nI set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \\n\\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I\u2019m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\\n\\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I\u2019d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don\u2019t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I\u2019d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn\u2019t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn\u2019t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \\n\\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly.

It sounds like you\'re dealing with a pretty tough challenge, but the fact that you\'re reaching out for advice is a great first step. Overcoming a deep-rooted aversion to discipline can be tricky, but it\'s definitely possible with some patience and strategy.\\n\\nFirst, try to reframe how you view discipline. Instead of seeing it as a rigid, external force, think of it as a tool that helps you achieve what you truly want. Start small\u2014pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas. The key is consistency, not intensity.\\n\\nAlso, consider breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Celebrate small wins to build momentum and confidence.\\n\\nIt might also help to find a community or accountability partner who shares your interests. Having someone to share progress with can make the journey feel less isolating and more motivating.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself. Progress isn\'t always linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and remember that every small step forward is a victory.
