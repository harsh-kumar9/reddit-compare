Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\\n\\nYou wouldn\'t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what\'s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\\n\\nThat\'s how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol","percentile_10_comment":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.

First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you\'re juggling a lot, and it\'s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\\n\\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\\n\\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\\n\\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\\n\\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don\'t feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn\'t have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\\n\\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\\n\\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You\'ve got this!","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not broken; you\u2019re running into very predictable ADHD + stimulant rebound + BED patterns. Willpower isn\u2019t the fix\u2014simple systems are.\\n\\nFirst, talk to your prescriber about the two-day med breaks. Many people binge and crash on \u201coff\u201d days. You may do better with a different dose, schedule, or an adjunct (and BED-specific therapy like CBT\u2011E). Don\u2019t white\u2011knuckle this alone when there are tools made for it.\\n\\nBuild two modes for your week. Vyvanse days = deep work and training focus. Off days = recovery and maintenance (errands, laundry, meal prep, walks, light workouts). Plan each the night before so you wake up already knowing \u201ctoday is a Mode A or Mode B day.\u201d\\n\\nCreate a tiny daily floor you hit every single day, no matter what. Three anchors: water, protein, movement. As soon as you wake, finish 16\u201324 oz water (set it on your nightstand before bed). Eat protein in the first hour (eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake). Move for 10 minutes outside. If the day goes sideways, you still did your floor.\\n\\nStructure food to prevent binges: three meals plus 1\u20132 snacks, never go >4 hours. Each eating time gets protein + fiber + carbs. Don\u2019t \u201csave calories\u201d; that primes binges. Pre\u2011plan the next day\u2019s simple menu in 2 minutes at night. Keep tempting binge foods out of the house for now or buy single\u2011serves only. Use an \u201curge delay\u201d: when the craving hits, set a 10\u2011minute timer, drink a glass of water, brush teeth, take a short walk. If you still want it after, portion it into a bowl and sit at the table. Repeatable beats perfect.\\n\\nReduce phone pull with friction. Charge it outside the bedroom. First hour of the day is phone\u2011free. Put it in another room during meals and focus blocks. Grayscale + app limits + a blank home screen help more than \u201ctrying harder.\u201d\\n\\nOn Vyvanse days, do 2\u20133 focus blocks of 25/5 or 50/10. Before each block, write the one next action in a verb form (\u201cOpen notes, outline Section 1\u201d). Body\u2011double if you can (friend, library, Focusmate). End your work by writing tomorrow\u2019s first three actions so you restart fast.\\n\\nOn off days, still move: a walk, light lift, yoga, or a 15\u2011minute \u201cmovement snack\u201d every few hours. Use those days for batch cooking, groceries, and tidying so med days can be for deep work.\\n\\nCap caffeine (e.g., 200\u2013300 mg before noon) and taper 25% per week if needed. Lock sleep: same wake time daily, morning light, screens off 60 minutes before bed. These two alone will boost energy and appetite regulation.\\n\\nWhen you slip, reset in the next hour, not next Monday. Go straight to the floor: water + protein + 10\u2011minute walk. No punishment, no \u201cmake up for it.\u201d Just resume.\\n\\nIf you want two quick resources: Overcoming Binge Eating (Fairburn) for BED skills and Your Brain\u2019s Not Broken (Nagoski/Saline) for ADHD strategies.

There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself.

Rewarding yourself is a fantastic way to reinforce positive habits. The key is to choose rewards that are enjoyable but don\'t undermine your progress. For small goals, consider simple pleasures like taking a relaxing walk, enjoying a favorite snack, or watching an episode of a show you love. If you\'re working on a bigger habit, you might save up for something more substantial, like a new book or a day trip. The important thing is to make sure the reward feels special and is something you genuinely look forward to.

My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I\'m at the point where I\'m losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'m not a therapist but I don\'t think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\\n\\nThe advice given by others is good but I\'d like to add some that I haven\'t seen mentioned:\\n\\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it\'s questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\\n\\nThat\'s what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I\'m no therapist. I\'m just sharing what has worked for me.\\n\\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I\'m my own daughter. No, I\'m not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it\'s hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\\n\\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\\n\\nGood luck!","percentile_10_comment":"Try journalling.

One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn\'t mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\\n\\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\\n\\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it\'s a process, and it\'s okay to take small steps. You\'re on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!","comment_gpt5":"You don\u2019t need to suppress emotions; you need a repeatable process that keeps hot-state impulses from making cold-state decisions.\\n\\nUse a cooling-off rule.

Don\u2019t hit send or buy or commit until the timer ends.\\n\\nMake if-then plans for your trigger situations.

Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I\'m not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn\'t even went to give my exams \\n\\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \\n\\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \\n\\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don\'t  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don\'t distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \\n\\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I\'m gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow.

Focus on those and be okay with not doing everything at once. It\'s also helpful to create a schedule or routine that includes time for rest and relaxation. Remember, it\'s not about doing everything perfectly, but about making consistent progress. You might also want to try habit stacking, where you pair a new habit with an existing one, to make it easier to incorporate into your day. Lastly, don\'t forget to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. You\'re already doing great by being more productive than before, so keep building on that!","comment_gpt5":"You\u2019re not supposed to do everything every day.

Groceries once a week with a standard list or delivery. Cook 2\u20133 big batches and reheat. Do a daily 15 min tidy and one weekly 60 min clean. Read via audiobooks while commuting/cleaning.

It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.\\n\\n2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields.

They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.\\n\\n4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.\\n\\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

You have a degree, admin experience, and you already took action with the dance class. Here\u2019s a simple, doable reset that builds momentum fast.\\n\\nFor the next 8 weeks, run a \u201cone habit, one skill, one social rep\u201d plan. Every day, do a 20\u201330 min walk or basic workout to anchor your day; do a 30\u201345 min focused skill block for career upgrade before work or right after; do one tiny social action. Track these three boxes on paper and aim to never miss twice.\\n\\nPick one path for your skill block and commit to it for 8 weeks. Easiest pay bump from admin is toward operations/project coordination or data/reporting. If you like organizing people/tasks, do the Google Project Management cert on Coursera and build a simple portfolio: a mock project plan, timeline, risk log. If you don\u2019t mind numbers, do advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, PowerQuery) plus a basic SQL intro; build one small dashboard from a public dataset. Free resources: Leila Gharani on YouTube for Excel, freeCodeCamp for SQL. Keep it boringly consistent: same time, timer on, phone away.\\n\\nStart job moves in week 3 while you\u2019re still learning. Update your resume to highlight outcomes (e.g., \u201ccoordinated X, cut turnaround by Y%, managed Z invoices/week\u201d). Aim 5\u201310 tailored applications a week for roles like Project Coordinator, Operations Coordinator, Customer Success Associate, HR/Recruiting Coordinator, Reporting Analyst/Business Ops. Do two 15\u2011minute coffee chats a week on LinkedIn with people in those roles; ask what they actually do, what tools they use, and what junior wins look like.\\n\\nLeverage dance class as your social rep. Show up 10 minutes early and say one line to two people each session: \u201cHey, I\u2019m [name], how long have you been coming?\u201d Learn names; on week 3, ask one person, \u201cWant to practice after class or grab tea?\u201d Consistency plus small asks beats waiting for confidence.\\n\\nMake the routine easy to keep. Set clothes out the night before, block distracting sites during your skill block, put your phone in another room, and do a 2\u2011minute \u201cbare minimum\u201d version on rough days. Do a 20\u2011minute Sunday review: check your streak, choose next week\u2019s lessons, line up applications, and plan which class you\u2019ll attend.\\n\\nSelf\u2011esteem follows evidence.

I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun.

Since you mentioned a past interest in physical sciences, maybe revisiting that could reignite some excitement. You could start by taking an online course or joining a local science club to see if it still sparks your interest. Also, your skills in problem-solving and creating could be a great fit for fields like data analysis or product development, where you can see the impact of your work. As for your idea about self-help videos or daily routines on YouTube, it sounds promising! It could be a way to connect with people and share your journey, which aligns with your values. Just start small, maybe with a few videos, and see how it feels. Remember, finding your passion is often about trying new things and being open to where they might lead.

Give yourself 12 weeks and run two focused experiments, then let data (not mood) decide.\\n\\nPick two hypotheses that fit your values and skills. First: evidence-based science/health communication. Start a simple channel breaking down health products and popular claims with sources and first principles. Two short videos a week for six weeks, phone only, your own audio/design, no perfectionism. After each week, score four things: energy (1\u201310), learning (1\u201310), audience response (views/comments/saves), and a revenue path you feel good about. Second: applied consumer insights with implementation. Find a small business or nonprofit, take one measurable problem from insight to action: do quick research, propose a change, implement, report results. Track the same four numbers. This tests your \u201cimpact beyond analysis\u201d box.\\n\\nIf physical sciences still tug at you, do a 4\u2011week taste test: one MOOC with problem sets and a tiny project, 60\u201390 minutes daily.

Book five informational chats across these paths this month to see real day\u2011to\u2011day.\\n\\nAlign your current biz with your honesty value: only sell what you\u2019d buy and can back with evidence, or pivot to transparent reviews/affiliates. That pairs well with path one and lets you connect with people while using psych/econ/research and your audio/design skills.\\n\\nAfter 12 weeks, pick the path with the best combo of energy + traction and commit 12 months. Put blinders on and stick to the block/ship/review cadence. If you want to test YouTube now, do a 30\u2011day daily short (your routine or \u201cmyth of the day\u201d). Done > perfect.

You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\\n\\nSince you\u2019re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time.

Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\\n\\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks.

Staying consistent with exercise can be tough, but you\'re definitely not alone in this struggle.

This way, you\'re less likely to burn out.\\n\\nAlso, consider mixing up your workouts to keep things interesting. If you\'re an early morning person, maybe try different types of exercises that you can look forward to, like a new class or a run in a different location.

For most people with your hours, that\u2019s pre\u2011work. Try a 30\u201360 minute focused study block right after your morning light/movement, before you open work apps. If mornings aren\u2019t possible, do a 25\u201345 minute session at lunch and another short one right after you shut down work, before dinner or couch. Treat these like meetings: calendar block, phone in another room, website blocker on, timer running. On weekends, do one longer block when you\u2019re fresh to move big items forward.\\n\\nLittle boosts add up: hydrate early and steadily, add a pinch of salt if you\u2019re low-energy, keep your workspace bright, and alternate sitting/standing. Plan your week on Sunday\u2014sleep first, then work, then two or three realistic study slots\u2014and defend those time blocks.\\n\\nIf you give this two consistent weeks and you\u2019re still fighting heavy daytime sleepiness, get basic labs and a sleep check (iron, thyroid, apnea). But for most, consistent sleep, light, movement, and smarter meal/caffeine timing make the 11/after\u2011lunch/9 p.m. crashes manageable. You\u2019ll feel human again, and studies will fit."}},{"id":"t3_zm4r0t","title":"[need advice] I feel like I am going back to my old habits","body":"So I\'m(19F)  a young student and I was living alone but due to complicated reasons I had to go back to my parents house.

Consistency is key, and over time, these small habits can make a big difference.\\n\\nConsider a decluttering session. Sometimes, having too much stuff can make cleaning feel impossible. Go through your things and decide what you really need or love. Donate or discard the rest. Less clutter means less to clean.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t hesitate to ask for help.

Do three fast passes through the whole place: carry a trash bag and collect all trash/recycling, carry a hamper and scoop every piece of clothing/towels, then gather all dishes to the sink/dishwasher. Start one load of laundry and run the dishwasher, and call that Round 1. If you have gas left, wipe obvious surfaces and vacuum the main paths\u2014good enough beats perfect.

At night, do a 10-minute reset: clear the sink, run the dishwasher, put clothes in the hamper, restore floors to \u201cno objects.\u201d In the morning, unload the dishwasher while coffee brews and make the bed. If the hamper is 2/3 full, do one load from start to put-away that day. Each week, schedule two 30-minute appointments: bathrooms one day, floors/dust another. Put them in your calendar and set reminders like you would for class or a hike.\\n\\nReduce friction so tidy is the default. Put a hamper where clothes come off, hooks by the door, a donate box near the exit, and a small cleaning caddy in each bathroom/kitchen so you can wipe as you go. Use micro-rules: never leave a room empty-handed, if it takes under two minutes do it now, \u201ctouch it once\u201d by putting things away\u2014not down, and no dishes left overnight.

Examples: send one outreach message, share a draft, ask a question in a meeting, try a new workout. The win is doing the rep, not the result.\\n\\nBeat procrastination with starts, not finishes. Use the 10-minute rule, timebox with a timer, and \u201cfinish ugly\u201d to dodge perfectionism.

Adjust the plan, not the goal. This prevents drift back to autopilot.\\n\\nKeep your base steady: sleep, light, movement, real food, water. Low energy often looks like apathy.\\n\\nToday: choose one area, define your daily minimum, schedule tomorrow\u2019s block, and set up the first five minutes. Then do one discomfort rep.

I\'ve gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day.

I don\'t understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I\'m not sure if that has something to do with it as they\'re not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\\n\\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don\'t know what to say to my dad. I can\'t just say \\"I didn\'t do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\\", and I most certainly can\'t say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships.

Keep it short: you didn\u2019t meet standards last term, you\u2019re taking concrete steps to fix it, and you\u2019re asking about SAP/probation, appeal options, and whether a reduced load or official leave is smarter for spring. Then tell your dad the truth, but bring a plan: \u201cI blew my first semester. I own it. Here\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing next.\u201d\\n\\nAbout taking the second semester: if you cannot commit right now to a basic routine for two weeks (no porn/games, two short study blocks daily, consistent sleep), take an official leave instead of rolling the dice and digging the hole deeper. If you can stick to that routine immediately, go back on a light load. Make the call with your advisor and financial aid so you don\u2019t lose standing or aid unnecessarily.\\n\\nOn the porn/gaming loop, make access genuinely hard. Move the computer out of your bedroom. Uninstall all games and delete accounts if you can. Put a router-level DNS filter like CleanBrowsing/OpenDNS and have someone else set the password. On your devices, use Screen Time/Family Link with a recovery passcode you don\u2019t know. Create a non-admin account on your computer so you can\u2019t install/disable things. If you need a device for school, use a cheap Chromebook with only school apps. Add accountability: daily check-ins with a friend/mentor/counselor, or a support group for compulsive sexual behavior. If you can, see a therapist who treats this; it accelerates change.\\n\\nFor the \u201cI keep getting up or falling asleep\u201d problem, stop working in your room. Go to the library or a public table. Start comically small: set a 5\u2011minute timer and open the assignment. When the timer ends, take a 2\u2011minute break and do another 5\u201315. Pomodoro (25/5) works, but start smaller if 25 feels heavy. Have a start ritual: water, headphones, open the doc, write one sentence. When an urge hits, leave the room and do a 10\u2011minute walk or 20 bodyweight reps, then come back; urges pass if you don\u2019t feed them.\\n\\nLock in basics because they lower cravings and anxiety: wake at the same time, morning sunlight for 10 minutes, 30 minutes of walking or lifting daily, protein with each meal, and a consistent bedtime.

I\u2019m implementing a structured plan (counseling, accountability, reduced distractions, set study blocks). I\u2019m requesting probation/appeal information and guidance on reduced load or a leave.\u201d To your dad: same message plus your daily schedule and what you want him to hold you accountable to.\\n\\nNext 48 hours: send the emails, book counseling, move the computer, wipe games, set the locks with an outside passcode, and do two short study blocks at the library. Apply for a part-time job if you take a leave; structure beats willpower.\\n\\nYou\u2019re 18. This is fixable.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day\'s productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance.

Ask yourself why you think that way and if it\'s based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\\n\\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\\n\\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\\n\\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds.

I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\\\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","comments":{"best_comment":"PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS\\n\\nHonestly though you\u2019re probably better off than you think if you see the problems.

First off, congrats on the weight loss\u2014that\'s a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you\'re ready to take control of your life, and that\'s a great first step.

Maybe it\'s setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\\n\\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\\n\\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn\'t take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\\n\\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\\n\\n6. **Seek Support**: Don\'t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\\n\\nRemember, progress takes time, and it\'s okay to have setbacks.

Uninstall and block (Cold Turkey/Focus), move the console/PC out of the bedroom, delete Discord/YouTube from your phone, and tell one person you trust. Fill the time gap on purpose with exercise and in\u2011person activities. If cravings are rough, hit SMART Recovery/AA/NA or a therapist\u2014humans beat habits in groups.\\n\\nRun a \u201cMinimum Viable Day\u201d so you know you did enough: same wake and lights\u2011out every day; 10 minutes outside in the morning; one protein/veg meal you cook; 30 minutes of sweat; 60 minutes of focused work or learning; 15 minutes cleaning; 10 minutes planning/journaling. Put these as checkboxes on paper. If the day goes sideways, do any two to keep the streak alive.\\n\\nTo be present and listen better, use tiny rules you can execute anywhere. Before talking, two slow breaths. While they talk, keep your phone face down and your eyes on them. Paraphrase one sentence of what they said and ask one open question (\u201cWhat was the hardest part?\u201d). Wait two seconds before replying. When your mind spirals, ground yourself with 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.) or box breathing for a minute.\\n\\nIf you lose helpful perspectives overnight, capture and review. Keep one note called \u201cToday.\u201d Each morning write one sentence: What matters today. Each night add one sentence: What I learned. Read yesterday\u2019s before you start. Do a 20\u2011minute weekly review on Sunday: look over the week, pick three priorities for next week, schedule them.\\n\\nCareer: don\u2019t hunt for passion; run 8\u2011week skill sprints. Pick one path with clear entry options, do 60 minutes a day, build a tiny proof, talk to three people in that field, then decide to continue or pivot. Examples: IT support (Google IT cert + home lab), bookkeeping (Excel + mock books), sales (commission retail + cold\u2011call reps), a trade (apply as an apprentice). After one sprint, you\u2019ll have either momentum or clarity.\\n\\nMoney: separate accounts. Direct deposit bill money into a \u201cBills\u201d account you don\u2019t touch, use a \u201cSpending\u201d account with a weekly cap, and stash $1k as a starter emergency fund. Track every dollar for 30 days with a notes app or YNAB/EveryDollar. Automate what you can.\\n\\nSocial and awareness: join one thing that meets in person twice a week for eight weeks (gym class, BJJ, run club, Toastmasters, volunteering, church/12\u2011step/Meetup). Go even when you don\u2019t feel like it. Say hi to three people each time. Consistent attendance beats charm.\\n\\nTools that help: Pomodoro 25/5 for focus, a bedtime alarm, site blockers, and a big wall calendar to mark streaks. Use the Rule of 3 each day: one task for health, one for money/work, one for relationships.\\n\\nStart small today: throw out the booze/weed, uninstall the games, write your checklist, and take a 10\u2011minute walk. Tomorrow, wake at the same time, do your first 25\u2011minute focused block on a skill, and cook that one meal. If depression is heavy, see a doctor or therapist; it makes everything harder than it needs to be.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need certainty\u2014just a boring plan executed daily.

Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\\n\\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\\n\\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d.

Pick what works for you, leave what doesn\'t. \\n\\nBut remember that you become what you do, only actions are effective. And if you feel like not having the will power to try something you have never tried, it\'s either you evolve trying, or you remain the same. But you can\'t expect different results by repeating the same actions. \\n\\nIt\'s gonna be a beautiful journey, don\'t lose faith in yourself. We all have deamons to fight, keep grinding, keep shining. Peace","percentile_10_comment":"I feel like getting to the heart of your sleep problems will help a lot with almost everything else on this list? Like if you can, find some way to access a sleep specialist, spend some money on it if you can, really try to get a decent sleep schedule. Try everything you can, this matters a lot. \\n\\nSleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won\'t magically fix everything, but I feel like it\'s a good first step.","comment_gpt4o":"Hey there! First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice\u2014acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you\'re juggling a lot, and it\'s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\\n\\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\\n\\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it\'s time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels\u2014there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\\n\\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\\n\\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\\n\\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It\u2019s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\\n\\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\\n\\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You\'ve got this!","comment_gpt5":"31 isn\u2019t late. You don\u2019t need more motivation\u2014you need a few repeatable levers. Try a 14\u2011day stabilization sprint aimed at sleep, one daily win at work, minimum viable study, and clearing the biggest home/finance fires.\\n\\nSleep: pick a non\u2011negotiable wake time (same 7 days), get 10\u201315 min sunlight within 30 minutes of waking, cut caffeine after noon. Nudge bedtime earlier by ~15 minutes every 2\u20133 days. Consider 0.5\u20131 mg melatonin 4\u20136 hours before target bed. If you snore, wake unrefreshed, or can\u2019t lose weight despite eating well, ask your doctor about a sleep study and basic labs (thyroid, iron/ferritin, B12, vitamin D) and revisit ADHD meds with them.\\n\\nWork: each morning write a single deliverable you\u2019ll finish by noon. Do three 25/5 focus cycles with your phone in another room or use Focusmate. At ~3 pm send your manager a short \u201chere\u2019s what I shipped/next/blockers\u201d note. Aim for \u201cgood enough,\u201d not perfect.\\n\\nLaw degree: this week, call your advisor to map the absolute minimum path to graduate in six months and get ADHD accommodations. Then do one 25\u2011minute study block five days a week focused on past exams/active recall. Keep the streak; expand later if you want.\\n\\nHome: nightly 10\u2011minute timer\u2014trash, dishes, laundry, in that order. If it\u2019s really bad, do a one\u2011time 60\u201390 minute \u201ctrash bag sprint\u201d this weekend. If you can swing it, a one\u2011off cleaner is a great reset.\\n\\nFinances: today, set autopay for minimums so nothing goes late. Tomorrow, call collectors and set a small payment plan you can actually keep. Remove saved cards/one\u2011click buys. Do a 10\u2011minute \u201cmoney check\u201d on weekdays to log spending and scan balances.\\n\\nADHD\u2011friendly tactics: externalize everything (whiteboard/sticky notes), body\u2011double (Focusmate/library), time\u2011block the first hour of the day, and use the 10\u2011minute rule when frozen\u2014do ten minutes, then decide to continue.\\n\\nMeetings: jot three points beforehand, speak once in the first five minutes, and ask one clarifying question. Early participation shrinks the anxiety.\\n\\nMake a tiny visible scoreboard: Wake on time, 20\u2011min walk, Work block, Study block, 10\u2011min tidy, Money check. Hit 5/6 most days. If you miss, restart next day\u2014no drama.\\n\\nIf after two weeks you\u2019re still wiped out, push harder on the medical side with your doctor. You\u2019re six months from closing a huge loop\u2014keep it small, repeatable, and visible.

We\'re talking beyond attitude and effort and willpower. It\'s cost me every job and hobby I\'ve ever had and it\'s cost me the love of my life. \\n\\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I\'ve been a game developer for a decade and I\'ve never finished a game.

The trying never lasts long enough. The shame is overwhelming.\\n\\nI\'m sick of not being good at anything. I\'m sick of this abstract baseless fear ruling my life. How the fuck am I supposed to overcome a discipline aversion without discipline?! Has anyone conquered something this deeply rooted? What steps did you take?","comments":{"best_comment":"I looked at how my life was going and instead of getting angry or resentful, I got motivated. I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on \u2014 as you seem to well know. \\n\\nI set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \\n\\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I\u2019m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\\n\\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I\u2019d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don\u2019t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I\u2019d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn\u2019t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn\u2019t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \\n\\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly.

It sounds like you\'re dealing with a pretty tough challenge, but the fact that you\'re reaching out for advice is a great first step. Overcoming a deep-rooted aversion to discipline can be tricky, but it\'s definitely possible with some patience and strategy.\\n\\nFirst, try to reframe how you view discipline. Instead of seeing it as a rigid, external force, think of it as a tool that helps you achieve what you truly want. Start small\u2014pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas. The key is consistency, not intensity.\\n\\nAlso, consider breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Celebrate small wins to build momentum and confidence.\\n\\nIt might also help to find a community or accountability partner who shares your interests. Having someone to share progress with can make the journey feel less isolating and more motivating.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself. Progress isn\'t always linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and remember that every small step forward is a victory.

The trick isn\u2019t more willpower; it\u2019s shrinking the work until it doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cdiscipline\u201d and repeating that tiny dose until the reflex calms down.\\n\\nTry a 30\u2011day sprint with one craft (pick game dev or music, not both). Make a 3\u20135 minute micro\u2011ritual tied to a fixed anchor. For game dev: open the project after coffee, run it, make one shippable change (rename a variable, tweak a value, fix a tiny bug), build, push, stop. For music: metronome at 40 bpm, play one scale once or read four bars of sheet at snail pace, stop. Set a timer and actually stop when it dings. Track with a simple yes/no on a calendar. If you miss, do the next day\u2014never miss twice. When the wall shows up, say \u201cjust the 3\u2011minute version,\u201d start the timer immediately, no debate.\\n\\nAdd one weekly \u201cfinish tiny\u201d rep to build the finishing muscle.

Scope it so it fits in 30\u201360 minutes. Finishing is a skill; train it on trivial scope so it stops triggering the alarm.\\n\\nOutsource discipline with structure. Use body\u2011doubling (Focusmate/Discord coworking), a teacher/coach with tiny assignments, or game jams with strict constraints. Text a friend \u201cdone\u201d after your micro\u2011ritual. Set up the night before so starting is frictionless: instrument out, metronome ready, IDE opens to the right file, build script on a hotkey.\\n\\nKeep the rule: if it starts to feel like \u201cdiscipline,\u201d make it smaller. After a week where it felt easy, nudge the timer up by a minute or two; if it spikes resistance, drop back down. Stop while it still feels safe\u2014leaving a little in the tank makes tomorrow easier.\\n\\nIf this pattern comes from early conditioning, a few sessions with someone who does schema therapy or ACT can help uncouple \u201cdiscipline = threat.\u201d If ADHD is in the mix, keep meds/tools dialed in.\\n\\nGive this 30 days.
