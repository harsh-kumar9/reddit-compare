Need to rewire my brain","body":"I really feel like a complete failure. I Can\u2019t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I\u2019m not as productive as I\u2019d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I\u2019m just so disappointed in my self. It\u2019s hard to drink water. I\u2019m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I\u2019m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I\u2019m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I\u2019m just mad at life. I\u2019m not depressed I\u2019m just disappointed. I\u2019m a ball full of energy. I\u2019m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I\u2019m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I\u2019m a caffeine addict. I don\u2019t know how I will function without my meds when I\u2019m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven\u2019t even gotten my associates degree yet.How do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don\u2019t wanna do. I\u2019m not disciplined. How do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don\u2019t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can\u2019t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I\u2019mTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it","comments":{"best_comment":"Re: the meds part, why?  Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.You wouldn\'t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what\'s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?That\'s how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol","percentile_10_comment":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That\u2019s why you feel like you have no energy.  It\u2019s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it\u2019s worth it.","comment_o3":"I\u2019ve been in a similar loop with ADHD meds, caffeine, lousy food, and guilt, so here\u2019s what\u2019s actually helped me crawl out of the spiral and get some real traction.Treat the medicated and un\u2011medicated days as two different \u201cmodes\u201d with their own expectations. On Vyvanse days aim for the heavy cognitive stuff (studying, trading practice, paperwork) and block it in short \u201cwork sprints\u201d\u201425 minutes of focus, 5 minutes off, three rounds, then a longer break. Put just three must\u2011do items on the schedule; finishing them earns you a win, everything else is extra credit. On off\u2011days switch the goal to recovery and low\u2011bandwidth habits: meal\u2011prep, laundry, a walk, stretching, refilling your water bottle every time you open the fridge. When the bar is realistic you stop burning willpower on beating yourself up.Food: decide it once, not three times a day. Sunday evening plan five simple, repeatable meals you don\u2019t hate (e.g., overnight oats, rotisserie\u2011chicken salad kits, frozen veg + rice + sauce). Prep or portion them right away so \u201cwhat should I eat?\u201d never becomes a question. Store junk food somewhere you\u2019d have to leave the house to get\u2014future\u2011you rarely wants to put on shoes just for Oreos. For water, tie it to something you already do: every bathroom break = 8 oz, every coffee = finish a full bottle first. If plain water is painful, add zero\u2011calorie flavor drops or go bubbly.Movement: 10\u2011minute micro\u2011workouts beat zero\u2011minute perfect workouts. Bodyweight circuits, YouTube yoga, or a brisk walk around the block keep the streak alive on lethargic days and blunt the urge to binge. Momentum matters more than intensity.Phones and dopamine: put your most distracting apps in a folder called \u201cLater\u201d on the last screen, turn on grayscale after 9\xa0p.m., and leave the charger across the room so grabbing the phone is an active choice. When the itch hits, set a 10\u2011minute timer\u2014if you still want to scroll after it rings, go ahead; half the time the urge passes.Plan for the inevitable crash days: write a short rescue checklist (\u201cdrink water, shower, 10\u2011min walk, text a friend\u201d) and tape it where you\u2019ll see it first thing. Following it keeps a bad day from becoming a bad week.Finally, don\u2019t confuse discipline with punishment. You\u2019re not broken; your brain just needs clearer systems than most people\u2019s. Nail one small ritual at a time, celebrate it, then stack the next one on top. Six months of that beats any heroic Monday\u2011morning overhaul. You already care enough to ask for help\u2014that\u2019s the hardest part. Now give yourself permission to improve in boring, unsexy, relentlessly consistent steps. It works.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, you\u2019re not a failure\u2014seriously. You\u2019re juggling a lot, and the fact that you\u2019re self-aware and want to change is a huge step. Discipline isn\u2019t about being perfect or never slipping up; it\u2019s about building systems that help you get back on track when you do. For ADHD and binge eating, it\u2019s extra tough because your brain is wired to chase quick rewards, so you have to outsmart it a bit.Start small. Don\u2019t try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one thing\u2014like drinking more water or eating a better breakfast\u2014and make it your main focus for a week or two. Set reminders on your phone, put a water bottle where you\u2019ll see it, whatever helps. Once that feels more automatic, add something else. For binge eating, try to notice your triggers and swap in a different activity (even just stepping outside or texting a friend) before you eat. It won\u2019t be perfect, but every time you interrupt the cycle, you\u2019re making progress.On days off meds, expect to feel off, but don\u2019t beat yourself up. Plan for lower energy: maybe do a short walk instead of a full workout, or set a timer for 10 minutes of focused work. Even a little bit counts. For focus, try the Pomodoro method (25 minutes on, 5 off) and keep your phone in another room. Motivation comes and goes, but discipline is about showing up even when you don\u2019t feel like it. The more you practice, the easier it gets.If you fall off, just restart. Don\u2019t wait for a new week or month\u2014just pick up where you left off. Progress isn\u2019t linear, and nobody is disciplined 100% of the time. You\u2019re already doing a lot right, so give yourself some credit. Keep showing up, keep tweaking your systems, and over time you\u2019ll build the habits you want. You got this."}},{"id":"t3_ydi7ga","title":"[Need Advice] How do I fix my life","body":"I don\'t really have any friends. I have nojob.

My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I\'ll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I\'m 31 and I don\'t have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn\'t want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn\'t really say other than she didn\'t want anything serious and I was too serious...I wish felt like I was making a difference in people\'s lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don\'t very many other positive habits or routines .

A 10 or 100 small steps in the right direction  will still be 10 or 100 steps better then where you were before.Having said that, make a list of things or goals in major areas of your life physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually. Break these into  20 small actionable steps.E.g Physical goal: Want to get fit? Get up an hour early. Go for a walk, excercise or jog everyday for 30 minutes. Avoid junk food. Eat healthy. If you can do this for a month consistently, you would have done 15 hours of exercise and had an improved diet. Over a long term these add up and count.List down similarly what you can do. In terms if finances, try getting a job. Create a resume. Update it to all job portals. Look an hour for all jobs available and apply. Ask friends for job openings.... you will land something.Try going to mall or retail outlets and look for or ask for job. Everyday have a sense of accomplishment. Try saving one dollar a day, and put it in a jar where it is visible to you....Join a library and read 2-3 pages of a book you like.Listen to uplifting music.Avoid wasting time.Cut negative thinking and be friends and supportive to your self. Everyday try to encourage yourself and do better and be in a better place than yesterday. Remember every step ahead is progress. Believe in yourself. Change your mindset for a better you.

You can do it bro.","comment_o3":"You\u2019re actually sitting on some decent raw materials: decent health, some savings, living parents you still talk to, and a clear sense that what you\u2019re doing now isn\u2019t working. That\u2019s enough to start making deliberate moves instead of drifting. Try treating the next twelve months like a personal turnaround plan with three pillars\u2014income, structure, and community.Income first. Turn job\u2011hunting into a daily habit, not a mood\u2011based activity. Pick a set time each weekday (say 9\u201111am) where the phone goes on airplane mode and you do one thing that moves the ball: tweak the r\xe9sum\xe9, send applications, follow up on an old lead, or take an online micro\u2011course that upgrades a line on your CV. Track it on paper so you can literally see the streak build. Momentum here will reduce a lot of the background anxiety you\u2019ve got about the future.Structure next. You already work out; expand that into a simple morning routine that starts the day on rails: wake at the same time, drink water, make the bed, 15\u2011minute walk, then your workout. Lay clothes out the night before so there\u2019s zero decision fatigue. When the routine becomes automatic you free up willpower for bigger goals.Community last, but crucial. Isolation makes everything else harder. The fastest, cheapest way to get around people who won\u2019t ghost you is volunteering. Animal shelters, food banks, park cleanups\u2014pick something that takes two or three hours a week. You\u2019ll add structure, meet people who value contribution over social polish, and you may stumble into job leads. If you enjoy fitness, consider a group class or even studying for a personal\u2011trainer cert; that turns an existing interest into a social and possibly paid activity.Expect awkwardness at first. Do it anyway, log it, and see how you feel after thirty days. If emotions stay rough, add a therapist to the mix; savings are well spent on getting your mind running clean.The short version: one disciplined job\u2011search block a day, one locked\u2011in morning routine, one weekly commitment that puts you around other humans. Keep those promises to yourself for a quarter and your life will look noticeably different\u2014maybe not \u201cfixed,\u201d but moving, and that\u2019s what counts. Good luck, man; twelve months of consistent basics can erase a lot of messy years.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, you\u2019re not alone in feeling lost at 31\u2014plenty of people are still figuring things out, and it\u2019s not too late to make changes. The fact that you\u2019re physically active is a solid foundation, so give yourself credit for that. If you want to start building a life you\u2019re proud of, try focusing on small, consistent actions. For example, set a simple daily routine: wake up at the same time, get some sunlight, do your fitness thing, and add one new habit (like reading for 10 minutes, journaling, or applying to one job a day). Don\u2019t worry about making friends or finding a relationship right away\u2014those things tend to come when you\u2019re working on yourself and putting yourself out there, even in small ways. Volunteering or joining a local club can help you meet people and feel like you\u2019re making a difference, even if it\u2019s just a couple hours a week. Progress is slow and sometimes boring, but if you stick with the basics and keep showing up, things will start to shift.

Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it\'s questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)That\'s what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I\'m no therapist. I\'m just sharing what has worked for me.2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I\'m my own daughter. No, I\'m not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it\'s hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.Good luck!","percentile_10_comment":"Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don\'t suppress it, it will just bottle up and that\'s not good. Writing things helps me see it as it is and not with emotions but with logic and rationale.","comment_o3":"I used to think the answer was to shut feelings down, but that\u2019s like trying to hold a beach ball underwater\u2014it works until it doesn\u2019t. The trick is separating the moment you feel an emotion from the moment you act on it. One simple way is the \u201cpause and label\u201d habit: when something hits you, name the emotion out loud or in writing (\u201cthat\u2019s anger,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s disappointment\u201d). The tiny act of labeling moves the experience from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, giving you a short window to think instead of react.While you\u2019re in that window, run a preset protocol rather than ad\u2011libbing. Mine is a notebook page with three questions: What exactly happened? What do I want to do right now? What would I tell a friend to do? Writing it forces me to translate raw feelings into concrete statements, and looking at that third answer often exposes the gap between impulse and wisdom. If I\u2019m still unsure, I wait 24 hours before taking any irreversible action\u2014love confessions, angry emails, quitting a job, whatever. Most emotional whiplash cools off in a day; if it still feels right after the wait, I trust it more.Build a daily practice that trains this skill when the stakes are low. Ten minutes of mindfulness meditation or breath counting literally rewires the brain for better impulse control; five minutes of journaling each morning keeps a running log of patterns that cloud your judgment. Physical outlets help too\u2014lifting, running, even walks\u2014because a calm nervous system is easier to reason with.Finally, decide once, not every time. For recurring situations (dating red flags, spending limits, staying up late), write a short set of personal policies while you\u2019re calm. Next time your emotions flare, the decision is already made and you just follow the policy, no debate required.You\u2019re not weak for feeling things strongly; you just need a system that catches the emotion, channels it, and lets logic have its say. Give the above a 30\u2011day trial, track your results, and adjust. It\u2019s work, but it beats letting every spike of feeling steer the wheel.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, learning to manage emotions so they don\u2019t hijack your decisions is a skill, and it takes practice like any other. One thing that helps is building a habit of pausing before reacting\u2014literally taking a few deep breaths or even stepping away for a few minutes when you feel a strong emotion. This gives your logical brain a chance to catch up. Journaling can also be useful: write down what you\u2019re feeling and what you think the logical action is, then revisit it after some time has passed. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and get better at separating what you want to do in the moment from what\u2019s actually best for you. It\u2019s not about suppressing emotions, but about acknowledging them without letting them run the show. If you keep practicing this pause-and-reflect habit, it\u2019ll get easier to make decisions that align with your long-term goals instead of just your immediate feelings. Hang in there\u2014it\u2019s a process, but it\u2019s definitely doable."}},{"id":"t3_xc1fsf","title":"[Need advice] Scared of making any attempt so I procrastinate","body":"So, what I\u2019ve noticed is that I get very scared to do anything with studying or homework. I just get scared to even make an attempt at things\u2026 Usually, when it\u2019s the day something is due, that fear of getting a bad grade overcomes that fear of making an attempt at doing things. It\u2019s struggle though, and I end up hurting a lot. I\u2019m just wondering about how I can just do things with school even if there is no due date to scare me into trying even though I get so afraid to (because I want to get things done earlier and not last second) I just don\u2019t know how to get over that fear of doing anything at all, of even making an attempt\u2026..It\u2019s not that I just want to play games or do something else, it\u2019s just fear of doing it at all\u2026..","comments":{"best_comment":"I don\'t know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.In my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I\'m not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn\'t even went to give my exams Firstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% So whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. If you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don\'t  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don\'t distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. Now you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I\'m gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it.

I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. It\'s not like I didn\'t try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn\'t even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that\'s worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. I have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I\'m tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can\'t even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head.

Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you\'re most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.Life is short, but it\'s longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone\'s success (except the very lucky) is consistency.Figure out what you want - it doesn\'t have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \\"to travel the world\\" or \\"to buy a house\\" or \\"get married and raise a family\\" or as simple as \\"get a job that lets you live comfortably\\". Figure out what it is.Consistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what\'s important to you and start today, then do it every day.Break down the goal into smaller chunks - if it\'s get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it\'s getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. The secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That\'s okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.And if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

Assess my current situation2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self3. Create SMART goals 4. Do a daily review of the day**Assess the situation**.  This is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  I started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  Infrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  Then i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  After that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.This gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we\'re the biggest issues in my life.**Map out your ideal self**  I basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.&#x200B;**SMART Goals**  Way to many times I\'ve created goals and never followed up.

Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   **Daily Review**  The hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I\'ve set up for myself.  So these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

Pick one small win in each area you care about\u2014work, health, social\u2014and protect 30\u201360 minutes a day for them.Work: Admin coordinator gives you a ton of transferable skills (organization, scheduling, spreadsheets, communication). Pick one that pays better and double down. For example, take a free Google Project Management or Data Analytics cert on Coursera. Do 30 minutes after work, five days a week, and keep a simple log so you can see hours pile up. Six months of steady half\u2011hours is 60+ hours\u2014enough to finish a cert and update your r\xe9sum\xe9.Health/energy: Do something that moves your body but doesn\u2019t drain willpower. A 15\u2011minute walk before breakfast or after work is enough to boost mood and confidence, and it doesn\u2019t require gear or a gym. If you feel like doing more, great, but the rule is \u201cnever zero.\u201dSocial: You already enrolled in dance\u2014perfect. Before each class set a tiny target like saying \u201cHey, how long have you been dancing?\u201d to one person. Same question every time if you want. Consistency beats cleverness; if you speak to one new person each class, you\u2019ll have talked to 20 by the end of a month.Track these three things in a notebook or app with a simple \u2714\ufe0f each day. Seeing streaks grow is its own motivation and a reminder that you\u2019re not \u201ca failure\u201d; you\u2019re a person who shows up. In a year the compounding looks like: a marketable cert, better energy, and a network of dancers who know your name. That\u2019s a solid foundation to keep stacking on.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, signing up for a dance class is a great step\u2014seriously, putting yourself out there like that takes guts. When it comes to overhauling your life, it can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. Instead, pick one small thing you want to improve and focus on building a daily habit around it. For example, if you want to work on your career, maybe set aside 20 minutes a day to research jobs, learn a new skill online, or update your resume. If you want to make more friends, challenge yourself to say hi to one new person each week at your class. The key is consistency, not perfection. Progress is slow at first, but it adds up. Also, don\u2019t underestimate the value of your current experience\u2014admin skills are useful in a ton of fields, and you can always build on them. Start small, keep showing up, and give yourself credit for every step forward, no matter how minor it feels.

I\'ll not get too much into it but I\'m miserable during the weekdays. I\'m also in a new job so I\'m constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here\'s what my week looks like - Monday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it\'s time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. I want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. My current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I\'ve been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.How do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","comments":{"best_comment":"I personally don\'t think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that\'s the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn\'t have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.I can\'t speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","percentile_10_comment":"You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).","comment_o3":"Been there during the peak of lockdown \u2013 weekdays felt like an airport lounge where I was just killing time until the flight to Friday. A few changes pulled me out of that loop.First, put a fence around work. WFH blurs the edges, so you have to draw them yourself. Decide a hard shut\u2011down time (say 7\xa0pm), put it in your calendar, tell your manager you\u2019ll be offline after that unless there\u2019s an emergency, then actually close the laptop and put it in a drawer. Most bosses won\u2019t push back if you\u2019re delivering; the boundary forces you to work with more intention and keeps the evenings clear for life.Second, treat each weekday like a mini\u2011weekend by scheduling one small \u201canchor\u201d you genuinely look forward to. Could be a 30\u2011minute guitar lesson on Monday night, a pick\u2011up basketball game on Tuesday, a fancy coffee and a book on Wednesday morning, whatever. When there\u2019s something positive waiting at 6\xa0pm, the day stops feeling like an endurance test.Third, give your body a reason to get out of bed. Set the alarm for the same time every day, get vertical immediately (phone across the room helps), splash water on your face and step outside for 2 minutes of sunlight or a daylight lamp. Follow it with 5\u201310 push\u2011ups, squats, or stretching. Tiny, but it signals to your brain that the day has started and it\u2019s no longer sleep time.Fourth, clean up the coping loop with food by changing the environment, not your willpower. Keep trigger snacks out of the house, prep easy high\u2011protein meals on Sunday so Weekday\u2011You doesn\u2019t have to think, and put fruit or nuts where the chips used to be. If the only \u201clazy\u201d option is something decent, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll eat.Finally, don\u2019t try to make peace with a 40\u2011year sentence. Think in 3\u2011month experiments. \u201cFor the next quarter I\u2019ll hold a 7\xa0pm work curfew, lift on M/W/F, and practice Spanish T/Th for 20 minutes.\u201d Review, tweak, repeat. Careers, companies, and you will all change many times before retirement. Your job is to build routines and skills that travel with you.Weekends will still be fun, they just won\u2019t be the only time you feel alive. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, a lot of people fall into the \u201cliving for the weekend\u201d trap, especially with WFH blurring the lines between work and life. The first thing to realize is that you don\u2019t have to accept that this is how it\u2019ll be for the next 40 years\u2014things can change, but it takes small, intentional steps. One thing that helps is building little rituals or activities during the week that you actually look forward to, even if they\u2019re minor. It could be a walk after work, a hobby you do for 30 minutes, or even just making a good cup of coffee and reading something you enjoy. The point is to break up the monotony and give yourself something to anticipate that isn\u2019t just the weekend.About the work stress and underperforming: try setting a clear \u201cend\u201d to your workday, even if it\u2019s just shutting your laptop and physically moving to a different space. It\u2019s easy to let work bleed into your whole day, but having a hard stop can help your brain switch gears. If you\u2019re worried about performance, pick one or two small, concrete things to improve each week instead of trying to overhaul everything at once.For the food and sleep stuff, it\u2019s worth experimenting with a morning routine that gets you out of bed for something other than work\u2014maybe a quick walk, stretching, or even just sitting by a window with music. The goal isn\u2019t to be super productive, but to give your mind a reason to get up that isn\u2019t just obligation.You don\u2019t have to love every day, but you can make them less miserable by sprinkling in small things you enjoy and setting boundaries around work. Over time, those little changes add up and make the weeks feel less like something to \u201cget through.\u201d Hang in there\u2014it\u2019s possible to build a life where you don\u2019t dread Monday through Thursday."}},{"id":"t3_v8z22p","title":"[Need Advice] How do you stop depression from stopping you?","body":"Hi guys,I\u2019m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It\u2019s bad because i\u2019ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I\u2019ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it\u2019s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can\u2019t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can\u2019t do this.But I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don\u2019t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.For any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.Edit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)","comments":{"best_comment":"Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. One thing I will say is that it\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It\u2019s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to be ok, and it does get better. For myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can\u2019t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.","percentile_10_comment":"Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. I\u2019m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that\u2019s making you feel bad. But it\u2019s a good place to start when trying to get on track. Protect your sleep. Do that by:- Going to bed at the same time every night. - Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you\u2019re not really doing anything in that hour.)Also, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don\u2019t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you\u2019ve lost all progress when you screw up once. Protecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.","comment_o3":"What helped me stick with a similar \u201cmental\u2011health first\u201d routine was treating each habit like brushing my teeth: not negotiable, but the intensity can vary day to day. I planned a tiny, can\u2019t\u2011fail version of every task\u2014five minutes of the program, two minutes of meditation, ten push\u2011ups or a short walk, walking into the corner store to buy gum. On good days I often did more, but if my mood cratered I could still hit the minimum and keep the streak alive. That one change killed the all\u2011or\u2011nothing thinking that used to send me spiraling.I put every task in my calendar with alarms and labelled them \u201cappointments.\u201d The less deciding I do in the moment, the less my brain can negotiate. Habit\u2011tracking apps like Loop (Android) or Streaks (iOS) give you a satisfying visual chain; I check mine off immediately afterward so the reward is instant. If you like gamification, Habitica turns your tasks into an RPG and has guilds for social anxiety where people cheer each other on.Accountability multiplies discipline, so I post my daily checklist in a small Discord with two friends. If I don\u2019t report by 10\xa0p.m. they ping me. You can get a similar effect from r/90daygoal or the daily threads here.Finally, expect the occasional miss. One slip isn\u2019t a relapse; it\u2019s a data point. When it happens I write down what tripped me up, adjust tomorrow\u2019s plan, and move on. Consistency beats perfection, and the fact that you\u2019ve already stuck with the program for a month shows you have the chops to do this. Good luck\u2014you start again every morning, and that\u2019s a powerful advantage.","comment_gpt4dot1":"First off, huge respect for sticking with your program for a month\u2014that\u2019s not easy, especially with social anxiety and depression in the mix. One thing that helped me was lowering the bar for what \u201ccounts\u201d as a win, especially on tough days. If you can\u2019t do the full workout, just put on your shoes and stretch for five minutes. If going into a store feels impossible, maybe just walk to the door or even around the block. The key is to keep the streak alive, even if it\u2019s a tiny version of the habit. I also found it helpful to use a habit tracker app (like Habitica or Streaks) because seeing the chain grow is motivating, and it\u2019s less about perfection and more about consistency. If you miss a day, don\u2019t let it spiral\u2014just get back to it the next day. Communities like this sub or even small Discord groups can help with accountability, but ultimately, being kind to yourself and focusing on progress over perfection is what keeps you going.

Pick one direction that feels promising\u2014physical sciences, for example, since that was the last time you remember genuine interest\u2014and give it a six\u2011month sprint. During that time build a simple, repeatable routine: spend an hour a day on foundational study, an hour on a hands\u2011on side project (could be a small electronics kit, a data\u2011analysis notebook, a short explanatory video), and finish each session by writing two sentences about what felt energizing and what felt draining. At the three\u2011month mark reread those notes. If your average day still feels like the \u201cdry hole,\u201d pivot to the next experiment on the list. If the notes are trending positive, double down for another six months.Two rules keep the process honest: cap your experiments at one or two simultaneous commitments so you don\u2019t spread thin, and make sure each one ends with something concrete you can show\u2014an Arduino gadget, a Medium article, a five\u2011minute explainer on YouTube. Tangible outputs give you real feedback and build a portfolio at the same time.You already like problem\u2011solving and reaching people, so look for intersections: science communication, data journalism, user\u2011research inside tech, or even product management where micro\u2011economics, psychology, and design all collide. Those fields reward honesty and have broad impact, which matches your values. And if you still want to try the self\u2011help or daily\u2011routine channel, run it the same way: schedule six weeks, script ten short videos, post them on a fixed cadence, then review the numbers and your own enthusiasm before deciding whether to scale.Discipline here isn\u2019t about iron willpower; it\u2019s about building a small structure that makes these experiments automatic. Block the time on your calendar, set a visible tracker on your wall, and commit to not breaking the chain for the full sprint.

If you\u2019re looking for a sense of purpose, sometimes it helps to focus less on finding a single \u201cpassion\u201d and more on building habits around things you\u2019re curious about\u2014even if they don\u2019t feel like a grand calling yet. For example, if physical sciences were the last thing you felt genuinely interested in, maybe set aside a small, consistent block of time each week to dive back in\u2014read, take an online course, or even join a local group if that\u2019s an option. Over time, discipline in exploring these interests can help you rediscover what excites you, and you might find new angles you hadn\u2019t considered before.Also, since you value honesty and connecting with people, maybe try combining those with your skills\u2014like making content that helps others learn or solve problems (self-help, routines, or even breaking down complex topics in a relatable way).

What matters now is what you do with the energy that\u2019s sloshing around after that loss. Discipline is really just the habit of directing that energy on purpose instead of letting it leak everywhere.Start by giving your days a basic structure. Wake\u2011up time, bed time, three meals, some movement, something productive, something genuinely relaxing. If you nail the fundamentals\u2014sleep, decent food, exercise\u2014you\u2019ll be shocked how much emotional turbulence settles on its own. Pick one anchor habit that you can hit no matter what: a 30\u2011minute walk every morning, a short lift session after work, whatever is sustainable. Treat that habit like brushing your teeth: non\u2011negotiable.Next, train the mind the same way you\u2019re training the body. Ten minutes of meditation, or even just sitting with a notebook and dumping all the messy thoughts onto paper, will teach you to watch emotions instead of being yanked around by them. Pair that with some Stoic or CBT\u2011style reflection: ask yourself, \u201cIs this feeling helpful?

Think of it as hiring a personal trainer for your head.Finally, remember that discipline isn\u2019t about becoming a stoic robot. It\u2019s about having enough control that you can choose when to be open and when to be reserved. You\u2019re already on that path by asking for help.

The best way to start is small\u2014pick one daily habit that you can control, like making your bed every morning or going for a short walk. These little wins build up your confidence and show your mind that you can stick to things. When it comes to emotions, you don\u2019t have to shut them off, but you can practice not reacting right away. If you feel something intense, give yourself a few minutes before you act or respond.

I\u2019m 24 y/o and never went through high school.I grew up in a Christian homeschooled household and to make a very long story short, since middle school my parents never kept me accountable with my school work. I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off. That coupled with my parents never checking up on how I was doing/if I was completing my schoolwork, my education just slipped through the cracks. I started working and moved out when I was 17. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been till now. I honestly don\u2019t remember what grade I got to in school before I dropped out, I\u2019m assuming 6th or 7th. Now that I\u2019m nearing my mid twenties I\u2019m realizing I\u2019d like to go to college in spring of 2024 but I have no idea where to even start. I was hoping I could get some advice on first steps. I know I need to get GED but where do I go for that? Is there a program for people like me? Am I too far gone? Please help.","comments":{"best_comment":"Hit up your local community college and tell an entrance counselor you need to take some assessment tests due to non-traditional schooling.  I guarantee you they\u2019ve heard this story before and they will help you figure out what remedial courses are necessary.  Also ask how to get assessed for learning disabilities so you can get accommodations as necessary.","percentile_10_comment":"Yo homie I also didn\'t get past 7th grade, I got my GED at 30, then started college 2 years after that. I\'m an engineer now. It\'s possible for you as well, learn about passing the GED as an exam instead of trying to learn what\'s on it (the big books the give you are intimidating), being in college is rewarding as you are around people motivated to learn. Community college will be a better resource at first until you are ready to transfer to a university.","comment_o3":"You\u2019re not too far gone at all\u201424 is a perfectly normal age to be figuring this out and people ten, twenty, even thirty years older than you do it every year. The short version of the process is: get the GED, use it to enroll in community college, then transfer or continue from there.  First step: make an account on GED.com. That site is run by the company that administers the test, and it walks you through registration, state\u2011specific rules, testing centers, fees, and free practice questions. Take the diagnostic quizzes right away; they\u2019ll show where you\u2019re strong and where you need work, which keeps your study time focused instead of random.  Next, call or email the nearest community college\u2019s \u201cadult education\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d department. Almost every state funds free or very low\u2011cost GED prep classes\u2014many meet at night or online and include tutors. If you suspect a learning disability, tell them; the GED has official accommodations (extra time, private room, etc.) and colleges often have disability services that can help you document and receive them.  Now the discipline piece: treat studying like a shift at work. Pick a specific block of time you can defend\u2014say 7\u20139\xa0p.m. on weeknights\u2014and sit in the same spot with your phone on airplane mode until the block is over. Start each session by writing the single topic you\u2019ll cover (e.g., \u201cfractions\u201d or \u201csocial studies practice test\u201d) at the top of a sheet of paper and end by jotting what to tackle tomorrow, so you never waste time wondering what\u2019s next. Khan Academy, GED Flash, and plenty of YouTube channels cover everything for free; the key is consistency, not perfect resources. Aim for four or five study blocks a week and track them on a calendar so you can see the streak grow.  Once your GED practice scores are comfortably above passing, schedule the real exams one at a time. Passing all four subjects instantly makes you eligible for federal financial aid; fill out the FAFSA as soon as it opens in October and apply to the community college for Spring 2024 admission. They\u2019ll likely give you a placement test and, if needed, remedial math or English courses\u2014which is normal and nothing to be embarrassed about.  The plan is straightforward: GED account tonight, call the adult\u2011ed office tomorrow, study on a fixed schedule, knock out the four exams, file FAFSA, enroll. Keep your daily study habit small but non\u2011negotiable, and the months between now and spring will be more than enough. You\u2019ve already done the hardest part by deciding to act; now it\u2019s just reps. You got this.","comment_gpt4dot1":"You\u2019re definitely not too far gone, and honestly, you\u2019re not alone\u2014lots of people have gaps in their education for all kinds of reasons. The good news is, there\u2019s a clear path forward. First, look up GED prep programs in your area\u2014public libraries, community colleges, and adult education centers often offer free or low-cost classes. There are also online resources (like Khan Academy, GED.com, and YouTube channels) that can help you brush up on the basics at your own pace. Once you feel ready, you can register for the GED test through GED.com, which will guide you to official testing centers near you. As for discipline, try setting a simple daily study routine, even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes a day to start. Track your progress and celebrate small wins\u2014consistency is way more important than cramming. If you hit a wall, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help\u2014there are tons of online forums and local tutors who can support you. Getting your GED is 100% doable, and it\u2019s a solid first step toward college. You\u2019ve already done the hardest part by deciding to change things.

Sometimes your brain just needs to reset. After that, try switching up your study routine: shorter sessions, changing locations, or even studying with a friend can help. If lectures are draining, maybe skim the material beforehand so you\u2019re not going in cold, or focus on active recall instead of just copying notes. Also, make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep, eating decently, and moving your body a bit\u2014basic stuff, but it makes a huge difference. Coffee loses its magic if you rely on it too much, so maybe cut back for a bit and see if your natural energy comes back. Burnout is real, but it\u2019s not permanent.

Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don\'t know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \\"I didn\'t have much more to say\\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn\'t write her and she didn\'t write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it\'s something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.**Two minors issues*** **First of all, I don\'t like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\\\--\x3e This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn\'t went to gym anymore for years).* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\\\--\x3e Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)   **My two biggest issues*** **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\\\--\x3e For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn\'t message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it\'s really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \\"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\\" and the thought really really scares me.   * **Dating** \\\\--\x3e In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it\'s exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don\'t want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \\"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).   **I really don\'t know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share.

When you try to twist four or five knobs simultaneously (gym, alcohol, porn, dating, school) you run out of willpower fast, relapse on one, then feel like the whole panel exploded. Pick the single habit that would make everything else easier and nail it for 60\u201190 days. For most people in your situation that\u2019s consistent exercise because it\u2019s an anchor: it floods you with endorphins, regulates sleep, gives you something to do when urges hit, and grows self\u2011respect. Your plan can be as simple as three strength workouts and two 30\u2011minute walks per week, booked on your calendar like classes you can\u2019t skip. When you\u2019re sick or busy, keep the streak alive with an ultra\u2011tiny version\u2014five minutes of push\u2011ups or stretching counts. The goal is \u201cnever zero,\u201d not \u201cperfect session.\u201d Once that\u2019s automated you\u2019ll be surprised how much easier it is to drink less, study better, and resist porn because your brain already has a daily win.For alcohol, decide your rule before you enter the bar: \u201cno drinks\u201d or \u201ctwo and done.\u201d Announce it to the friend who will actually call you on it, not the one who buys rounds. Order a soda with lime as soon as you arrive so your hands aren\u2019t empty. Track nights alcohol\u2011free on a calendar; watching a streak grow scratches the same dopamine itch drinking used to.Porn is a stimulus\u2011response loop like any other. Remove the stimulus (blockers, phone out of bedroom, no screens after 11), replace the response (cold shower, short walk, text a friend) and expect withdrawal waves for two weeks. When you slip\u2014and you will\u2014label it data, not failure. Note the trigger, adjust the environment, start the streak counter at one again. That mental reset is the real skill you\u2019re practicing.Dating can wait. You\u2019re about to switch countries twice; that\u2019s enough novelty. Give yourself permission to focus on friendships, study, and the habits above until you land in the exchange semester. Loneliness won\u2019t kill you; chasing new matches while you\u2019re unstable might. If someone amazing crosses your path organically, great, but deleting the apps removes the \u201cshould I swipe?\u201d bandwidth tax and lets you prove to yourself that you can be content solo.Finally, therapy usually feels unproductive right before the real work starts. If you can afford it, commit to another ten sessions and treat it like training, not chatting. Show up with a written agenda of what happened, what you tried, what didn\u2019t work. That alone makes it feel practical.TL;DR: pick exercise as your keystone habit, guard it like a class, layer in alcohol rules, treat porn slips as data, pause the dating apps, and give therapy another structured shot. Stack small, repeatable wins and the darker thoughts lose their grip.

Instead of going all-in and burning out, try to make exercise a non-negotiable part of your week, even if it\u2019s just a quick walk or a short workout when you\u2019re busy or sick.

Breaking a porn addiction\u2014especially when it\u2019s tied to specific fantasies\u2014can be tough, but it\u2019s definitely possible with some structure and patience. The first step is to recognize your triggers. If you\u2019re watching during lectures or before bed, try to change up your routine: keep your phone in another room during study time, and set a strict bedtime routine that doesn\u2019t involve screens. Replace the habit with something else\u2014reading, journaling, or even listening to music or a podcast can help distract your mind before sleep. It might also help to set small, realistic goals, like going one day without porn, then two, and so on. Track your progress and reward yourself for milestones. If you slip up, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just get back on track. If you\u2019re comfortable, consider talking to a counselor or therapist, especially since this is affecting your confidence and studies. You\u2019re working on your master\u2019s, which is a big deal, so try to focus on your long-term goals and remind yourself why you want to make this change.

You need to force yourself to do things you don\u2019t enjoy because you know that its for your own benefit anyway.Force yourself to study for 10-15 minutes at a time.  Do this multiple times a day, whether you feel like it or not.Soon the habit of studying starts to form and then you will be studying more often and it won\u2019t seem so unpleasant after a while.But this doesn\u2019t happen overnight.

When you can actually see the board you won\u2019t have that built\u2011in excuse to drift off.In class, keep doing what already worked: jot quick keywords, not full sentences, then Google or review them during a designated study block later. If writing everything feels heavy, set a tiny floor: commit to writing just one keyword per slide or five per lesson. Once you\u2019re moving, momentum usually carries you.To stay present, run mini Pomodoros during lectures: tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019ll lock in for the next ten minutes, then I\u2019m allowed a 30\u2011second stretch or doodle.\u201d Short, timed focus sprints give your brain something concrete to beat instead of a vague \u201cpay attention all period.\u201dPut obstacles in front of the easy distractions.

Sit nearer to the front so daydreaming feels more obvious.When your mind inevitably wanders, don\u2019t fight it\u2014just note the thought in the margin, then bring your eyes back up. Treat it like mental push\u2011ups; every rep strengthens focus.After school, spend ten minutes rewriting or expanding the keywords into proper notes while the material is still fresh. Ten minutes is short enough that you\u2019ll actually start; once you\u2019re in motion you\u2019ll probably go longer.Stack a small reward to the end of that study block\u2014playlist, snack, quick game\u2014so your brain associates \u201cdid the work\u201d with \u201cgood thing happens.\u201dFinally, expect slip\u2011ups.

Once you do that, let yourself stop if you want, but chances are you\u2019ll keep going. Also, if you catch yourself daydreaming, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just gently bring your focus back. It helps to set up little rewards for yourself after you finish a class or a study session, even if it\u2019s just a 5-minute break or a snack. Over time, these small actions add up and make it easier to stay focused. And if your vision is making things tough, maybe talk to your teacher about sitting closer or getting materials in a format that\u2019s easier for you to read.

Consistency rewires your brain faster than marathon sessions do. While you\u2019ve got a year, choose a free online course (Coursera, Khan, edX) that\u2019s close to what you\u2019ll face in school and move through it slowly. Watch a short lecture, close the video, and test yourself from memory before looking at your notes; active recall beats rereading for long\u2011term retention. When you want to keep facts, drop them into Anki or another spaced\u2011repetition app and run the deck for five minutes a day.  Use a simple Pomodoro timer\u201425 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes of walking or stretching\u2014to train attention stamina. If you complete two Pomodoros, log it in a notebook; the growing chain of checkmarks is its own motivator.

Over time, you\u2019ll slide up to two hours of honest focus without realizing it.  Finally, nail down the logistical stuff that trips returning students: a clutter\u2011free desk, cloud backups for notes, keyboard shortcuts, and a calendar that auto\u2011reminds you of deadlines. The technical friction you remove now is energy you\u2019ll keep for harder material later. Millions of people go back to school in mid\u2011life and crush it; the ones who stick with a simple, repeatable routine end up feeling like they never left.

The good news is that studying is a skill you can rebuild with practice. Start small: pick a subject or topic you\u2019re interested in (even if it\u2019s not related to your future studies) and set aside 20-30 minutes a day to read, take notes, or summarize what you\u2019ve learned. The key is consistency, not intensity at first. Try experimenting with different study methods\u2014like active recall (quizzing yourself), spaced repetition, or teaching the material to someone else (even if it\u2019s just out loud to yourself). Over time, gradually increase your study sessions and try to mimic the kind of work you\u2019ll be doing in school, like writing short essays or solving problems. Also, pay attention to your environment\u2014find a spot with minimal distractions and set a regular study time to build the habit. Don\u2019t stress about being perfect; the goal is to make studying a normal part of your routine again so it feels less overwhelming when classes start.

If you really want this then it can be extremely helpful to know why, exactly, you want it.","comment_o3":"Complacency creeps in when the next step isn\u2019t obvious or urgent, so the first move is to give your growth an address: pick one area you genuinely care about and define a clear, measurable target. \u201cRead more\u201d becomes \u201cfinish 12 non\u2011fiction books this year,\u201d \u201cget fitter\u201d becomes \u201crun 5\xa0km in under 30\xa0minutes.\u201d Specificity creates friction against drifting.Once the target is concrete, forget about motivation and build a process that makes the next action automatic. Decide when, where, and for how long you\u2019ll work on it, put it on your calendar, and treat that block like an appointment you can\u2019t miss. If you can\u2019t see exactly when you\u2019ll practice, you\u2019ll default to someday\u2014which is when complacency loves to visit.To push your comfort zone without burning out, use the 85\xa0% rule: most of the time stay in tasks you can do fairly well, but carve out 15\xa0% of each session for something that\u2019s just beyond your current ability. That sweet spot feels awkward enough to trigger growth but not so hard that you quit.Track progress visibly\u2014whiteboard, habit app, notebook, whatever you\u2019ll actually look at. A streak counter or progress graph creates tiny hits of momentum and makes plateaus obvious before they turn into months of inertia. If the numbers stop moving, tighten the feedback loop: shorter cycles of plan\u2011do\u2011review, maybe weekly instead of monthly.Accountability multiplies discipline.

One thing that helps is to set specific, challenging (but realistic) goals that push you just a bit beyond your current abilities.

Track your progress, even if it\u2019s just a daily or weekly check-in, so you can see that you\u2019re moving forward. Also, try to regularly expose yourself to new experiences or skills, even if they\u2019re unrelated to your main goals\u2014this keeps your brain in \u201clearning mode\u201d and makes it easier to get out of your comfort zone. Lastly, remember that discipline isn\u2019t about feeling motivated all the time; it\u2019s about building routines that make growth automatic.

WHAT DO I DO?!You might be wondering how this happened...well...I have a severe hentai addiction.

I\'ve tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \\"content\\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.Another problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.Even when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep.

Go to your school\u2019s advising or registrar office tomorrow, in person, and ask about a late withdrawal or leave of absence for last semester. Schools usually have a process that lets you wipe F\u2019s off the transcript if you can document a medical/mental\u2011health issue; at worst they can tell you the deadline and your exact GPA situation so you know what you\u2019re dealing with. While you\u2019re there, ask what would happen to your scholarship if you sit out a semester\u2014get facts before making the decision. That information will make the conversation with your dad and the scholarship provider a lot easier, because you can present a plan instead of just a confession: \u201cI had a rough first semester, I\u2019ve spoken with the school, I\u2019m taking a leave/retaking the classes, here\u2019s the timeline and what I\u2019m doing to fix it.\u201dSecond, treat the porn loop like any other compulsive behavior: remove frictionless access and add frictionless alternatives. Put your gaming PC/console in a common area or box it up and leave it at a friend\u2019s for a month. Install blocking software that only a friend has the password to. Use your phone or a library computer for schoolwork so you can\u2019t alter the blocker. When the urge hits, stand up, leave the room, and do ten push\u2011ups, walk outside, or open your textbook\u2014teach your brain that the cue leads somewhere else. If you relapse, no moral drama; log it and reset the counter.Third, shrink your study sessions to something you cannot refuse. Literally set a timer for five minutes, open the syllabus, and start. When five minutes are up you can quit\u2014most of the time you\u2019ll keep going. Pair that with a hard daily cutoff: once it\u2019s 6\xa0p.m. you\u2019re done for the day, no guilt, which prevents the \u201cI wasted the morning so the day is ruined\u201d spiral.Fourth, get humans involved. Book an appointment with campus counseling (or a local therapist if you pause school). Tell one friend what you\u2019re trying to fix and text them a photo of your study space each time you start a session\u2014accountability doesn\u2019t have to be deep, it just has to exist.Taking a semester off can work if you treat it like rehab, not vacation: structured schedule, part\u2011time job for routine, counseling, daily exercise, and clocked study blocks to retake or prep classes. Gather the facts from your school first, then decide. Whatever you choose, move on it this week\u2014the sooner you act, the smaller the mess gets.

The most important thing is to face what\u2019s happening head-on, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. For your dad and the scholarship, honesty (without oversharing) is usually the best policy. You can say you struggled with motivation and time management, and you\u2019re working on getting help and making changes. It\u2019s better than letting them find out on their own or making excuses that fall apart later.About the addiction and procrastination: blockers and willpower alone rarely work long-term. The key is to change your environment and routines so it\u2019s harder to fall into old habits. If your computer is the main trigger, try moving it to a more public space or limiting your access to it during certain hours. Replace the \u201cpleasure-then-game\u201d cycle with something else\u2014literally anything that gets you out of your room and moving, even if it\u2019s just a walk or a quick workout. The urge to wander or nap when you\u2019re supposed to work is super common; it\u2019s your brain dodging discomfort. Try the \u201c2-minute rule\u201d from Atomic Habits: commit to just two minutes of the task, then see if you can keep going. Sometimes just starting is the hardest part.As for skipping the semester, that\u2019s a big decision. If you\u2019re truly not ready and you have the option, taking a break to reset can help, but only if you use that time to actually work on your habits and mental health\u2014not just to escape. If you stay, set super small, realistic goals for each day, and don\u2019t expect perfection.

Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Reddit, becoming increasingly awake and energetic till 2am, effectively ruining my next day. Why is this happening ? How can I stop this?Update: Thank you for insightful comments and great recommendations! I am super grateful for the effort that you guys have put in your replies. I\u2019ve learnt new perspectives from every single comment. This is awesome. Thank you once again \ud83e\udd70To summarize 1) Go on dopamine fasting. Rewire my brain to get used to lower doses of dopamine hit. Swear off social media2) Replace downtime with something constructive, that I can grow over time. Be deliberate about what the replacement activities are before going on dopamine fast. Examples of replacement activities are reading, journaling, exercising, learning a new language, trying to make art\u20263) Examine what is causing me to get into social media apps, beyond the dopamine factor. Social media is not my support network. Few books mentioned are Wilpower instinct, Atomic habits, Digital Minimization, the Molecule of more 4) Out of sight out of mind. Keep the phone away, set limits on usage, put on grey mode, tell my brain that I am not missing out anything.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day\'s productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.","percentile_10_comment":"I\u2019m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary \u2018A Social Dilemma\u2019. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it\u2019s akin to slot machines. Here\u2019s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\u201cEach time you\u2019re swiping down, it\u2019s like a slot machine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. Sometimes it\u2019s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it\u2019s just an ad.\u201d What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.This feeds into the \u2018pull to refresh\u2019 function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline\u2014whether that\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email\u2014we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising \u2018likes\u2019 or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what\u2019s called \u2018ludic loops\u2019\u2014where a user is unsure whether they\u2019ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation\u2014is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.\u201dLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/There\u2019s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. As always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!","comment_o3":"What you\u2019re running into is a mix of revenge\u2011bedtime procrastination and simple decision\u2011fatigue. Sixteen hours of heavy thinking drains the part of your brain that says \u201cgo to bed,\u201d so the autopilot seeks an easy dopamine drip. Fight it with structure, not willpower. Pick a hard stop for work, then schedule a short decompress window you actually look forward to\u2014maybe 30\u201145 minutes of music, a walk, or light reading. When that window ends, the phone goes on a charger in another room, social apps are blocked by something like Cold Turkey, and the bedroom stays screen\u2011free. Make the shutdown ritual as automatic as brushing your teeth: shower, dim lights, stretch, fiction book, sleep. If you still need novelty during the day, insert micro\u2011breaks\u2014five minutes outside, quick chat, cup of tea\u2014so you\u2019re not starved for stimulation by night.

It\u2019s like your mind is trying to \u201crebel\u201d against all the structure and effort by chasing quick rewards. One thing that helped me was setting a hard cutoff time for screens\u2014like, phone goes in another room at 10pm, no exceptions. I also started prepping a \u201cwind-down\u201d routine in advance: a book I actually want to read, a podcast, or even just a shower and stretching. The key is to make the alternative as frictionless as possible, so you don\u2019t default to scrolling. If you slip up, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just reset the next day. Over time, your brain will start to crave the new routine instead. Consistency > perfection. You\u2019ve got this!"}},{"id":"t3_zs03uo","title":"[Need Advice] I still live with my mom at 26.

I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places.

The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it\u2019s been many many years (10+).I also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out.

Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma.

It\'s full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.You can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.She sounds toxic by telling you that you can\'t function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you\'re interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it\'s one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it\'s harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.Construction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.","comment_o3":"First, stop beating yourself up. Twenty\u2011six with a part\u2011time job and one class is not a life sentence; it\u2019s just your current snapshot. What you need most right now is a clear one\u2011year plan that gets you to a livable income and a realistic exit date, while keeping school moving in the background instead of letting it run the show.Income comes first because rent and groceries can\u2019t be deferred. Treat \u201cget to 35\u201340 hours a week\u201d as Priority A. Apply daily, follow up every 48\xa0hrs, and cast a wide net: retail, call centers, warehouse, temp agencies, hospitality, gig work\u2014anything that starts paying quickly. Use Cleveland\u2019s cost of living to your advantage; plenty of people your age share a house for $600\u2013700 a month. If your current employer can\u2019t give you hours, keep them only if the schedule flexibility helps school; otherwise swap them for a place that will.Once you hit full\u2011time hours, track every dollar for a month. You\u2019ll see where $100\u2013200 leaks out that could become an emergency fund. Aim to save one month of projected rent before you move; that\u2019s usually enough to keep surprises from sending you back home.Keep school but keep it cheap. Fill out FAFSA, talk to the community college\u2019s financial\u2011aid office, and see whether you qualify for the Pell Grant\u2014many students in your income range get tuition covered and some money back for books. Take only courses that march you toward a credential employers actually ask for (nursing prerequisites, IT cert classes, accounting, etc.). Evening or online sections let you hold a job without stretching yourself to the breaking point. One or two classes a term is fine; the degree doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t pay the bills.About the $500 storage \u201crent\u201d: that\u2019s a drain. Offer your mom something concrete\u2014spend two weekends photographing, listing, and selling the items, then split the money and shut the unit down.

If you want to build more independence, focus on small, consistent steps. Keep applying for more work, even if it\u2019s not your dream job\u2014having more hours or a second job can help you save up and eventually move out. Don\u2019t feel like you have to choose between school and work; lots of people do both, even if it\u2019s slow going. If you can, keep taking classes, even just one at a time, because a degree can open up more options down the line. But if money is super tight, it\u2019s okay to pause school for a bit and focus on work. The main thing is to keep moving forward, even if it\u2019s gradual. Set small goals each week\u2014like applying to X number of jobs, saving a certain amount, or learning a new skill. Over time, those add up.

Keep a quick tally in a notes app; the act of logging keeps you mindful and shows progress.Feed your brain better inputs.

I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\\\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","comments":{"best_comment":"PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHSHonestly though you\u2019re probably better off than you think if you see the problems.

Because money touches everything, I\u2019d start there: download a budget app, log the last three months of spending, and give every dollar a job.

Pick one or two things you want to improve\u2014maybe it\u2019s getting up at the same time every day, or setting aside 30 minutes to learn something new or work on a skill. Don\u2019t try to overhaul your whole life at once; consistency with small habits builds momentum and confidence. Write down what you want to do the night before, even if it\u2019s just \u201cwake up, shower, eat breakfast, read for 10 minutes.\u201d Crossing things off helps you see progress.For being more present and less in your head, try grounding techniques\u2014when you notice your mind wandering, focus on your senses: what you see, hear, or feel in the moment. Practicing this during conversations can help you become a better listener and more engaged with the world around you. Meditation or even just a few minutes of deep breathing can help train your attention, too.As for career direction, it\u2019s normal to feel lost, especially if you haven\u2019t had a chance to explore much yet. Try out different things, even if they\u2019re just hobbies or side gigs, and pay attention to what actually feels rewarding. You don\u2019t need to have a grand passion right away\u2014sometimes interest grows as you get better at something.Finally, don\u2019t beat yourself up for your past. You can\u2019t change it, but you *can* decide what you do next. Progress isn\u2019t linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep showing up for yourself, even in small ways, and over time you\u2019ll build the discipline and self-trust you\u2019re looking for. You\u2019ve already proven you can do hard things. Keep going."}},{"id":"t3_vpyfhz","title":"[Need Advice] Strong pull toward inaction when it comes to doing unpleasant activities.","body":"For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I\'d legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I\'ve done just that before.I realize it will ultimately come to \\"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\\" which is fine. But ideally I\'d like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","comments":{"best_comment":"Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.One of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.So here\u2019s the tips:1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you\u2019re more than capable, and just start again.Eventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.","percentile_10_comment":"I realised recently my messy room was a coping mechanism.

Tell yourself you only have to pick up one sock, or set a two\u2011minute timer and stop when it dings. Starting is the real hurdle; once you\u2019re moving, momentum usually takes over.  Prep the environment so \u201cdoing something\u201d is the default. Keep a trash bag open, leave the hamper in the middle of the floor, put the cleaning spray on the dresser\u2014anything that removes the micro\u2011friction of hunting for tools.  Give your brain a small reward while you work. Play a podcast or playlist you only listen to when tidying; it turns the session into something you partly look forward to.  The urge to do nothing never vanishes, but these tricks let you slip past it before it gets loud. Over time, the reps train your brain to see \u201cjust start\u201d as the automatic response instead of \u201cfreeze.\u201d","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, that pull toward inaction is super common, especially with tasks that feel boring or overwhelming. The trick isn\u2019t to eliminate the feeling (because it\u2019ll probably always pop up), but to make it easier to act despite it. One thing that helps is lowering the activation energy\u2014tell yourself you\u2019ll just clean for 2 minutes, or only pick up 5 things. Once you start, it\u2019s way easier to keep going. Also, try to make the task less unpleasant: put on music, set a timer, or reward yourself after. Over time, if you consistently act even when you don\u2019t feel like it, your brain starts to expect action instead of avoidance. It\u2019s not about never feeling resistance, but about building the habit of moving through it."}},{"id":"t3_124xh6v","title":"can a 37 yo man change his life?

Sleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won\'t magically fix everything, but I feel like it\'s a good first step.","comment_o3":"Quick wins first, then bigger moves.Start with sleep. Everything you wrote (energy, focus, weight, mood) gets worse when you\u2019re chronically underslept. Pick a single, non\u2011negotiable wake\u2011up time that gives you 7\u20138 hours if you were asleep by 2\xa0a.m. Even if you lie awake, get up at that set time; the mild pain trains your body to fall asleep earlier within a week or two. Kill screens and bright lights 60\xa0min before bed, caffeine after noon, and alcohol on study nights. If you snore, wake up gasping, or feel dead tired no matter what, ask a doctor about sleep apnea\u2014tons of \u201coverweight, always tired, ADHD that meds don\u2019t fix\u201d folks discover that\u2019s the real culprit.Next, create a 30\u2011minute morning \u201claunch sequence.\u201d Water, quick stretch, meds, review today\u2019s three priorities, 10\u2011minute apartment tidy. That little clean\u2011up stops the shame spiral and gives you a daily victory before work.For ADHD productivity, treat tasks like reps at the gym: short, counted, and timed. Use a 25/5 Pomodoro timer and aim for just two of those before lunch. Put your phone in another room, open only what you need, and start with something that takes five minutes to finish so your brain gets the dopamine hit. Momentum matters more than ambition right now.The law degree feels huge because it\u2019s undefined. Break the remaining six months into weekly deliverables (e.g., \u201cRead and outline Chapter 3 cases by Friday\u201d). Track them on a wall calendar you can physically mark. When you hit four weeks of green X\u2019s, reward yourself with something guilt\u2011free.About work: spend the first 15 minutes of every day writing the ONE thing that will get you fired if you ignore it. Do that first. Email your boss a short \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m on today\u201d note; light accountability works wonders, and they\u2019ll likely appreciate the visibility.Finances: open a spreadsheet tonight, list every debt, minimum payment, and interest rate\u2014ugly truth on one page. Tomorrow call each collector and set up an autopay plan. Once a payment schedule exists, the mental noise drops dramatically.The apartment: set a timer for 10 minutes after work and fill one trash bag. Stop when the timer rings. Repeat daily. Small doses bypass the overwhelm and, inside a month, the place will look completely different.Finally, don\u2019t try to \u201cfeel motivated.\u201d Act first, mood follows. Keep the commitments tiny, track them visibly, and stack small wins. Six months of steady, boring reps will rescue the degree, calm the job situation, clear the room, and shrink the debt. You\u2019ll still be you\u2014just a version that finishes things.

The good news is, you\u2019ve already done the hardest part by being honest about where you\u2019re at and wanting to change. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d suggest: forget about fixing everything at once. Pick one small, concrete thing you can do every day, even if it feels almost stupidly easy. For example, make your bed every morning, or spend 5 minutes tidying your room, or set a timer for 10 minutes of focused study. The point is to build momentum and prove to yourself that you can follow through, even in tiny ways. Once that\u2019s a habit, add another. For sleep, try to get up at the same time every day, even if you didn\u2019t sleep well\u2014consistency helps reset your body clock over time. For ADHD, meds aren\u2019t magic, but structure and external accountability can help a lot. Use reminders, alarms, or even ask a friend to check in on your progress. As for the law degree, break it down into micro-tasks\u2014like reading one page or writing one paragraph\u2014and don\u2019t worry about the big picture for now. If you\u2019re overwhelmed by your apartment, set a timer for 5 minutes and just start with one corner. Progress is progress, no matter how small. And if you can, talk to a professional about the exhaustion and sleep issues\u2014sometimes there\u2019s a medical piece that needs attention. You\u2019re not lazy or broken; you just need a system that works for you. Start small, be consistent, and don\u2019t beat yourself up for setbacks.

I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. Now, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I\u2019m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.I struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I\u2019d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don\u2019t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I\u2019d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn\u2019t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn\u2019t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do.

First, stop framing it as \u201cI need more discipline.\u201d The word is loaded in your head, so swap it for \u201cexperiments.\u201d Pick a ridiculously small, 5\u2011minute experiment you can do every day for two weeks. For a game dev that might be opening the project and fixing one line or writing one sentence of a design doc, then you\u2019re allowed to quit. For music it could be playing one scale on a single string. It feels stupidly small, but that\u2019s the point: you\u2019re proving to your brain that showing up doesn\u2019t equal pain.Second, separate outcome from identity. Instead of \u201cI never finish games so I\u2019m undisciplined,\u201d try \u201cI haven\u2019t found a system that lets me finish yet.\u201d Keep a physical notebook and each day write the date and what your 5\u2011minute experiment was. That growing list is concrete evidence that you can follow through, even if the tasks are tiny.Third, outsource structure until it\u2019s boring. Join a coworking Discord with daily check\u2011ins, hire a cheap accountability coach on Focusmate, or book a practice session with a teacher who expects a scale every lesson. External eyes lower the bar to starting because someone else is holding the frame.Fourth, treat therapy like a skills coach, not a deep dive into childhood unless you want that. A CBT or schema therapist can help you neutralize the \u201cdiscipline = threat\u201d association with evidence\u2011gathering and exposure exercises, the same way people unlearn phobias.Finally, give yourself a single finish line this year: one tiny, shippable game jam entry, one recorded cover that uses sheet music, whatever. Everything you do funnels toward that one finish, no side quests. When the urge to abandon pops up, remind yourself the whole goal is simply to finish something small once, not to make it perfect.It\u2019s unglamorous, but stacking laughably easy reps, using outside scaffolding, and aiming for one concrete finish is how I turned the lifelong wall into a speed bump.

For me, what helped was reframing what \u201cdiscipline\u201d even means. Instead of seeing it as this harsh, external force or a test of character, I started thinking of it as a set of small, neutral routines\u2014almost like brushing my teeth. I stopped trying to \u201cbe disciplined\u201d and just tried to do one tiny thing regularly, even if it felt pointless or too easy.

Set a timer, do the five minutes, then walk away guilt\u2011free. Most of the time you\u2019ll keep going because starting is the hard part, but even if you stop you\u2019ve still logged a win and proved to your brain that \u201cI do what I say.\u201dOnce you have a couple of five\u2011minute wins under your belt, schedule them for the same time each day so it turns into a default routine rather than a decision. Stack a cue you already do (morning coffee, lunch break, shutting the laptop at night) with the tiny task, then reward yourself immediately after\u2014something as small as a stretch, a song, or scrolling Reddit. That cue\u2011routine\u2011reward loop is what slowly rewires the mindset you\u2019re talking about.Next level: create tomorrow\u2019s to\u2011do list tonight and limit it to three items max. Anything else you finish is a bonus. When the list is short you spend less energy choosing and more energy doing. Use an actual timer (Pomodoro, 25/5, whatever) so you can\u2019t wander into YouTube or TikTok without noticing.Keep tracking the streak on paper or in an app; humans hate breaking streaks. Expect off days and treat them like speed bumps, not roadblocks\u2014just restart the streak the next morning without the self\u2011talk spiral. Discipline is basically momentum plus memory: the more often you see evidence that you can start, the easier it is to believe you\u2019ll keep going.Try this for two weeks, then widen the time block or add a second five\u2011minute habit.

Pick one grocery day and one bulk\u2011cooking block per week\u2014Saturday morning, Sunday evening, whatever\u2014and treat them like non\u2011negotiable appointments. On grocery day you buy for a fixed menu of 3\u20114 simple dishes that all share ingredients (for example: chana masala, stir\u2011fried veggies, and lemon rice use overlapping onions, tomatoes, peppers, and spices). On cooking day you batch\u2011cook double or triple portions, portion them into individual containers, and stack them in the fridge/freezer. Reheating when you get home takes five minutes, so dinner and tomorrow\u2019s lunch are sorted and the mental chatter about what to eat disappears.A cheap pressure cooker or Instant Pot pays for itself in time: throw soaked lentils + veggies + spices in the morning, set delay timer, and it\u2019s ready when you walk through the door. One\u2011pot dishes also mean almost no dishes\u2014lid, pot, spoon, done. For the rest of the kitchen mess, wash as you cook; you\u2019re standing there watching something simmer anyway.Housework is the same \u201csmall daily, bigger weekly\u201d system. Set a 10\u2011minute timer every night for a quick reset of the living room and dishes, and a 30\u2011minute timer on Sunday for sweeping, mopping, and bathroom wipe\u2011down. That\u2019s under two hours total per week, far less than the mental load of wondering when you\u2019ll clean.

It\u2019s not too much to ask to want a balance, but it does take some trial and error to find a routine that works. For cooking, try meal prepping on weekends or your least busy day\u2014make a big batch of something simple (like dal, sabzi, or khichdi) that you can eat for a couple of meals. You can also chop veggies and store them in the fridge for a few days, so daily cooking is faster. For cleaning, set a timer for 10-15 minutes each day after dinner and just do a quick tidy or dishes\u2014don\u2019t let it pile up. If you can afford a maid, maybe consider hiring one just for cleaning (not cooking), so you have less to manage. As for workouts, even a 10-minute routine in the morning is a good start; consistency matters more than duration. Waking up earlier is a gradual process\u2014try moving your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier every few days instead of a big jump. Most importantly, don\u2019t aim for perfection.

I hope you figure it out soon.","comment_o3":"A good way to jump\u2011start your old discipline is to use the guitar as your anchor habit. Tell yourself you only have to pick it up for five minutes every single day. Five minutes is so small it\u2019s almost impossible to skip, but once you\u2019re holding the instrument you\u2019ll usually play longer. Put the guitar on a stand in the middle of the room so it\u2019s the first thing you see after work or school, and make a rule that you touch it before you touch your phone or the TV remote. Keep a notebook or a simple spreadsheet where you jot down what you practiced each day and how long you played\u2014seeing a streak grow is motivating and makes skipping feel like breaking something valuable.Once that five\u2011minute guitar streak feels automatic, piggyback another micro\u2011habit right after it\u2014maybe ten push\u2011ups, a five\u2011minute walk around the block, or writing two sentences in a journal. The idea is to rebuild your discipline muscle with wins that are too small to fail, then gradually layer them until you\u2019re back to a routine you\u2019re proud of. If you ever fall off again, return to the five\u2011minute rule instead of beating yourself up. Consistency beats intensity, and tiny, locked\u2011in habits give you a foundation you can always rebuild on.","comment_gpt4dot1":"It\u2019s totally normal to go through ups and downs with discipline, especially when you\u2019re picking up something new like guitar. One thing that can help is setting really small, specific goals\u2014like practicing for just 5 or 10 minutes a day, even if you don\u2019t feel like it. Consistency matters more than intensity at first. You might also try tracking your practice sessions on a calendar or app, so you can see your progress over time. If you miss a day, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just get back to it the next day. Building discipline is a process, and every little bit counts. Keep at it, and you\u2019ll start to feel that momentum again."}},{"id":"t3_12k7iil","title":"[Need Advice]I cant even get myself to work 3 hours a day consistently.","body":"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work.

Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you\u2019re having a bad day and ask yourself \u201cwhat the f am I doing this?\u201d Your brain replies with the answer and continue.","comment_o3":"Three hours of \u201cpure work\u201d sounds small on paper, but it\u2019s a marathon if you\u2019re not used to sustained focus. Most people who claim they can crank out six deep\u2011work hours got there by building up in small blocks, not by flipping a switch. Instead of lowering the daily goal, try reframing it: commit to one focused 25\u2011minute sprint, then decide whether to do another. Stack those sprints until you hit three hours or until you call it for the day. If you only manage two sprints, you still practiced the skill and logged exactly how long you lasted, so you have real data to beat tomorrow.Make the sessions easier to start. The night before, write down the single most specific task you\u2019ll attack first\u2014e.g., \u201cWrite introduction paragraph,\u201d not \u201cWork on website.\u201d When you sit down, there\u2019s zero decision fatigue; you just press play. Pair that with a short pre\u2011work ritual (brew coffee, put phone in another room, open only the files you need). Linking the ritual to the first sprint cues your brain that \u201cthis is work time,\u201d the same way tying your shoes cues your brain it\u2019s gym time.The lack of immediate payoff is normal for knowledge work, so manufacture one. Keep a visible log of completed tasks or minutes\u2014crossing them off provides the quick dopamine hit you get from a pump in the gym. Schedule a small, guilt\u2011free reward after your last sprint: a walk, a game, whatever. The brain starts associating the end of a work session with something pleasant, making the next session easier to initiate.As for not caring about \u201cmaking bank,\u201d focus on the reason this business exists for you besides money. Is it learning a skill, earning freedom, solving a problem you find interesting? If you can\u2019t identify a why that resonates, you may be forcing yourself toward a goal you don\u2019t value, and no productivity hack will fix that. Either uncover a motivating purpose or pivot to work that does matter to you.Finally, expect fluctuation. Professional writers, developers, and academics have off days too; they just show up anyway and protect the habit. Treat each session as practice, not a performance. If you string together weeks of consistent 25\u2011minute blocks, you\u2019ll look back and realize you\u2019re already doing the three\u2011hour days you thought were impossible.","comment_gpt4dot1":"Honestly, it\u2019s super common to hit a wall after a couple of good days, especially when you\u2019re trying to build a new habit. Three hours of focused work is actually a lot if you\u2019re not used to it, so there\u2019s nothing wrong with starting smaller and ramping up. You might find it easier to break your work into shorter chunks\u2014like 25-30 minutes with breaks in between\u2014rather than trying to power through hours at a time. Also, if you\u2019re not feeling much reward or meaning from the work itself, it can help to set up some kind of immediate payoff for finishing your sessions, even if it\u2019s just a small treat or a bit of downtime. Not everyone is wired to grind for hours on end, and that\u2019s fine. The key is consistency, not perfection. If you can reliably do even an hour a day, that\u2019s a solid foundation to build on. Over time, you\u2019ll probably find your capacity grows as the habit gets stronger."}},{"id":"t3_s2mn65","title":"[need advice] how do you ppl get the energy to cook on weekdays?!","body":"Before you say, cook on weekends.

Two meal preps a week is totally reasonable\u2014maybe Sunday and Wednesday? Also, don\u2019t underestimate the power of a good playlist or podcast to make the process less of a chore. The first week or two is the hardest, but once you get a rhythm, it gets easier.

Start by lowering the bar: decide what your \u201cminimum viable workout\u201d is\u2014something so easy it feels almost silly (10 push\u2011ups, a 15\u2011minute jog, a few kettlebell swings). On days you feel great you can do the full session; on days you don\u2019t, you still do the minimum and keep the habit chain intact. That stops a two\u2011day break from turning into two weeks.  Schedule your training like a meeting and build the logistics the night before: clothes laid out, water bottle filled, playlist or podcast queued. When the alarm goes off you\u2019re on autopilot instead of negotiating with yourself.  Use an actual program with planned rest days and a deload week every 4\u20136 weeks. Programming takes the guesswork out and prevents the \u201call\u2011in until I crash\u201d cycle. Tracking your lifts or run times in an app/notebook is another quiet motivator\u2014seeing numbers creep upward makes you want to protect the streak.  If you miss a day, just do the next scheduled workout. No extra punishment, no \u201cstarting over,\u201d no guilt. The goal is to act like someone who works out, not someone chasing a perfect record. Consistency isn\u2019t never missing; it\u2019s resuming quickly after you do.  Treat the habit as identity (\u201cI\u2019m a morning lifter\u201d) and logistics (\u201calarm at 5:30, gym at 6\u201d) rather than willpower.

What\u2019s helped me (and a lot of others) is making the habit as easy and automatic as possible.

That way, you keep the streak alive and reinforce the habit. Consistency beats intensity in the long run. Lastly, try to tie your workouts to something you already do every morning (like right after brushing your teeth) so it becomes part of your routine, not a decision you have to make each day.

This is brought under control by insulin released by special cells in the pancreas. It is hypothesized that hyperglycemia reduces the level of orexin, which plays a major role in maintaining alertness. You can call it the alertness hormone.How to manage this? Cut down on carbs, sub it with protein, reduce servings ideally. I skip lunch entirely and have breakfast and an early dinner.

My breakfast during the week is a Quest bar, and my lunch varies but is usually something like a chicken soup, chili, meat and cheese (skip the crackers though), something like that. I\'d also recommend spice for lunch. Eating something extremely spicy will help keep you alert. Peppers are really good for you, too.The one exception is in the early summer when it\'s in season I like to have fresh fruit, especially berries, and whipped cream, because that is just one of my favorite things.For dinner after you are mostly done being productive for the day is the time to eat your carbs.","comment_o3":"The post\u2011meal crash is usually a mix of biology and habit. Around 1\u20133\xa0p.m. your circadian rhythm naturally dips, and a big carb\u2011heavy lunch spikes insulin, shuttles tryptophan to the brain, and you get sleepy. If you\u2019re already carrying some sleep debt, that dip feels like a brick wall. You can\u2019t delete the biology, but you can blunt it enough to stay productive.First, audit the meal itself. Swap out huge portions of rice, bread, or pasta for more protein, veggies, and healthy fats, and keep the total calories reasonable. Chase it with a full glass of water\u2014dehydration amplifies fatigue. If you\u2019re a coffee drinker, have the cup right after eating; caffeine takes ~20\xa0minutes to kick in, lining up nicely with the dip.Second, move immediately. Stand up the moment you finish the last bite and take a 5\u201310\xa0minute brisk walk, ideally outside for sunlight. The combo of light and movement tells your brain it\u2019s still \u201cgo\u201d time and evens out blood glucose.Third, give yourself a controlled outlet. A 15\u201320\xa0minute \u201cpermission nap\u201d (set an alarm, lie on the couch, not the bed) can recharge without letting you drift into a full sleep cycle. If you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll over\u2011snooze, hold a pen or your phone loosely\u2014when it drops, you wake up.Fourth, safeguard the environment. Keep study materials in a different room, or leave the house entirely for a library/coffee shop sprint session after lunch. When the bed isn\u2019t within arm\u2019s reach, the friction of going back to it often overrides the impulse.Finally, check the foundation: 7\u20139 hours of consistent nighttime sleep, same wake\u2011up time daily, and no marathon bedtime phone scrolling. When nightly rest is solid, the afternoon slump becomes a speed bump instead of a ditch.Tweak one variable at a time for a week so you know what\u2019s actually helping, then stack the wins.

If you\u2019re eating heavy or greasy foods, that can make it worse.A few things that might help: Try eating a lighter lunch with more protein and veggies, and less simple carbs. Drink water instead of sugary drinks. After eating, get up and take a short walk, even just around your room or outside for five minutes\u2014it really helps wake you up. If you can, avoid lying down right after eating, since that signals your body it\u2019s time to rest.

Track progress weekly, not daily: \u201cDid I hit four French sessions and four guitar sessions this week?\u201d Checking boxes daily can crush motivation when life happens, but a weekly score lets you stay flexible.  Finally, cap your idea intake. Keep a running \u201clater\u201d list for courses, books, and business ideas so they\u2019re not rattling in your head demanding attention.

The reality is, you *can* do a lot, but not all at once. The trick is to pick 1-2 things to focus on for a set period (like a month or two), and let yourself rotate interests over time. For example, you could dedicate 30 minutes a night to music, and 30 minutes to French, and let the rest be free time or for winding down. Or, you could do music on Mon/Wed/Fri, and French or reading on Tue/Thu. The key is to make a simple, repeatable schedule that you can stick to even when you\u2019re tired. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of small, consistent effort. Even 20 minutes a day adds up over months. Also, try to set a \u201cminimum viable\u201d version of each habit\u2014like playing one song, reading 5 pages, or doing 10 minutes of Duolingo\u2014so you can keep momentum on low-energy days. If you\u2019re feeling burnt out, it\u2019s okay to just rest sometimes, but try to avoid defaulting to TV every night. Maybe set a rule: do one productive thing before you turn on the TV.As for starting a company, that\u2019s a huge goal and will require a lot of time and energy. It might help to treat it as a long-term project and just start by dedicating a small, regular slot each week to brainstorming or research. Once you get momentum, you can ramp up.TL;DR: Pick a couple priorities, make a simple schedule, keep your daily goals small, and rotate interests over time.

The main tip to wake up early is to sleep early and always the same time, including weekends, in a few days you\'ll naturally wake up the same hour everyday, the problem is that usually when our system is understanding our new routine we screw up during the weekend.   Talking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   In a few days you\'ll love your new routine and you\'ll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don\'t have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there\'s always a little windows to stick something new you want to try.

Give yourself a 30\u2011minute wind\u2011down without screens so you\u2019re actually asleep when you think you are. When you wake up, get bright light and a glass of water immediately.

No matter how little you slept, get out of bed at that time, expose your eyes to bright light immediately (sunlight or a 10\xa0k\u2011lux lamp), and move your body for a few minutes. The first day will be rough, the second a little less so, and by the third or fourth your body will crash earlier in the evening because it\u2019s short on sleep. Keep the wake\u2011up time identical for at least two weeks\u2014even weekends\u2014so your circadian clock can reset.At night, give yourself a strict \u201cscreens off\u201d cutoff an hour before the earliest time you\u2019d be okay falling asleep. Use that hour for something boring and dim\u2011lit: paperback reading, light stretching, journaling. If you\u2019re still wide awake after twenty minutes in bed, get up, do a low\u2011stim activity until drowsy, then try again; lying there frustrated trains your brain to associate bed with wakefulness.ADHD makes sleep hygiene harder because impulse control is already taxed, so make the path of least resistance the one you want.

Text a friend a selfie on your morning walk, book an early study group, or join a Discord where people post daily check\u2011ins. Consistent external pressure keeps ADHD brains on track until the habit feels normal again.Give it one solid month of identical wake\u2011ups and light exposure, and the 7\xa0a.m.\u201310\xa0a.m. bedtime will start to feel as weird as it should.
