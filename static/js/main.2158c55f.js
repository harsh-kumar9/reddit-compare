I understand one needs to use discipline instead, to do it even if they don\'t feel like it.\\n\\nThe problem is, I don\'t even get fleeting motivation. I understand motivation is not helpful for actually completing tasks, but I get the sense that it\'s somewhat necessary for original goal setting. I can\'t set meaningful goals at all.\\n\\nThere\'s nothing I really want. Sure, every once in a while I think something might be nice, but then I think a little harder about what actually would happen, and realize that I actually am not interested in it at all. For example, I might randomly think \\"hey wouldn\'t it be cool to play the piano\\" but I have no real desire or emotion attached to it, and once I picture myself having learned to play the piano, I wouldn\'t want to play anyway, I wouldn\'t care that I could play, I just wouldn\'t really get anything out of it at all. That\'s not even counting all the effort in hypothetically learning how to play. I can\'t think of any goal that would really have any long term positive benefit that would outweigh the upfront pain and discipline.\\n\\nThis makes goal setting seem like an exercise in futility. Every single idea I come up with seems as random and pointless as if I randomly strung together a sentence. Getting better at math or reading a book or whatever, when I truly don\'t care about it and don\'t see any way I could apply the skills to get any benefit, looks exactly the same to me as \\"My goal will be... \'Balance\'... \'Shoe\'... \'Under\'... \'Knee\'\\". My response is always immediate bewilderment and a resounding *why?!*\\n\\nI swear, I don\'t need a huge why. I regularly push through pain at work because an employee gets the job done until they decide to formally quit. I respond to emails and texts promptly no matter how anxious or busy or whatever I am because it shows respect. I do fine with health-related goals, because I can see the benefits of having more strength and energy, and ultimately staying healthy and independent for longer.\\n\\nThe problem is with self-improvement or overall living a more disciplined life, things I know I \\"should\\" do but can\'t really find any reason why. I\'m just not a very disciplined person. I know discipline > motivation. But I just don\'t understand what the point of, for example, developing a hobby is, if all it really is doing something you hate just so you can get better at something you hate just for what, masochism brownie points?\\n\\nThis lack of discipline is starting to become even more problematic. I\'m at an age where I need to apply to colleges and decide what I\'m going to do, and I just can\'t bring myself to study and apply anymore. I\'ve never had problems in school in the past, but I just can\'t see any benefits of going to college vs going to trade school. I have no interests, as long as I make enough to eat it\'s all the same to me. So it\'s not that I don\'t want to work on applications, it\'s that I don\'t want the applications to be done. I don\'t want to get good grades. It\'s suddenly very hard to muster up discipline to work towards things I don\'t actually want to happen.\\n\\nI\'ve tried just pushing through and following random goals for the discipline. I always heard that motivation will eventually follow action. This never happens. I start off trying to ignore my misgivings and just do it, over time (like for months, I am giving it a bit of a chance) I come to hate it more and more, and eventually the stress of trying to continue force myself starts carrying over into other areas of my life, until finally I admit that I hate it and I\'m not going to get any foreseeable benefits and it\'s only getting worse. I give in and show that I don\'t have discipline after all. This hits especially hard with hobbies, because they require so much discipline, and there\'s no real reason for them other than personal fulfillment and enjoyment, which I never feel no matter how long I force myself or how good I get.\\n\\nThen I hear on here that it never ends. You always have to use discipline. It\'s always a struggle. I just don\'t understand why I should try to be disciplined, if I\'ll always only struggle and never get any benefit.\\n\\nPeople always say that the pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret, but what do you do when you genuinely just don\'t feel regret? Admittedly I\'m young, but I\'ve never regretted missing out on opportunities or not doing enough. I\'ve only ever regretted working so hard at things that didn\'t matter, I wish I could\'ve rested and relaxed more, and I wish I wouldn\'t have ruined the few interests I had trying to turn them into hobbies. I\'ve always been more laid-back and don\'t really dwell on potential life paths anyway. Nothing is really important to me except my health which I already work to maintain, nothing really interests me enough to outweigh the pain of discipline.\\n\\nWith this attitude, it\'s very difficult to see why I should even bother. I know that ultimately I\'m just whining, but I was just wondering if anyone knew what could help with this, or at least if anyone else is in the same boat? Is there anything I\'m just not thinking of? Is it really just an unrealistic expectation to have a reason or a bit of motivation while setting goals? If they won\'t be meaningful anyway, what goals do I set, how do I even know I\'m setting the right ones? Or am I just making a lot of excuses and I just need a swift kick in the pants lol\\n\\nBasically, how to find the motivation to use discipline in the first place?","comments":{"best_comment":"Do you have any parents to provide structure and impetus to your life? Few young people ever \\"reasoned\\" themselves into better habits all by themselves.","percentile_10_comment":"I\'m the excact same","gpt_comment":"It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, and it\'s understandable to feel stuck when nothing seems to spark genuine interest. One approach you might consider is focusing on small, low-pressure experiments rather than setting big goals. Instead of committing to a hobby or a path, try exploring different activities with a mindset of curiosity rather than obligation. For example, you could try a new activity for just 10 minutes a day or once a week, without any expectation of sticking with it long-term. This way, you might stumble upon something that naturally piques your interest without the pressure of turning it into a goal.\\n\\nAlso, consider reframing discipline as a tool for self-discovery rather than self-improvement. It\'s not just about achieving something but about learning more about what you enjoy or value. Sometimes, the act of doing can lead to unexpected insights about what matters to you. Lastly, it\'s okay to not have everything figured out right now. Life is a series of experiments, and it\'s perfectly fine to take your time finding what resonates with you.","claude_comment":"Your post really resonates because it highlights a common catch-22: it\'s hard to build discipline without having meaningful goals, but it\'s hard to find meaningful goals without some initial spark of interest or motivation.\\n\\nHere\'s what I suggest: instead of trying to manufacture interest in random hobbies or forcing yourself to set arbitrary goals, start by examining what already drives your existing behaviors. You mentioned you consistently handle work responsibilities, maintain your health, and respond promptly to communications. These aren\'t random - they align with your values of reliability, independence, and respect for others.\\n\\nTry building on these existing foundations. Rather than asking \\"what hobby should I force myself to do?\\", ask \\"what would help me become even more reliable/independent/respectful?\\" This shifts the focus from trying to generate artificial interests to expanding on values you already demonstrate.\\n\\nFor the college situation - instead of trying to manufacture passion for a specific field, approach it through the lens of expanding your capacity for independence and reliability. What path would give you the most options and flexibility? What skills would make you a more capable person overall?\\n\\nThe goal isn\'t to suddenly become passionate about everything. It\'s about recognizing that discipline can serve your existing values, even if you don\'t feel motivated about specific activities. Start small - pick one area where being more disciplined would directly support something you already care about, even if the individual tasks themselves don\'t excite you.\\n\\nRemember that not everyone needs to be passionate about their work or have intense hobbies. There\'s nothing wrong with being laid-back. The key is building discipline in service of the few things you do genuinely value, rather than trying to force yourself to care about things that truly don\'t matter to you.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re struggling to find meaning or purpose in setting goals, which is making it hard for you to develop discipline. One thing that might help is to focus on the process rather than the end result. Instead of thinking about what you want to achieve, think about what kind of person you want to be or how you want to show up in your daily life. For example, do you want to be someone who is reliable and responsible? Do you want to be able to tackle challenges head-on? \\n\\nYou mentioned that you\'re able to push through pain at work and respond to emails promptly because it shows respect, which suggests that you value being a respectful and responsible person. Maybe you can use those values as a starting point for developing discipline in other areas of your life. It\'s not about finding a specific goal that motivates you, but about cultivating habits and behaviors that align with your values.\\n\\nIt might also be helpful to start small and focus on building discipline in tiny ways, like creating a daily routine or setting aside a few minutes each day for self-reflection. These small wins can add up over time and help you build confidence in your ability to follow through on commitments. \\n\\nAs for finding motivation, it\'s possible that you\'re looking at it the wrong way. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try to focus on building curiosity. What are you interested in learning more about? What problems do you want to solve? Even if you don\'t feel passionate about something, you might be curious about it, and that can be enough to get you started.\\n\\nLastly, it\'s worth considering that discipline is not just about achieving specific goals, but also about developing a sense of self-awareness and self-regulation. By cultivating discipline, you\'re not just working towards external outcomes, but also building your internal capacity to navigate life\'s challenges. That in itself can be a powerful motivator, even if you don\'t have a specific goal in mind.","gemini_comment":"Okay, I get where you\'re coming from. It sounds like you\'re in a bit of a motivational rut, and forcing yourself into things just makes it worse. The whole \\"discipline for discipline\'s sake\\" thing can feel pretty pointless when you don\'t see the point.\\n\\nMaybe the problem isn\'t a lack of discipline, but a lack of direction. You\'re trying to apply discipline to goals that don\'t resonate, and that\'s a recipe for burnout. Instead of focusing on grand self-improvement projects, try experimenting with small, low-stakes things. Think of it as gathering data, not committing to a lifestyle.\\n\\nFor example, instead of \\"learn piano,\\" try \\"spend 15 minutes exploring a free online piano lesson.\\" No pressure to become a concert pianist, just a tiny experiment to see if anything sparks your interest. If it doesn\'t, no big deal, move on to something else. The key is to remove the pressure of long-term commitment and focus on the immediate experience.\\n\\nAs for college vs. trade school, maybe talk to people in both fields. Shadow someone for a day. See what their actual day-to-day looks like. Don\'t just think about the end result, but the process itself. Which path seems more tolerable, or even mildly interesting?\\n\\nAlso, it\'s okay not to have a burning passion right now. A lot of people don\'t. Focus on building a life that\'s sustainable and allows you to explore different options. Maybe that means finding a job that pays the bills and leaves you with enough free time to try new things without feeling overwhelmed.\\n\\nFinally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore your values and identify what truly matters to you, without the pressure of having to \\"fix\\" yourself. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Don\'t beat yourself up for not being \\"disciplined\\" enough. Focus on finding something that makes you want to be.\\n"}},{"id":"t3_13d7kef","title":"[Need Advice] I\'m 13 with a minor self-harm habit. (Explanation below.)

First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for help\u2014recognizing the issue is a big step. Here are a few things you might try to help break this habit:\\n\\n1. **Awareness**: Try to become more aware of when you\'re scratching. You could keep a small journal or use a notes app to jot down when you notice yourself doing it. This might help you identify patterns or triggers.\\n\\n2. **Substitute Habit**: Find something else to do with your hands. Stress balls, fidget spinners, or even a small piece of fabric to fiddle with can keep your hands busy and away from your face.\\n\\n3. **Mindfulness**: Practice being present in the moment. Techniques like deep breathing or meditation can help you become more aware of your actions and reduce the urge to scratch.\\n\\n4. **Physical Barriers**: Wearing gloves or band-aids on your fingers can serve as a physical reminder not to scratch. It might feel a bit odd at first, but it can be effective.\\n\\n5. **Talk to Someone**: If you haven\'t already, consider talking to a trusted adult or counselor about this. They can offer support and might have additional strategies to help you.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s okay to ask for help, and you\'re not alone in this. Keep at it, and don\'t be too hard on yourself.

The good news is there are proven ways to manage this!\\n\\nFirst, try keeping your hands busy. Get a fidget toy, stress ball, or silly putty to occupy your hands while reading/gaming. Some people find success with wearing thin cotton gloves when alone, making it physically harder to scratch.\\n\\nFor immediate help, keep your nails trimmed very short and file them smooth. Put bandaids on spots you frequently scratch to create a physical barrier. You can also try putting Vaseline on vulnerable areas - it makes scratching less satisfying and helps healing.\\n\\nThe key is replacing the scratching with a different habit. When you catch yourself about to scratch, immediately do your replacement activity instead. It could be squeezing a stress ball, doing a quick hand exercise, or even just clasping your hands together. Be patient - it takes time for new habits to stick.\\n\\nConsider talking to your doctor or school counselor about this. They can connect you with resources and strategies specifically for managing excoriation. You\'re not alone in dealing with this, and it\'s great that you\'re taking steps to address it at a young age.\\n\\nRemember - change happens gradually. Focus on progress, not perfection.

It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the impact this habit is having on your health and wanting to make a change. \\n\\nOne thing that might help is to become more aware of when you\'re scratching. Since you mentioned it\'s an unconscious habit, trying to catch yourself in the act can be really helpful. You could try setting reminders throughout the day to take a few deep breaths and check in with your body - are your hands on your face? Are your fingers twitching to scratch? \\n\\nAnother strategy is to find alternative things to do with your hands when you\'re reading, gaming, or eating. This could be as simple as holding a stress ball, playing with a fidget toy, or even just keeping your hands busy with a small task like doodling or tapping on a surface. \\n\\nIt might also be helpful to talk to a trusted adult - not necessarily your family members who have been scolding you, but maybe a school counselor or another relative - about what\'s going on and how you\'re feeling. They may be able to offer some additional support or guidance that can help you work through this habit. \\n\\nLastly, consider keeping a journal or log of when you scratch and what might have triggered it. Was it stress? Boredom? Something else? Identifying patterns can help you develop strategies to avoid or cope with those triggers in healthier ways. \\n\\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and patience, so be gentle with yourself and don\'t get discouraged if you slip up. You\'re taking the first steps towards making a positive change, and that\'s something to be proud of.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I\'m really sorry to hear you\'re going through this. It takes a lot of courage to talk about self-harm, even minor forms. The fact that you recognize it\'s a problem and want to stop is a huge first step.\\n\\nSince you\'re doing it unconsciously, you need to bring it to your conscious awareness. Here are a few things that might help:\\n\\n*   **Awareness is key:** Try keeping a journal specifically to track when you scratch. Note the time, what you were doing, and how you were feeling right before. This can help you identify triggers.\\n*   **Replacement behaviors:** When you catch yourself scratching, immediately replace it with something else. Fidget toys, stress balls, or even just making a fist can give your hands something to do.\\n*   **Barriers:** Since you\'re scratching your face, maybe try wearing soft gloves while you\'re reading, gaming, or writing. It\'ll make it harder to scratch without noticing.\\n*   **Positive reinforcement:** Reward yourself for days you don\'t scratch. It doesn\'t have to be anything big, just something you enjoy.\\n*   **Professional help:** This is a tough one to tackle alone. Talking to a therapist or counselor could give you tools and strategies tailored to your specific situation. Many schools have counselors available, and there are also online options.\\n\\nIt\'s going to take time and effort, and you\'ll probably slip up sometimes. Don\'t get discouraged! Just keep trying, and remember that you\'re not alone in this. Be patient and kind to yourself.

Alternatively, you could try listening to music or nature sounds that you find uplifting or stimulating. Some people also find that doing something creative, like drawing or writing, can help them break out of a brain fog cycle.

Here are a few more ideas that might help you get closer to that 100% success rate:\\n\\n1. **Sleep Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is optimized for sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, blackout curtains, and a cool room temperature. Sometimes small tweaks can make a big difference.\\n\\n2. **Consistent Wind-Down Routine**: You mentioned reading before bed, which is great. Try to keep your wind-down routine consistent every night to signal to your body that it\'s time to sleep.\\n\\n3. **Light Exposure**: In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. This can help reset your internal clock and make waking up easier. If natural light isn\'t an option, consider a light therapy lamp.\\n\\n4. **Alarm Variety**: Since Alarmy worked well for you, maybe try varying the types of puzzles or challenges it offers. This can keep your brain engaged and prevent you from getting too used to the same routine.\\n\\n5. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Incorporating a short mindfulness or meditation practice before bed can help improve sleep quality, making it easier to wake up.\\n\\nRemember, perfection isn\'t always necessary, and even a 70% success rate is a solid foundation. Keep experimenting with small changes, and you\'ll likely find what works best for you. Good luck!","claude_comment":"You\'re already doing a lot of great things with your evening routine! Getting to 70% consistency is actually impressive. For that final 30%, here are some additional strategies that could help:\\n\\nFirst, track the mornings when you don\'t wake up successfully. Look for patterns - is it happening more on certain days of the week? After particular activities the day before? This data can help you identify and address specific triggers.\\n\\nSince Alarmy worked well for you, consider combining it with a smart bulb or sunrise alarm clock. These gradually brighten your room before your alarm time, helping your body wake up more naturally. The light + puzzle combination can be really effective.\\n\\nAlso, while your sleep schedule is good, you might experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier. Sometimes we need a bit more sleep than we think, and that extra buffer can make morning wake-ups easier.\\n\\nOne last suggestion: create a small reward system for your first few minutes awake. Maybe it\'s a favorite podcast you only listen to during your morning routine, or a breakfast you really look forward to. Having something enjoyable right after waking can help train your brain to get up more willingly.\\n\\nKeep building on what\'s working - you\'re definitely on the right track with your current habits. Small tweaks to an already solid foundation can make a big difference.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'ve already established a solid morning routine and have tried several strategies to improve your wake-up consistency. To help boost that 70% success rate to 100%, I\'d suggest exploring a few additional tactics. Have you considered exposing yourself to natural light as soon as your alarm goes off? This can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make it easier to wake up. You could also try making your morning routine more enjoyable, such as listening to music or doing some light stretching - this might give you something to look forward to and make it easier to get out of bed. Additionally, you might want to experiment with a \\"stop doing\\" list, where you identify any habits or activities that might be sabotaging your sleep or making it harder to wake up, such as scrolling through your phone before bed or consuming heavy meals too close to bedtime. It\'s also worth considering whether there are any underlying issues, such as sleep quality or stress, that might be affecting your ability to wake up consistently. The Alarmy app seems like a great tool, so you might want to keep using that and see if you can combine it with some of these other strategies to get to 100%.","gemini_comment":"Hey, that\'s a really solid routine you\'ve already built! Getting to 70% is a great accomplishment. Here are a few ideas to nudge you closer to 100%:\\n\\nFirst, since you\'re already using Alarmy and it worked well, maybe experiment with different puzzle types or difficulty levels within the app. Keep it challenging enough that you\'re actually awake when you solve it.\\n\\nSecond, consider *why* you\'re failing the other 30% of the time. Are you hitting snooze without realizing it? Are you genuinely still exhausted? If it\'s exhaustion, maybe slightly adjust your bedtime earlier, even by just 15 minutes. If it\'s the snooze button, try putting your phone and alarm clock even FURTHER away, like in a different room entirely. Make it a real chore to turn them off.\\n\\nThird, think about adding a reward system. If you wake up on time for a full week, treat yourself to something you enjoy (a special breakfast, a new book, etc.). Positive reinforcement can be surprisingly effective.\\n\\nFinally, and this might sound counterintuitive, but don\'t beat yourself up too much about the occasional slip-up. It happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Consistency is key, but perfection is the enemy of good.

I often mess up my routine, but it doesn\'t put you back into square one. How stupid will that be. i.e. I want to develop the habit to save $1000 every month. I managed to do it for a year. I have $12000 saved up. I didn\'t save the next month, it doesn\'t put my savings back to $0. I know it\'s a crude example but it applies to any habit you want to form and messing up once doesn\'t put you back at square one.

Your pleasure seeking self has some control, your lazy self has some control, you all have some control together.\\n\\nIt\'s important to create feedback loops. There is a 100% chance that you won\'t get everything right on your first try. Therefore create mechanisms to constantly correct your plans. There are PDCA cycles, there is scrum, there is journaling. Choose whatever you like, but make sure it lets you create working feedback loops.\\n\\nAlso, don\'t use brute force. Find good enough reason for everything you do so you don\'t have to use force.\\n\\n3) If you set ambitious goals you won\'t make 100% of what you planned on most days. It\'s ok. Get used to not being perfect.\\n\\n>I guess I dont really have a \\"why\\" for all this nor an end goal, all I know is that I just want to be better and improve what I can\\n\\nYou need to rectify this, because if you don\'t know where you are going you won\'t get there. There are many \\"being betters\\". One may want to get rid of fat to live longer but in other circumstances one may want to put on fat to live longer (famines happened many times in history). So think about and write down your specific objectives first.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! It\'s awesome that you\'re ready to make some changes and take control of your life. Here are some thoughts on your questions:\\n\\n1. Starting with one habit at a time is usually more sustainable. It helps you focus and build confidence as you see progress. Trying to change everything at once can be overwhelming and lead to burnout. Pick one habit that you think will have the most positive impact and start there.\\n\\n2. To improve discipline, consistency is key. Set small, achievable goals and gradually increase the challenge as you get more comfortable. Tracking your progress can also be motivating. Apps or a simple journal can help you see how far you\'ve come and keep you accountable.\\n\\n3. On days you mess up, remember that it\'s totally normal. The important thing is to not let one off day derail your progress. Reflect on what went wrong, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Progress isn\'t about being perfect; it\'s about being persistent.\\n\\nSince you mentioned not having a \\"why,\\" maybe spend some time thinking about what truly matters to you and what you want to achieve. Having a clear purpose can be a powerful motivator. Good luck, and remember that improvement is a journey, not a destination!","claude_comment":"First off, it\'s great that you recognize the opportunity in front of you and want to make positive changes. Let me address your questions directly:\\n\\nFor your first question about planning vs jumping in - start small but start now. Pick 1-2 habits you want to build and focus on those for 30 days. Planning is good, but too much planning can become procrastination. The key is to make your initial changes small enough that they feel almost too easy. Want to exercise? Start with 5 minutes daily. Want to read more? Begin with 2 pages per day.\\n\\nOn building discipline and sticking to habits: The most effective approach is to link new habits to existing ones (habit stacking) and make them ridiculously small at first. If you want to meditate, start with taking 3 deep breaths right after brushing your teeth. The smaller the habit, the easier it is for your brain to accept it as part of your routine.\\n\\nFor handling setbacks: Think of your routine like GPS navigation - when you miss a turn, it doesn\'t tell you to give up and go home. It just recalculates from where you are. If you miss a day, simply resume the next day. No guilt, no making up for lost time, just pick up where you left off.\\n\\nNot having a specific \\"why\\" isn\'t necessarily bad, but you might find it helpful to spend 10 minutes writing down what \\"better\\" looks like to you. Even if it\'s vague like \\"more energy\\" or \\"feeling more in control,\\" having something concrete can help guide your choices.\\n\\nRemember: consistency trumps intensity. It\'s better to do something small every day than to do something big sporadically. Start small, stay consistent, and let the momentum build naturally.","llama_comment":"It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the need for change and wanting to improve yourself - that\'s a huge step already. To answer your questions, I\'d say it\'s often a good idea to start by planning out your goals and habits, but not to the point where you get stuck in analysis paralysis. Try to find a balance between planning and taking action. You could start by identifying one or two key habits you want to change or implement, and then create a rough plan for how you\'ll make that happen. \\n\\nAs for improving discipline and sticking to new habits, it\'s all about creating an environment that supports your goals and making small, incremental changes that add up over time. You might consider tracking your progress, finding accountability with a friend or community, and rewarding yourself for small wins along the way.\\n\\nOn days when you mess up, don\'t be too hard on yourself - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track as soon as possible. Remember that building new habits is a process, and it\'s normal to have ups and downs. Instead of getting discouraged, try to focus on what you can learn from the experience and how you can improve moving forward.\\n\\nNot having a clear \\"why\\" or end goal isn\'t necessarily a bad thing - sometimes just knowing that you want to be better and improve is enough to get started. As you make progress and build new habits, you may find that your goals and motivations become clearer over time. One general tip I\'d offer is to focus on building positive habits rather than trying to cut out negative ones. By adding more good habits to your routine, you\'ll naturally start to crowd out some of the bad ones. Keep in mind that it\'s okay to take things one step at a time, and don\'t be afraid to experiment and try new things until you find what works for you.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it\'s awesome that you\'re recognizing your potential and wanting to make a change! It\'s a great first step.\\n\\nRegarding your questions:\\n\\n1.  **Easing in vs. Brute Force:** Most people find more success with easing in. \\"Brute force\\" can lead to burnout. Start with ONE habit. Nail it down. Then add another. Think small, achievable wins. For example, instead of \\"workout every day,\\" start with \\"walk for 20 minutes three times a week.\\"\\n\\n2.  **Improving Discipline and Sticking to Habits:** A few things here. First, make your habits ridiculously easy to start. James Clear calls this the \\"Two-Minute Rule\\" in *Atomic Habits*. If you want to read more, I highly recommend that book. Second, track your progress. Even just a simple checkmark on a calendar can be super motivating. Third, build in accountability. Tell a friend about your goals, or find an online community.\\n\\n3.  **Messing Up:** Everyone messes up! Don\'t beat yourself up about it. The key is to get back on track as quickly as possible. If you miss a day, don\'t let it turn into two. Just acknowledge it, learn from it (what tripped you up?), and get back to it the next day. Don\'t let a slip-up derail your entire effort.\\n\\nSince you mentioned not having a \\"why\\" or end goal, maybe spend some time reflecting on your values. What\'s truly important to you? What kind of person do you want to be? Connecting your habits to your values can provide a powerful source of motivation. Even just journaling for 10 minutes a day can help you figure this out.

I also prioritised having a good social life, sleep, having a clean environment etc. But I was still experiencing burnout and I decided to do the bare minimum for a week and my personality had a radical change - I was much calmer, happier and rational. In other words, my burnout decreased significantly. That means it was these healthy things that were causing my burnout.

It\u2019s okay to not do those things sometimes. It\u2019s all about balance.","percentile_10_comment":"You pay attention to how you feel and what is happening for you in any moment, and you honour that. In my experience rest is the most important form of self care and also the most underrated in a society that is so focused on output. So, build in more time for rest, adjust your expectations of yourself when it comes to how much you want to get done and find ways to get what your body needs that aren\u2019t creating more stress. \\n\\nSelf care should never be about ticking boxes, it\u2019s about learning to listen to yourself and using that information to determine what you need the most at that time.

Self-care should feel like a break, not another item on your to-do list. Maybe try simplifying your routine and focusing on what truly makes you feel good rather than what you think you should be doing. It\u2019s okay to have days where you just do the basics and give yourself permission to relax. Also, consider mixing in activities that are purely for fun or creativity, without any pressure to achieve something. Balance is key, and sometimes less is more. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!","claude_comment":"It sounds like you might be approaching self-care as another set of tasks to rigidly complete rather than activities that should make you feel better. Self-care shouldn\'t feel like a burden - it\'s about finding the right balance that works for you.\\n\\nTry scaling back to focus on what actually makes you feel good and energized. Not every healthy habit needs to happen every single day. Maybe you feel great after socializing twice a week rather than forcing yourself to go out every night. Or perhaps meal prepping on Sundays works better than cooking fresh daily.\\n\\nStart by picking 2-3 core habits that give you the most benefit and make those non-negotiable. Then treat the others as \\"nice to haves\\" that you can flex around your energy levels. The goal is sustainable progress, not perfection.\\n\\nRemember that rest and downtime are also forms of self-care. If taking a week to do the bare minimum helped you feel better, that\'s valuable information. Consider building regular \\"low power mode\\" days into your routine where you deliberately dial things back. This isn\'t failing at self-care - it\'s actually listening to what your body and mind need.\\n\\nThe best self-care routine is one you can maintain long-term without burning out.

One potential approach could be to re-evaluate your self-care routine and see if there are any areas where you can scale back or make things more flexible. For example, instead of feeling like you need to cook a healthy meal every night, maybe you could aim for 3-4 nights a week and give yourself permission to have something simpler the other nights. Similarly, you might consider prioritizing the self-care activities that bring you the most joy and relaxation, and letting go of any that feel more like obligations. By finding a better balance and being kinder to yourself, you may be able to reduce your risk of burnout while still taking care of your physical and emotional needs.","gemini_comment":"Hey, that\'s a really interesting situation!

Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and celebrate the progress you make along the way.\\n\\nKeep pushing forward, and don\'t hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off - you\'re not \\"behind in life.\\" There\'s no universal timeline, especially given how expensive housing has become. Many people in their 20s live with family while building towards independence.\\n\\nThat said, it sounds like your current situation isn\'t healthy. Your mom telling you you\'re \\"incapable of functioning\\" is concerning and likely affecting your confidence. The fact that you\'re working, studying, doing housework, and actively trying to improve shows you ARE capable.\\n\\nHere\'s what I suggest:\\n\\nMake a clear financial plan. Track every dollar you spend and earn. The $500 you\'re paying for storage could be going towards your own place or more classes. Talk to your mom about selling that stuff or finding a cheaper storage solution.\\n\\nDon\'t quit school, but do look for full-time work. Many companies offer tuition assistance - this could help you take more classes. A degree generally leads to better opportunities, but you can work on both simultaneously.\\n\\nStart building your independence in steps. Open your own phone plan. Take over your grocery expenses. Each small step builds confidence and practical skills. Look for roommate situations - this can make rent much more manageable while you\'re getting established.\\n\\nMost importantly, recognize that you\'re already taking positive steps. Working part-time, studying, and actively seeking solutions are all signs of someone who\'s capable and motivated. Keep building on that momentum, but be strategic about where you put your energy and resources.\\n\\nFocus on what you can control and change today, rather than feeling ashamed about the past. You\'ve got this.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, but the fact that you\'re recognizing your situation and wanting to make changes is a huge step. First, let\'s acknowledge that it\'s not uncommon for people to live with their parents into their 20s or even 30s, especially with the rising costs of living. \\n\\nIt seems like you have a few different goals competing for priority - becoming independent, finishing your education, and finding better work. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe focus on making progress in one area at a time. For example, you could try to increase your income by taking on more hours or finding a better-paying job, which would give you more financial stability and autonomy. \\n\\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your goals and aspirations. It\'s possible that she\'s not aware of how her comments are affecting you, and talking it through could help clear the air and give you a better understanding of each other\'s perspectives.\\n\\nAs for whether to prioritize independence or education, it\'s not necessarily an either-or situation. You could try to find ways to balance both, like taking online classes or finding a job that offers tuition reimbursement. And it\'s definitely not stupid to work \\"shitty jobs\\" without a degree - many people have to start at the bottom and work their way up, and having some kind of income can give you the freedom to pursue other opportunities.\\n\\nRemember that becoming independent is a process, and it\'s okay to take it one step at a time. You\'re already taking classes and paying your mom rent, which shows that you\'re capable of taking care of yourself to some extent. Try to focus on making progress rather than beating yourself up over what you perceive as shortcomings. You got this, and it\'s never too late to make changes and start moving in a direction that feels more fulfilling to you.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re actively trying to change things is a huge first step. Don\'t beat yourself up too much; everyone\'s journey is different.\\n\\nFirst, let\'s tackle the immediate issue: independence. It seems like you\'re stuck in a cycle where your mom\'s expectations are holding you back. You need a clear, actionable plan to break free.\\n\\nI wouldn\'t necessarily quit school *entirely*, but maybe scale back to focus on work for a bit. One class is manageable, but if it\'s a huge stressor, consider pausing. The goal is to get some financial breathing room.\\n\\nPrioritize finding better/more work. \\"Shitty\\" jobs aren\'t stupid if they\'re a stepping stone. Look for opportunities with potential for growth or skills development, even if they\'re not glamorous. Think about what skills you have or can easily learn (customer service, data entry, etc.) and target those areas. Temp agencies can be a good way to get your foot in the door.\\n\\nCreate a detailed budget. Track every penny coming in and going out. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and where you can cut back. It will also help you set realistic savings goals.\\n\\nStart small with savings. Even $25 a week adds up. The key is consistency. Automate it if you can, so it happens without you having to think about it.\\n\\nTalk to your mom. Have an honest conversation about your goals and your need for independence. Set clear boundaries and expectations. This might be difficult, but it\'s crucial. Explain that you appreciate her help, but you need to learn to stand on your own two feet. Maybe even propose a timeline for moving out, even if it\'s a year or two down the road.\\n\\nAs for the storage unit situation, that\'s a tricky one. Maybe suggest helping her list some of the items online to generate some extra income. It could be a win-win.\\n\\nUltimately, it\'s about taking small, consistent steps towards your goals. Focus on building your financial stability first, then revisit the degree question later.

While it\'s possible that you might be experiencing hypersomnia, it\'s also important to consider other factors that could be contributing to your sleepiness, such as your sleep schedule, diet, and overall lifestyle habits. Before jumping to conclusions, you might want to try a few things to see if they make a difference. For starters, establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help improve the quality of your sleep. Additionally, getting some morning sunlight exposure can help regulate your circadian rhythms, which can help you feel more alert during the day. In terms of staying awake during the day, taking short breaks to stretch or move around can be really helpful - even just a few minutes of fresh air or a short walk can make a big difference. You could also try incorporating some caffeine into your daily routine, but be careful not to overdo it. Lastly, it might be worth speaking with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleepiness.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don\'t sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn\'t get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day\'s productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance.

After such intense work, your brain craves a break, and social media offers quick, easy dopamine hits. The problem is, it can become a cycle that disrupts your sleep and productivity. \\n\\nTo break this habit, try setting a specific time limit for social media use in the evening, maybe 30 minutes, and stick to it. Use apps that can help you enforce these limits. Also, consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn\'t involve screens\u2014like reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music. This can help signal to your brain that it\'s time to wind down. \\n\\nRemember, it\'s about finding balance.

After intense analytical work, your brain is still in high-gear and craving easy stimulation - social media provides that quick hit of novelty and entertainment.\\n\\nThe key is creating a proper wind-down routine that helps transition your mind from work mode to rest mode. When you finish work, try setting a 30-minute timer for your social media use. Once it goes off, switch to calming activities like reading a physical book, light stretching, or journaling. The physical separation from your phone is crucial here.\\n\\nYou might also want to experiment with a \\"shutdown ritual\\" - a consistent set of actions that signal to your brain that work is done for the day. This could be as simple as writing down tomorrow\'s tasks, clearing your desk, and changing into comfortable clothes.\\n\\nFor immediate practical steps: Move your phone charger away from your bed, use app blockers after certain hours, and switch your phone to grayscale mode in the evening. Having a glass of water and doing some deep breathing exercises can help too.\\n\\nRemember that those 16-hour workdays are intense - your brain needs genuine downtime to process and recover. Building in proper breaks and rest periods will actually make you more productive in the long run than pushing through and falling into the social media trap.\\n\\nThe fact that you\'re aware of this pattern and seeking to change it is already a huge step.

This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, practicing some light stretches, or reading a book.

It sounds like you\'re caught in a cycle that\'s tough to break, but the good news is that you can definitely turn things around with some small changes. First, try setting a specific time limit for your YouTube sessions, like 15-20 minutes, and use an app or timer to help you stick to it. Once the time\'s up, switch to one of the activities you love, even if it\'s just for 10 minutes. This way, you\'re gradually building the habit of transitioning from distractions to productive activities. Also, consider starting your day with a quick win\u2014something small and easy from your list that you can accomplish right away. This can give you a sense of achievement and momentum to tackle more. Remember, it\'s all about progress, not perfection. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Hey there - breaking out of a procrastination loop is tough, but totally doable. The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum from there. Instead of making lists of everything you want to learn, pick ONE tiny thing to focus on first.\\n\\nFor example, if you want to read more, commit to reading just one page before touching your phone in the morning. That\'s it. One page. Make it so easy you can\'t say no. Put your phone in another room while you do it.\\n\\nFor the phone/YouTube habit, try installing a website blocker and setting specific times when you can watch videos. Cold turkey is rough - scheduling dedicated \\"YouTube time\\" makes it more manageable. You could do 25 minutes of focused activity (reading, drawing, whatever you picked), then allow yourself 5 minutes of videos as a reward.\\n\\nThe urges and distractions will still come up, but instead of beating yourself up, just notice them and gently redirect back to your chosen activity. Every time you do this, you\'re building that discipline muscle.\\n\\nRemember that change happens gradually. Focus on consistency over intensity. If you stick to even 5-10 minutes of deliberate practice each day, you\'ll be amazed at how things shift over a few weeks. You\'ve already taken the first step by recognizing the pattern - now it\'s just about taking small actions to change it.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re really struggling with getting started on the things that genuinely interest you, and instead, you\'re getting caught up in a cycle of distraction.

Make it super concrete and manageable. Then, try to eliminate the distractions before they even become an issue. For example, you could delete YouTube from your phone or use a website blocker to limit your access to it during certain hours of the day. It might also be helpful to create a morning routine that gets you started on a positive note, like making a cup of coffee and reading for 10 minutes before even checking your phone. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to be perfect - so don\'t be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Just acknowledge it and try to do better the next day. You\'ve got a lot of interesting hobbies and passions, and it\'s worth finding ways to make time for them.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re stuck in a tough cycle, but the fact that you\'re aware of it and want to change is a huge first step. It\'s super common to get caught in those loops.\\n\\nOne thing that might help is to make the things you *want* to do easier to access than the distractions. So, instead of waking up and immediately grabbing your phone, try putting it across the room or even in another room overnight. Maybe put a book you\'re excited about right next to your bed. Small changes to your environment can make a big difference.\\n\\nAlso, don\'t try to overhaul everything at once. Pick *one* thing from your list that you\'re genuinely excited about and commit to just 5-10 minutes on it. Seriously, that\'s it.

Once you\'ve done that for a few days, you can slowly increase the time.\\n\\nRegarding the other thing, don\'t beat yourself up too much. It happens.

Ask yourself why you think that way and if it\'s based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\\n\\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\\n\\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge.

Breaking free from prejudiced thinking takes conscious effort and practice, but it\'s absolutely achievable through discipline and intentional habit-building.\\n\\nStart by catching yourself in the moment when these thoughts arise. Instead of letting them flow automatically, pause and actively challenge them. Ask yourself: \\"What evidence actually supports this view? Am I making unfair generalizations? What other factors might explain this situation?\\"\\n\\nA practical approach is to deliberately expose yourself to perspectives and stories that humanize people from different backgrounds. Find documentaries, books, or podcasts created by people from the groups you have biases against. Learning about individual experiences and achievements helps break down stereotypes.\\n\\nAnother effective technique is to practice \\"replacement thinking.\\" When you notice a prejudiced thought, immediately replace it with a more rational, fact-based observation.

Be patient with yourself while remaining committed to improvement.

This can help you identify patterns and measure your improvement over time.","llama_comment":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change harmful thought patterns, so kudos to you for recognizing the issue and seeking help. Recognizing and challenging our own biases is a difficult but crucial step in personal growth. One strategy that might help is to practice critical thinking when consuming media - ask yourself if the narrative being presented is balanced, if it\'s perpetuating stereotypes, and what other factors might be at play. Additionally, try to seek out diverse perspectives and engage with content that challenges your existing views. When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and reflect on why you\'re thinking that way - is it based on personal experience, or is it a product of societal conditioning? By becoming more aware of your thoughts and actively working to reframe them, you can start to break down those biases. It\'s also important to remember that having racist thoughts doesn\'t define your worth as a person, but rather it\'s an opportunity to learn and grow. You might consider exploring resources on unconscious bias, privilege, and social justice to help broaden your understanding. Remember, changing thought patterns takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep working towards a more empathetic and inclusive mindset.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it\'s really commendable that you\'re recognizing these thoughts and wanting to change them.

Make a conscious effort to diversify your social media feed and the news sources you consume. Expose yourself to different viewpoints and experiences.\\n\\nAnother thing you could try is challenging your own thoughts when they arise. When you catch yourself thinking something racist, ask yourself: \\"Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought?

Set daily goals that are achievable and specific. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.\\n\\n2. **Create a Schedule**: Structure can be your best friend right now.

This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.\\n\\n5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can be a great stress reliever.

Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\\n\\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\\n\\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I\'m home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn\'t do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\\n\\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week\'s worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\\n\\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven\'t or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don\'t do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\\n\\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don\'t work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\\n\\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I\'m typically just a lazy slug.","comments":{"best_comment":"What you need are two things:\\n\\n1) A mentor. \\n\\nAnyone who you can trust that can support you and help you to develop the skills you need to be able to be more productive and achieve your goals. This person can help you by giving you advice, helping you train, support you when you fail or provide the kind of influence you need to reach the level of success your mind is pushing you towards. \\n\\n2) Habits:\\n\\nYou need to develop habits that will propel you into the future and towards your inner self\'s level of expected success.

They are easy to start and over time, become engrained into your daily ritual to the point of subconsciousness. \\n\\nBreak the mindset that your path to success is A to B. It\'s really A to Z. Start small. Start with easy changes that do not require a lot of effort or change who you are overnight. Build from there.

It sounds like you\'re dealing with a lot, but it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice. Procrastination is a tough habit to break, but it\'s definitely possible with some small, consistent changes. \\n\\nFirst, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about an entire project, focus on just the first step. This can make starting feel less overwhelming. Also, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes to work on something. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you\'re in the flow, you\'ll find it easier to keep going.\\n\\nSince the internet is a big distraction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting sites during your study time. You can also try the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make study sessions feel less daunting.\\n\\nFor your home tasks, try to incorporate them into your daily routine. For example, do a quick 5-minute tidy-up every day instead of waiting for that rare burst of energy. \\n\\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It\'s okay to struggle, and change takes time. Celebrate small victories and don\'t beat yourself up over setbacks. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Thanks for sharing your story so openly. Your situation is really common - procrastination tends to become a cycle that feeds into itself, especially when we develop the habit early on. The good news is that you\'re aware of it and wanting to change at 18, which gives you plenty of time to develop better habits.\\n\\nFrom what you\'ve described, it seems like the home environment hasn\'t been conducive to focused work, and you\'ve gotten used to separating \\"home time\\" from \\"work time.\\" A practical solution would be to find a different physical space to do your work - like a library, study room, or quiet caf\xe9. This creates a mental separation and can help break the association between home and procrastination.\\n\\nFor the immediate term with finals coming up, try the \\"Pomodoro Technique\\" - work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Start with just ONE 25-minute session. Don\'t think about the whole project, just commit to those 25 minutes. Most people find that getting started is the hardest part, but once you begin, it\'s easier to continue.\\n\\nFor the longer term, start building what I call \\"small wins.\\" Instead of trying to change everything at once, pick ONE small task - like doing laundry on a specific day of the week. Make it ridiculously easy to achieve. Once that becomes routine (which might take a few weeks), add another small habit.\\n\\nThe internet is clearly a major distraction for you. Try using website blockers during your study sessions. Forest is a good app that gamifies staying off your phone. You could also try the \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" approach - physically put your phone in another room while studying.\\n\\nRemember that discipline isn\'t about being perfect - it\'s about being consistent. You don\'t need to become a productivity machine overnight. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.","llama_comment":"It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with procrastination, and I appreciate your honesty. Given your history and the factors that contribute to your procrastination, it\'s clear that this is a deeply ingrained habit that will take time and effort to change. \\n\\nFirstly, acknowledging that you enjoy learning in classes but struggle with homework and research at home is a crucial insight. It might be helpful to explore ways to make your home study environment more conducive to productivity. This could be as simple as dedicating a specific area for studying, free from distractions like your bed or gaming console.\\n\\nSince you\'ve mentioned that traditional methods like journaling or creating to-do lists haven\'t worked for you due to commitment issues, let\'s consider an alternative approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, start with small, manageable goals. For example, commit to working on a task for just 10-15 minutes without any distractions. After this short period, take a brief break before returning to the task. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help build momentum and make tasks less overwhelming.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to address your internet usage, as you\'ve identified it as a significant contributor to your procrastination. Consider implementing website blockers or apps that help you stay focused on your tasks during certain periods of the day.\\n\\nGiven that finals are approaching, let\'s focus on creating a plan for the next week. Break down your study material into smaller chunks, and allocate specific times for reviewing each subject. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible, but don\'t be too hard on yourself if you slip up \u2013 simply acknowledge the setback and get back on track.\\n\\nLastly, remember that developing discipline and overcoming procrastination is a journey. It\'s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\'s essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. You\'ve already taken a significant step by sharing your struggles and seeking help, so keep moving forward, even if it\'s just a small step each day.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get where you\'re coming from.

You\'re aware of the problem, and that\'s the first step. It sounds like you\'re putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can actually make procrastination worse.\\n\\nSince you mentioned internet distractions, maybe try some strategies to minimize those. Could you use website blockers or apps that limit your time on certain sites while you\'re trying to work? Even just putting your phone in another room can make a difference.\\n\\nYou also mentioned that you don\'t like doing extra work at home. Have you considered changing your environment?

I always worked so hard. After my GCSE\u2019s, it felt like my ability to stay motivated started declining. I\u2019ve now graduated from university and it\u2019s a struggle to do anything. \\n\\nAs for background info, I was prescribed antidepressants 4 years ago. Over that time, I\u2019ve tried different types and doses. I think the most recent change was about 2 years ago. My depression has definitely contributed to times of feeling lethargic and demotivated, but lately it feels different.\\n\\nAfter graduating last July, I had a few months break before getting a retail job to earn some money. I left at the end of January this year to take the time to apply for a masters course. Any time I felt drained, I assumed it was from being at work a lot or recovering from my retail routine, however, it\u2019s now been months and I\u2019m still struggling. \\n\\nI have a lot of hobbies. I get interested in something for a while and then move onto something new. Some stick, a lot don\u2019t. Now, I can\u2019t seem to do any of them. I have dreams and goals, but anything more than getting out of bed feels too difficult. I have a very imaginative mind, but I no longer feel like I have the motivation to put it to use. Occasionally, I\u2019ll have a day where I manage to clean my whole room or go for a run, but soon I go back to how I felt before. Even small attempts to break the cycle don\u2019t seem to work for me. If they do, I eventually go back to struggling with things like putting a sock in a drawer. It makes me angry, frustrated and I feel worthless.\\n\\nOrdinarily, I find it hard to accept that sometimes my mental health prevents me from doing things. I automatically think I am making excuses and that I\u2019m using my depression as one. I even feel like I\u2019m making my depression up at times and convince myself I am attention seeking. Now, it\u2019s even worse and I can\u2019t stop worrying that I\u2019m using depression as an excuse for plain laziness. I\u2019ve wondered if something like ADHD or bi-polar is responsible, but again, I feel I am looking for a reason to explain ordinary laziness. \\n\\nI often see things like \u2018don\u2019t demand too much of yourself\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s ok if all you did today was survive\u2019 or \u2018you are allowed to take a break\u2019, but I tell myself that these don\u2019t apply to me. I shouldn\u2019t go easy on myself because I have no reason to be like this. I am just lazy and useless and it is my own fault.\\n\\nI just want to go back to feeling motivated and being productive.

It sounds like you\'re dealing with a lot, and it\'s important to acknowledge that mental health can have a huge impact on motivation and energy levels. You\'re not alone in feeling this way, and it\'s not just laziness.\\n\\nOne thing that might help is to start small and build from there. Instead of focusing on big goals, try setting tiny, manageable tasks each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or spending 5 minutes on a hobby. Celebrate these small wins, because they do matter.\\n\\nAlso, consider creating a routine that includes time for rest and self-care. Sometimes, having a structure can help provide a sense of normalcy and accomplishment. Remember, it\'s okay to have off days, and it\'s okay to rest. You\'re not making excuses; you\'re taking care of yourself.\\n\\nIf you haven\'t already, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional about how you\'re feeling. They can offer guidance tailored to your situation and help you explore if there are other factors at play, like ADHD or something else.\\n\\nLastly, be kind to yourself. You\'re doing your best, and that\'s enough. It\'s okay to take things one step at a time. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Hey there. What you\'re experiencing sounds really challenging, and it\'s completely understandable to feel frustrated. The \\"gifted kid burnout\\" is a very real phenomenon, and the transition after university can be particularly tough.\\n\\nFirst off, please know that seeking explanations for how you\'re feeling isn\'t making excuses - it\'s trying to understand yourself better so you can move forward. Whether it\'s depression, ADHD, or something else, these are real medical conditions that deserve proper attention. Consider talking to your doctor about how your current medication is working and potentially getting evaluated for ADHD, as many of your experiences align with its symptoms.\\n\\nNow, for some practical steps forward: Instead of trying to recapture your old spark all at once, start rebuilding it gradually. Pick one tiny habit - something ridiculously small like putting away one item before bed. The goal isn\'t to clean your whole room; it\'s to build trust with yourself that you can do something consistently.\\n\\nWhen you have those occasional productive days, rather than seeing the return to struggle as failure, try to identify what made those days different. Was it better sleep? More structure? Understanding these patterns can help you recreate more good days.\\n\\nAlso, those messages about being gentle with yourself? They absolutely apply to you. Think of it this way: if you were training for a marathon after being inactive, you wouldn\'t start by running 26 miles. You\'d start with walking, then jogging, gradually building up your stamina. The same applies to mental and emotional energy.\\n\\nConsider setting up a very simple routine - even just 10 minutes of something you used to enjoy, without any pressure to be \\"productive.\\" The goal isn\'t to feel motivated (motivation follows action, not the other way around), but to simply show up and do the thing, however imperfectly.\\n\\nRemember: you\'re not lazy or worthless. You\'re someone who\'s dealing with real challenges and actively seeking ways to improve. That alone shows strength and determination, even if it doesn\'t feel that way right now.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re dealing with a really tough mix of feelings, from guilt and frustration to worries about your motivation and mental health. First, let\'s acknowledge that it\'s amazing you\'ve recognized the patterns and are seeking help - that in itself is a huge step. \\n\\nGiven your history with depression and the fact that you\'ve been on different medications, it might be helpful to have an open conversation with your doctor or a therapist about how you\'re feeling now. It\'s possible that your treatment plan could be adjusted or that there are other underlying factors at play, like ADHD or bipolar disorder, as you\'ve mentioned. But even if that\'s not the case, talking through your feelings and experiences with a professional can provide valuable insights and strategies to cope.\\n\\nIn terms of building motivation and productivity, it might be helpful to start incredibly small. Instead of trying to tackle big projects or hobbies, begin with tiny, manageable tasks like making your bed or putting away one item. Celebrate each of these tiny wins, no matter how insignificant they seem. Sometimes, getting momentum going, even at a very slow pace, can help build confidence and motivation.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to challenge the narrative that you\'re lazy or useless. Those are harsh judgments that don\'t account for the complexities of mental health, personal growth, or the simple fact that everyone has ups and downs. Remind yourself that it\'s okay to not be okay, and that taking care of your mental health is not something to be ashamed of. \\n\\nLastly, consider keeping a journal or log of your days - not to track productivity, but to observe patterns, feelings, and small accomplishments. This can help you identify times when you feel more motivated or capable, and what might contribute to those feelings.\\n\\nRemember, rebuilding motivation and finding your spark again is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself.

It\'s not laziness; it sounds more like burnout and potentially some lingering effects from the depression.\\n\\nInstead of trying to overhaul your entire life, maybe focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps. Like, instead of cleaning your whole room, could you just put one thing away? Or instead of a run, a 5-minute walk around the block? The idea is to make the barrier to entry so low that it\'s almost impossible to say no. Those small wins can build momentum.\\n\\nAlso, it might be worth revisiting your doctor about your medication. You mentioned it was changed two years ago, and sometimes things need tweaking. It\'s a process, and it\'s okay to ask for help with it.\\n\\nRegarding the hobbies, don\'t pressure yourself to stick with something if it\'s not bringing you joy. Maybe try revisiting an old hobby you used to love, or explore something completely new without any expectations. The point is to experiment and see what sparks your interest, even if it\'s just for a little while.\\n\\nFinally, challenge those negative thoughts. You\'re not lazy or useless. You\'re a person who\'s struggling, and that\'s okay. Try writing down those negative thoughts and then writing down a more realistic and compassionate response to each one.

Here are a few tips that might help:\\n\\n1. **Sleep Quality**: Make sure you\'re getting enough sleep at night. If you\'re waking up at 5 am, aim for a bedtime that gives you 7-9 hours of sleep. Quality matters too, so try to keep your sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet.\\n\\n2. **Morning Routine**: Start your day with some light exercise or stretching. This can help wake up your body and mind, setting a positive tone for the day.\\n\\n3. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Drink water first thing in the morning and keep hydrated throughout the day. Eating a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs can also help maintain your energy levels.\\n\\n4. **Breaks and Movement**: Incorporate short breaks into your study sessions. A quick walk or some light stretching can boost your energy and focus.\\n\\n5. **Power Nap**: If possible, a short nap (10-20 minutes) around midday can recharge you without affecting your nighttime sleep.\\n\\n6. **Caffeine Timing**: If you use caffeine, try to have it in the morning and avoid it in the afternoon to prevent disrupting your sleep cycle.\\n\\nAdjusting to a new routine takes time, so be patient with yourself.

The mid-day crash you\'re experiencing is pretty common when adjusting to early mornings. Here\'s what can help:\\n\\nFirst, make sure you\'re actually getting enough total sleep. Even with a 5am wake-up, you should aim for 7-8 hours, which means lights out by 9-10pm. No screens for at least 30 mins before bed.\\n\\nFor the mid-day slump specifically: Try taking a 15-20 minute power nap around 10:30am (before the crash hits). This can be incredibly refreshing and won\'t interfere with nighttime sleep. If naps aren\'t possible, get up and do 5 minutes of physical activity - jumping jacks, quick walk, or stretching when you start feeling drowsy.\\n\\nYour eating patterns matter too. Have a protein-rich breakfast and avoid heavy carb-loaded lunches that\'ll make you sleepy. Keep healthy snacks like nuts or fruit handy for steady energy. Stay hydrated throughout the day.\\n\\nConsider breaking your study sessions into 45-minute chunks with 5-10 minute breaks. During peak drowsiness (11-12), switch to more active learning methods like explaining concepts out loud or working through practice problems instead of passive reading.\\n\\nGive these adjustments a try for a week and see what works best for you.

To combat mid-day drowsiness, have you considered taking a short walk or doing some light exercise around 10-11 am to get your blood flowing and oxygen levels up? Sometimes, a change of scenery or a bit of physical activity can help increase alertness. Additionally, make sure you\'re staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the morning, and try to avoid heavy meals or sugary snacks that can cause an energy crash later on. You might also experiment with taking a 10-15 minute power nap if you\'re feeling extremely fatigued, but set an alarm so you don\'t oversleep. As for studying productivity, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between - this can help you stay focused and retain information better.

Creating a routine can help shift your mindset from work mode to home mode. Since you\'ve mentioned that traditional advice hasn\'t worked, maybe try incorporating something you enjoy into your routine, like listening to a favorite podcast or music while you clean.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself. It\'s okay to have days where things don\'t go as planned. Progress isn\'t always linear, and every small step counts. If therapy hasn\'t been helpful in the past, maybe exploring different types of therapy or support groups could offer new perspectives. You\'re not alone in this, and reaching out here is already a positive step.","claude_comment":"It sounds like you\'re experiencing burnout from giving all your energy to work, leaving nothing in the tank for your personal life. This is actually pretty common - our brains have limited willpower each day, and you\'re spending most of it at your job.\\n\\nThe key is to start really small. Don\'t try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE tiny habit to build first - something that takes 2 minutes or less. Maybe it\'s making your bed each morning, or washing one dish right after you use it. The goal isn\'t to transform your apartment overnight, it\'s to prove to yourself that you can stick to something small.\\n\\nFor the motivation piece - your brain might be understimulated at home compared to work. Try setting a timer for just 10 minutes when you get home and tackle one small area. Put on some music or a podcast while you do it. Sometimes just getting started is the hardest part, but movement creates momentum.\\n\\nGiven your PDD diagnosis, please don\'t beat yourself up about this. It\'s great that you\'re actively trying different solutions. While therapy is expensive, many areas have sliding scale options or support groups that could help. Your current medication doesn\'t seem optimal either - it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor.\\n\\nRemember: tiny steps, one habit at a time, and be patient with yourself. You\'ve already shown you can be disciplined at work - now it\'s just about redirecting some of that energy homeward in small, manageable chunks.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re struggling with a bit of a disconnect between your work life and personal life, where the discipline and motivation you have at work isn\'t translating to your home life.

These tiny wins can add up over time and help build momentum. It\'s also worth exploring ways to make cleaning and organization more manageable, like breaking tasks into smaller chunks or finding a cleaning routine that works for you.\\n\\nIt\'s great that you\'ve been open to trying new things, even if they haven\'t worked out - the hike, the PS5, etc. Sometimes it takes a bit of experimentation to find what actually resonates with us. Have you considered exploring other hobbies or activities that might bring you joy and help you feel more engaged at home? Maybe there\'s something creative, like drawing or writing, or something practical, like cooking or gardening, that could help you find some purpose and motivation.\\n\\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it\'s really tough to deal with medication and therapy not seeming to work, especially when it feels like you\'ve tried everything. If you feel comfortable, it might be worth talking to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan or exploring other options - sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right combination of things that work for us. Keep in mind that building discipline and habits is a process, and it\'s okay to take it one step at a time.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, and it\'s awesome that you\'re reaching out. It\'s really common to feel drained after work, especially when you\'re giving it your all. Don\'t beat yourself up too much about the apartment situation \u2013 it happens.\\n\\nSince you\'ve tried some bigger changes like the hike and they didn\'t stick, maybe try breaking things down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of aiming for a spotless apartment, could you commit to just washing one dish after each meal? Or making your bed every other day? The goal is to build momentum, not perfection.\\n\\nAlso, it might be worth revisiting your doctor or psychiatrist about your medication. Since you\'ve been on so many different ones without much success, there might be other options or approaches to explore. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right fit.\\n\\nAs for the free time, instead of trying to force yourself into hobbies, maybe just experiment with different things for 15-20 minutes each day. See if anything sparks your interest, even if it\'s just a little bit. It could be anything from drawing to learning a new language to trying a new recipe. The key is to keep it low-pressure and fun.

I\'m not waiting for their validation, praise, approval anymore. \\n\\nMy school experience was the same: I trained my sopranos while my coach worked on the altos, she called me rude. I was the Head of stage managent for a uni event. There were boxes of sponsored items backstage, and no one informed us. I called the sponsorship team but no one picked up, so I moved the sponsored items out cuz we needed the space. As a result, some of the items got stolen. I got called stupid, and I gave them hell. \\n\\nIt makes me standoff-ish, but I\'m slowly realising I don\'t have a choice. (advice needed, DO I have a choice?).

That\'s the difference between us.","gpt_comment":"It sounds like you\'re dealing with a lot of external doubt, but it\'s great that you\'re recognizing the need to move forward without waiting for validation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\\n\\n1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your overseas dream. Break it down into smaller, actionable steps. This will help you focus on what you can control and make the dream feel more attainable.\\n\\n2. **Build a Support Network**: Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your dreams. This could be friends, mentors, or online communities. Having a positive support system can make a huge difference.\\n\\n3. **Practice Self-Validation**: Start acknowledging your own achievements and progress. Celebrate small wins and remind yourself of your capabilities.

You can say something like, \\"I understand it\'s challenging, but I\'m committed to giving it my best shot.\\"\\n\\n5. **Learn from Criticism**: While some comments can be discouraging, try to extract any constructive feedback that might help you improve. If there\'s nothing useful, let it go.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s your journey, and you\'re allowed to dream big. Keep exploring and refining your path, and don\'t let doubt hold you back. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Your friend is absolutely right - people who question \\"what makes you think you can do X\\" often speak from their own limitations and fears. The fact that you\'ve already succeeded as a vice president, managed events, and run an online business while studying shows you\'re capable of achieving what you set your mind to.\\n\\nHere\'s what\'s worked for many people dealing with unsupportive comments: First, recognize that seeking validation is natural, but make it a conscious practice to act independently of others\' approval. When someone questions your abilities, respond with \\"I\'ll figure it out\\" or \\"We\'ll see\\" and keep moving forward. These responses acknowledge the challenge while maintaining your autonomy.\\n\\nFor your overseas work dreams specifically - start taking concrete steps. Research visa requirements, connect with people who\'ve done it, maybe start learning the language. Each small step builds momentum and proves to yourself (not others) that you\'re serious about this path.\\n\\nThe standoffishness you\'re feeling isn\'t necessarily bad - it\'s your independence asserting itself. But instead of becoming defensive, channel that energy into quiet determination. Let your actions speak louder than any response you could give to doubters.\\n\\nRemember: Every person who\'s achieved something meaningful faced doubters along the way. The key difference is they kept going anyway. You\'ve already shown you can succeed despite skepticism - your track record proves it. Keep building those habits, keep exploring your interests, and keep moving forward. The best response to \\"what makes you think you can do X\\" is simply doing X.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re at a crossroads where you\'re trying to break free from seeking validation from others, especially your mom, and forge your own path. That takes a lot of courage, so kudos to you for recognizing the pattern and wanting to make a change.\\n\\nWhen dealing with comments like \\"what makes you think you can do X,\\" it\'s essential to remember that they often stem from the other person\'s fears, doubts, or limitations. Your friend\'s quote is spot on - people who ask those questions might not understand what it takes to achieve greatness. Instead of taking their comments personally, try to see them as a reflection of their own mindset.\\n\\nYour response to your mom, \\"what\'s wrong with dreaming big?\\" is a great start. It shows that you\'re not willing to let her doubts bring you down. To take it further, you could practice asserting yourself calmly and confidently, without feeling the need to justify or explain your goals. A simple \\"I\'m excited about this opportunity, and I\'m going to give it a shot\\" can go a long way in setting boundaries.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to surround yourself with people who support and encourage you. Having a network of positive influences can help counterbalance the negative comments and make it easier for you to stay focused on your goals.\\n\\nAs for being \\"standoff-ish,\\" it\'s not necessarily a bad thing to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries. In fact, it\'s a sign of self-awareness and self-respect. You don\'t have to choose between being standoff-ish and seeking validation; instead, focus on developing a sense of self-trust and self-compassion. That way, you\'ll be more resilient to negative comments and better equipped to make decisions that align with your values and goals.\\n\\nKeep working on your habits, exploring your interests, and seeking guidance from various sources (including God, bazi, and tarot cards - whatever works for you!). Remember that it\'s okay to take your time figuring things out, and don\'t be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks. You\'re on the right path, and with persistence and self-awareness, you\'ll get closer to achieving your dreams.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re going through a lot, but also like you\'re on the cusp of some real breakthroughs.

Some people just default to pointing out potential problems. You\'re right, you don\'t need her validation. Her comments are more about her own fears and limitations than about you. The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge her point (internally, you don\'t have to say it out loud), and then just keep doing your thing. Think of it as background noise. You can\'t control what she says, but you *can* control how you react.\\n\\nAs for being \\"standoff-ish,\\" it sounds like you\'re setting boundaries, which is healthy. You don\'t *have* to be standoffish, but you *do* have a right to protect your energy and dreams. Maybe try reframing it as being selective about who you share your goals with. Not everyone deserves to hear them.\\n\\nMoving forward, keep exploring! You\'re already doing the right things by trying different avenues to figure out what you want. Don\'t put too much pressure on yourself to have all the answers right now. It\'s a journey, not a destination.\\n\\nRegarding habits, small consistent steps are key. Celebrate the small wins, and don\'t beat yourself up over setbacks.

I keep my phone outside of my room (where my desk is) inside my bag by the front door.

Also, try to replace the habit with something else you enjoy, like reading a book or going for a walk. It might help to schedule these activities into your day so you have something to look forward to. Lastly, consider keeping your phone out of reach when you\'re working on tasks to reduce the temptation to pick it up. Remember, it\'s all about small, consistent changes. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Here\'s what helped me break the endless scrolling cycle: start by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete social media apps and only access them through your browser. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less appealing.\\n\\nNext, create \\"speed bumps\\" that make you pause before mindlessly grabbing your phone. Move social media apps into a folder on your second or third home screen. Set up app timers (both iPhone and Android have these built in). Put a rubber band or sticky note on your phone as a physical reminder to ask \\"do I really need to check this right now?\\"\\n\\nThe key is replacing the habit with something else when you need breaks. Keep a book nearby, do some quick stretches, or even just close your eyes for 2 minutes. These alternatives can still give you that mental breather without sucking you into the scroll vortex.\\n\\nStart small - try setting a 15-minute daily limit on your most-used social media app. Once that feels manageable, gradually reduce limits on other apps. You\'ll likely slip up sometimes, but that\'s normal. Just reset and try again the next day.\\n\\nRemember: your phone should be a tool that serves you, not the other way around. You\'ve already taken the first step by recognizing the issue.

You could also try removing social media apps from your phone\'s home screen or using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl to limit your access to certain sites during certain hours of the day. Another approach is to replace social media with a different habit when you feel tired or need a break, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises.

Stressed? Once you know the trigger, you can find a healthier alternative. Maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or listening to a song.\\n\\nThird, make it harder to access social media. Delete the apps from your phone and only access them on your computer (which is less convenient). Or, use app blockers to limit your time on specific apps.\\n\\nFinally, be patient with yourself.

I stopped going to the gym and all I do everyday is sit at home, play video games, watch meaningless youtube videos, and succumb to a pornography addiction that I have been trying to fight off for a while now.\\n\\nI am in my last year of university and need to take a graduate exam to move onto masters and because of this I quit my job to dedicate more hours to studying. This was 3 months ago and I have barely studied at all. And all the hours that I should be using to study are being wasted on the things I mentioned above.\\n\\nEvery time I make a promise to myself to complete a task or plan out my day to meet certain goals I always end up doing nothing. As a result of this, I stopped believing the promises I make to myself because I\'ll just end up sitting on the couch doing nothing either way. And even if I go two days while being productive I will always end up relapsing back into my rut on the third day, and if not the third day, then surely the fourth, or fifth, and so on. I can never be consistent at anything. My attention span and focus is probably less than an insect\'s. I do not respect myself and lack confidence and even if I come forward to talk about my struggles with a friend they never take me serious and ALWAYS misunderstand me.","comments":{"best_comment":"Try maybe very small. One easy task a day. Then two tasks, and so on, until you find a balance that works for you.","percentile_10_comment":"What you might need is better clarity. Rather than setting up end goals try to break down all the task into bits and pieces. What I\'m trying to say is have every step clear in your mind, strategize everything like it\'s a war you must win. Maybe write things down, every detail about how you are gonna study. How you are gonna tackle every part, be extremely practical and know your limits. Don\'t put too much expectations and stop planning out things roughly. Being specific will bring more clarity. As you start being productive into studying you can now slowly start adding workouts into your routine. When one thing is sorted and you feel productive other things would get back on track on their own.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! It sounds like you\'re going through a tough time, but the fact that you\'re reaching out for advice is a great first step. Here are a few things you might try to help get out of this rut:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small habit to change. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 10 minutes of study or going for a short walk each day. Small wins can build momentum.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Limit your time on video games and YouTube. Use apps or tools to block these distractions during study hours. This can help you focus on what you need to do.\\n\\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for study, exercise, and relaxation. Consistency can help you regain control over your day.\\n\\n4. **Accountability**: Find a study buddy or someone you trust to check in with regularly. Sharing your goals with someone else can help keep you accountable.\\n\\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It\'s okay to have setbacks. What\'s important is getting back on track. Celebrate your small victories and don\'t be too hard on yourself when things don\'t go as planned.\\n\\n6. **Professional Help**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, and it\'s okay to take it one step at a time. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off - you\'re not alone in this struggle. Many people hit similar ruts, especially during important transition periods like preparing for grad school. The good news is that you\'re aware of the patterns and actively seeking change.\\n\\nLet\'s start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE thing to focus on for the next week. Given your grad exam priority, I\'d suggest starting with studying. Set a ridiculously easy goal - like studying for just 25 minutes each morning. That\'s it. Don\'t worry about the gym or other habits yet.\\n\\nThe key is rebuilding trust with yourself through small wins. When you consistently hit that 25-minute target, you\'ll start believing in your own promises again. Use the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. During those 25 minutes, put your phone in another room and block distracting websites.\\n\\nFor the gaming and YouTube habits - don\'t try to quit cold turkey. Instead, make them rewards. After completing your study session, give yourself permission to play for a set amount of time. This helps break the cycle of guilt and creates positive reinforcement.\\n\\nRegarding consistency - forget about perfect streaks. If you miss a day, just pick up where you left off the next morning. Think of it like GPS navigation - when you take a wrong turn, it doesn\'t berate you, it just recalculates the route.\\n\\nConsider finding an accountability partner - maybe another student preparing for grad exams. Sometimes external accountability can help bridge the gap while rebuilding self-trust.\\n\\nRemember: progress isn\'t linear. Focus on taking small, consistent steps rather than massive changes. You\'ve already taken the first step by acknowledging the situation and seeking help. Now it\'s time for that 25-minute study session.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling really stuck and struggling to break out of some negative patterns. First, let\'s acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we\'re not doing well, so kudos to you for recognizing your issues and seeking help. \\n\\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as studying for 10 minutes, or going for a short walk outside. The idea is to build momentum and start to rebuild your sense of self-efficacy.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to recognize that consistency is not an all-or-nothing thing. Just because you have a setback on the third or fourth day doesn\'t mean you\'ve failed. It means you\'re human, and you\'re going to have ups and downs. The key is to learn from those setbacks and keep moving forward.\\n\\nIn terms of your studying, you might find it helpful to create a schedule and stick to it, at least for a few hours a day. Break your study sessions into smaller chunks, and take regular breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing. This can help make the process feel less overwhelming.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t give up on talking to friends about your struggles. It\'s possible that they\'re not taking you seriously because they don\'t understand what you\'re going through, but that doesn\'t mean you should stop reaching out. You might consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and supportive space to discuss your issues.\\n\\nRemember, getting out of a rut takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don\'t expect to change everything overnight. You got this, and you can start making progress one small step at a time.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re reaching out is a great first step. It\'s super common to feel this way, especially with the pressure of grad school looming.\\n\\nFirst, be kind to yourself. You\'re not alone in struggling with consistency. Instead of aiming for huge changes, try micro-wins. Seriously, tiny steps. Like, instead of \\"study for 8 hours,\\" aim for 15 minutes. Set a timer, no distractions. When it goes off, you\'re done. You can always do another 15 later if you feel up to it. The goal is to break the inertia.\\n\\nRegarding the other habits, try replacing instead of just stopping. If you\'re reaching for the video games, have a book or a quick workout ready to go instead. Even just 10 push-ups can shift your focus. For the pornography addiction, there are some great subreddits and resources out there (I can\'t link them here, but a quick search will find them) that offer support and strategies.\\n\\nAs for your friends not taking you seriously, that\'s frustrating. Maybe try framing it differently, like \\"Hey, I\'m really trying to make some changes, and I\'d appreciate it if you could just listen without judgment.\\" If they still don\'t get it, maybe find a study buddy or online community where people are working towards similar goals.\\n\\nThe key is to build momentum with small, achievable goals.

EDIT: actually, bonus, not an incel/supreme Redditor/4channer/porn addict, so i have some perks\\n\\ni mean literally nothing, not even TV/video games, just almost pure catatonia. to make things short i had a really fucked up violent childhood, neglect, most of my family passed away including my mom (who OD\'d in front of me when i was 16 and uhhh... yeah, that\'s mostly the reason why i am the way that i am now), bullying, exposure to drugs/alcohol and intimate partner violence/SERIOUS abuse, including a false accusation of S/A (she has BPD and conveniently forgot she consented to something after she found a Reddit post talking about her s3xual abuse at the end of the relationship)\\n\\nmy doctor prescribed me benzos at 15 and at 17 started taking them more and at 19 was hooked daily. i was done with life and COVID hit and i experienced some more trauma and decided fuck it and became an alcoholic drug addict NEET that didn\'t shower for weeks. i went to rehab and i\'m still recovering and am sober but feel like i\'m always going to be a fucking overgrown boy because i failed to adapt. \\n\\nif you haven\'t guessed there wasn\'t really another adult presence in my life (got handed over to an abusive adult girlfriend, basically) and my mom was always nodding off, like never really there for her last five years - i didn\'t learn anything, and skipped school but graduated with AP classes/high ACT score and somehow did 2 years of college, i missed a lot of development and i feel like i\'ll never be like everyone else, i don\'t like myself at all. and I don\'t want to make anymore excuses, i inherited the house and me and my NEET brother live alone and don\'t work, but he is still an addict\\n\\nalso yes i am in therapy, clearly. i have tried to kill myself before, but i feel hopeful now. i just feel like it\'s too late and i\'ll never learn good behaviors. :/\\n\\ni remember one day i was going downstairs to my single bare mattress on the floor, with trash all around it, plates, rotting food etc. and it was all gone because my ex cleaned it all up. i needed hospitalized in a psychiatric unit at an earlier age, but was only able to get help this year.\\n\\ni just don\'t wanna fuckin be this way anymore, such a sad pathetic existence.","comments":{"best_comment":"Hey man, I\'m not a licensed professional. But I do have someone in my life that ended up as a NEET. It hurts me so much when I think of him--because he is one of the smartest, most capable people I know. He also had trauma, and in his case he couldn\'t go out due to social anxiety.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe first thing I would do is try to change how you view yourself. It seems like you are on the right track for that--taking care of your body and mind plays a big role in that respect.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\'s true that in life, connections and background get you far. You do need to put your foot in the door to move forward. But at the end of the day, you have to acknowledge that you are in control of your future. Yes, at this point it may be harder for you to make it than it would be for someone with tons of connections. But our hardships only mean something if we decide to take them lying down.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI might recommend something--whatever you\'re trying to aim for, try and make incremental steps every day towards that goal. If for you that\'s a job, then apply to at least three-four jobs a day. No matter how shitty you feel while you\'re doing it(I know it can feel really intimidating), do it anyway. It may only take an hour or two. When you\'re done, not only can you acknowledge that you did something incredibly substantial in a short amount of time, you\'ve just improved your chances of getting a job you want. If you want to go really hard, add on top of that--you have to cold-email/message someone at a company you want to work for. Do that, and you\'re a god.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nKeep a calendar in your room, and every time you finish your step for the day, cross off a date. Do everything you can to not break your chain.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI like to hold this practice when doing something difficult for me--I count down from ten, and by the time I reach 0, I have to start the task. This gets rid of the anxiety associated with starting in the first place. This applies to social situations too--I count down from 5, and by the time I reach zero, I have to go interact with whoever I have to, whether that be a stranger, a cashier, or a long-time friend.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen doing all of this stuff, it\'s okay to sometimes struggle through the tasks. Starting and showing up are more important. HOWEVER, IMO it\'s never okay to not believe in yourself. When you\'re filling out job applications, know that one day, you will get the job you\'re looking for. That doesn\'t mean never learn from mistakes, that means have faith in the process of progress. Small steps lead to big changes over time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI really hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. I\'d recommend starting by doing something simple now, *right now*, like making your bed. See what difference it makes over time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Also, don\'t let the label of NEET define you. Yes, you are a \'NEET\' right now. But tell yourself that you only need to take more chances. Being a NEET doesn\'t mean you can\'t succeed, and don\'t believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You need to get lucky. But luck comes to those who search for it. If you try enough times, even if your success is 1 in 100, you\'ll  likely get it after 100 tries.","percentile_10_comment":"thanks\\n\\ni\'ve been through a lot of really ridiculous shit, in a really short period of time that happened to be my developing years, enough for me to think i was a bad person and better off dead. now that i\'m clear-headed i want a better future for myself, and while i don\'t think i should get life on easy mode due to my experiences, i think i deserve love and happiness. \\n\\ni\'m wanting to go back to school, and i\'m trying to take a lot of inspiration from people like Chris Gardner and my counselor in rehab who really overcame adversity - it makes me feel like there\'s hope for me. \\n\\ni just need to believe in myself, also lol never partaken in any criminal shit/been locked up, but looking at stories of successful ex-cons helps a lot. prison is a way lower place than where i am now, I\'ve got this.","gpt_comment":"Hey there, first off, I want to say that it\'s a big deal that you\'re reaching out and trying to make changes.

Maybe it\'s making your bed each morning, or a 5-minute walk outside, or reading one page of a book. The key is to keep it ridiculously simple at first.\\n\\nSince you mentioned writing skills, consider starting a simple journal. Just 5 minutes each day to track your progress and thoughts. This can help you recognize your improvements over time, which is crucial when you\'re rebuilding.\\n\\nFor work experience - look into remote writing gigs. Content writing, copywriting, or technical writing can be good entry points. Start small with platforms like Upwork or by building a portfolio on Medium. This lets you work from home while building experience.\\n\\nRemember that progress isn\'t linear. You\'ll have setbacks, and that\'s normal.

The fact that you\'re in therapy and have stopped using substances is a testament to your strength and willingness to change.\\n\\nRather than focusing on what you haven\'t learned or accomplished, try to build on the small wins you\'ve had so far. You mentioned you have skills in writing - why not start by setting aside some time each day or week to work on a writing project? It could be as simple as journaling or writing short stories. This can help you build confidence and a sense of purpose.\\n\\nIt\'s also great that you\'re recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself and your living space. Consider breaking down larger tasks, like cleaning and organizing your room, into smaller, manageable chunks.

Your therapist is there to support you, and you may also want to consider joining a support group or finding online communities of people who are going through similar experiences. Having a network of people who understand what you\'re going through can be incredibly helpful.\\n\\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself. You\'ve been through an enormous amount of trauma, and it\'s okay that you\'re not where you want to be yet. You\'re taking steps towards healing and growth, and that\'s something to be proud of.

Focus first on consistent action in a direction that aligns with your values, even if you\'re not 100% certain it\'s \\"the one.\\"","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling a bit lost and are trying to find something that truly resonates with you. First, kudos to you for exploring so many different areas - that takes a lot of courage and curiosity. One thing that stands out to me is your interest in physical sciences, which you mentioned was the last time you felt truly interested in something. Have you considered revisiting that or exploring related fields like environmental science, biotech, or even science communication? These areas could potentially align with your values of honesty and scope of influencing many people.\\n\\nAlso, it\'s great that you\'ve been watching videos on history, self-help, and other topics - sometimes our hobbies can give us clues about what we\'re passionate about. You might want to try experimenting with creating content around these topics, like writing blog posts or even just discussing them with friends, to see if that sparks any excitement.\\n\\nRegarding your idea of creating self-help videos or daily routine content on YouTube, that\'s definitely a viable option. However, instead of waiting until you\'re \\"ready,\\" why not start small and just begin creating? You could start by recording yourself talking about topics that interest you, or even just sharing your thoughts on social media. This can help you build momentum and see if it\'s something you enjoy.\\n\\nLastly, it might be helpful to reflect on what specifically is driving your desire for a sense of purpose. Is it the need to make a positive impact, to be creative, or to feel fulfilled? Once you have a clearer understanding of what\'s driving you, you can start exploring options that align with those values and goals. Keep in mind that finding your passion is a process, and it\'s okay to take your time and try different things - it\'s all part of the journey!","gemini_comment":"Okay, so you\'re feeling a bit lost at 27, which is totally normal!

That\'s a big ask, so don\'t beat yourself up if it\'s not immediately clear.\\n\\nSince you mentioned physical sciences sparked your interest, maybe revisit that. Could you take an online course or read some books to see if that feeling is still there? Even if it doesn\'t become a career, it could be a fulfilling hobby.\\n\\nAlso, you mentioned self-help videos. That aligns with your interest in helping people and your problem-solving skills. Instead of just sitting on the idea, maybe start small. Write down a few topics you\'re passionate about and outline a potential video. Even just the act of planning might give you more clarity.\\n\\nThe key is to experiment and not put too much pressure on yourself to find the \\"perfect\\" thing right away. Try to focus on small, actionable steps. Maybe dedicate 30 minutes a day to exploring one of these potential paths. Over time, you\'ll start to see which ones resonate and which ones don\'t.

I find myself escaping from my problems, and indulge myself in other (less important) activities that wastes my time. I understand it won\'t help me or be productive in anyway but i can\'t help it. \\nAfter a lot of contemplating I figured it\'s just me trying to escape from everything that\'s even mildly unpleasant. It is stagnating my growth and I\'m just sick of it.\\n\\nSo I\'ve come here asking for your help","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'d suggest to try breaking down the \'complex\' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)\\n\\nFor example: \\n\\n1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you\'re trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your \'excuse\' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. \\n\\nThe goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being \'complex\' or \'scary\'. You just see all things you did \'wrong\' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren\'t that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be \'beaten\' / fixed.\\n\\nBesides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to \'stop escaping\' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don\'t need it. Let\'s cross-check it altogether, let\'s not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you\'d like to stop escaping in first place.\\n\\n**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let\'s imagine (for example) it\'s social media. \\n\\nFine - for the list of things you \'escaped\', out of 10 things - let\'s imagine that 5 were \'escaped\' due to social media distraction. If it\'s true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it\'s something else - doesn\'t matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).\\n\\n**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before). Getting back to this same file will help you a lot, because it\'ll be your \\"center for fighting escapism\\" in some way.

One approach to tackle this is to start small and gradually build up your discipline. First, identify the specific activities you use for escapism and set limits on them. For example, if you find yourself binge-watching shows, decide on a specific time limit for watching each day. \\n\\nNext, try to replace some of that escapism time with activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or going for a walk to clear your mind. \\n\\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for the tasks you\'re avoiding. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming. Reward yourself for completing these tasks, even if it\'s just a small treat or a break to do something you enjoy. \\n\\nLastly, remember that it\'s okay to seek help if you need it. Sometimes talking to someone about what you\'re avoiding can provide new insights and motivation. Keep at it, and be patient with yourself as you work on building better habits.","claude_comment":"Escaping from challenges is a really common human response - our brains are wired to seek comfort and avoid discomfort. The key is gradually building your \\"discomfort muscle\\" rather than trying to transform overnight.\\n\\nStart by picking just ONE mildly uncomfortable but important task each day. Set a timer for just 10 minutes and commit to working on it for that short duration. When the timer goes off, you can choose to continue or stop - but usually once you start, it\'s easier to keep going.\\n\\nA helpful mindset shift is viewing discomfort as a signal of growth rather than something to avoid. When you notice yourself reaching for escape activities, pause and ask \\"What am I trying to avoid right now?\\" Then break that challenging thing into smaller, more manageable pieces.\\n\\nYou might also try the \\"if/then\\" technique: \\"If I feel the urge to escape into [activity], then I will first spend 10 minutes on [important task].\\" This creates a small barrier between the impulse and the escape behavior while building positive momentum.\\n\\nRemember that perfect discipline isn\'t the goal - progress is. Even small steps toward facing challenges instead of avoiding them will compound over time. You\'ve already taken a positive step by recognizing the pattern and seeking to change it.","llama_comment":"Escapism can be a tough cycle to break, but recognizing the pattern is a huge first step. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - what are the specific situations or emotions that make you want to escape? Once you know what\'s driving your escapism, you can start working on more constructive ways to cope with those feelings. For example, if you\'re avoiding a particular task because it feels overwhelming, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Or, if you\'re using escapism to avoid stress or anxiety, consider replacing it with a healthier habit like exercise, meditation, or journaling. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and create an environment that supports productivity - this could mean turning your phone off during certain hours of the day, or finding a quiet workspace where you can focus. Remember that it\'s okay to take breaks and indulge in enjoyable activities occasionally, but by being more mindful of your habits and setting boundaries for yourself, you can start to build more discipline and make progress on the things that matter to you.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I get it. Escapism is a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you\'ve already done the hardest part \u2013 recognizing the problem and wanting to change. That self-awareness is huge.\\n\\nInstead of trying to eliminate escapism entirely (which is super hard), maybe try to manage it and redirect that energy. Start small. Pick *one* thing you\'re avoiding and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, if you\'re avoiding studying, commit to just reading one page. Seriously, just one. Often, getting started is the biggest hurdle.\\n\\nAlso, think about *why* you\'re escaping. What\'s the unpleasant thing you\'re trying to avoid? Is it fear of failure? Boredom? Once you identify the root cause, you can start addressing that directly. Maybe that means finding a study buddy, changing your environment, or just acknowledging that it\'s okay to not be perfect.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You\'re not going to be perfect overnight. There will be days you slip up. Don\'t beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Small, consistent steps are way more effective than trying to make massive changes all at once.

It can be really frustrating when you know you need rest but just can\'t seem to get there. Here are a few things you might try:\\n\\n1. **Get out of bed for a bit**: Sometimes, just lying there can make it worse. Try getting up and doing something relaxing, like reading a book or listening to calming music, for about 15-20 minutes before trying again.\\n\\n2. **Limit screen time**: If you haven\'t already, put away your phone or any screens. The blue light can mess with your sleep cycle.\\n\\n3. **Breathing exercises**: Focus on deep, slow breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This can help calm your mind and body.\\n\\n4. **Stay cool and dark**: Make sure your room is cool and dark, which can help signal to your body that it\'s time to sleep.\\n\\n5. **Don\'t stress about it**: Easier said than done, but try not to stress about not sleeping. Sometimes just accepting that you might not get a full night\'s sleep can help you relax enough to drift off.\\n\\nFor the future, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help train your body to know when it\'s time to wind down.

Since you have 3 hours until wake-up time, your best bet is to accept tonight as a reduced sleep night and focus on getting through tomorrow while setting yourself up better for the next night.\\n\\nFor right now: Get up and do something calm and low-key for 20-30 minutes (read a book, light stretching, etc) - no screens. Then try lying down again. If sleep comes, great. If not, at least rest your body even if your mind is awake.\\n\\nFor tomorrow: Stick to your normal wake time no matter what. It\'ll be tough but pushing through will help reset your sleep schedule. During the day, get some sunlight early, maybe take a short walk. No caffeine after lunch. If you absolutely need to, a 20-minute power nap before 3PM can help, but don\'t sleep longer or it\'ll mess up tomorrow night.\\n\\nFor better sleep going forward: Set a consistent bedtime routine that starts 30-60 minutes before bed. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Regular exercise (but not right before bed) can really help too. If racing thoughts keep you up, try writing them down before bed to get them out of your head.\\n\\nThe key is not to spiral about one bad night - it happens to everyone. Focus on building good sleep habits over time rather than forcing it in the moment.","llama_comment":"When you\'re lying awake and can\'t seem to fall asleep, it can be really frustrating, especially with an early wake-up call looming. One thing that might help is trying to relax your body and mind - sometimes our brains can get stuck in overdrive when we\'re stressed about not sleeping. You could try some gentle stretches, deep breathing exercises, or even just focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. If your mind starts racing, acknowledge the thoughts but gently let them go without engaging with them. It might also be helpful to avoid screens for a bit, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep. Since you\'ve only got a few hours left before your alarm goes off, you could also try setting a timer for 20-30 minutes and telling yourself you\'ll just rest during that time - sometimes taking the pressure off of actually falling asleep can help your body relax enough to drift off. Not ideal, I know, but hopefully something in there helps you catch a bit of sleep before your wake-up time.","gemini_comment":"Okay, that sucks. Been there. Honestly, with only 3 hours left, trying to force sleep might just stress you out more. Here\'s what I\'d do *right now*:\\n\\nFirst, get out of bed. Don\'t associate your bed with being awake and frustrated. Go to another room, dim the lights, and do something *really* boring and relaxing. Think: reading a physical book (not a screen!), gentle stretching, or listening to a sleep story. No phone, no bright lights, no mentally stimulating activities.\\n\\nSecond, when you start feeling even a little bit sleepy again, head back to bed.\\n\\nFor the long term, this sounds like a sleep schedule issue. Start thinking about a consistent bedtime routine. Things like cutting caffeine after noon, making your bedroom dark and cool, and winding down with a relaxing activity an hour before bed can make a huge difference. Maybe even try a sleep app to track your sleep and see if you can identify any patterns.

My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\\n\\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who\'s the only bread winner violated me. I don\'t want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)\\n\\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I\'m not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I\'m not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing\'s different. I can\'t find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I\'d end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \\"career\\" when I don\'t want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\\n\\nI forgot to mention, I can\'t drive either. No money for classes. I\'m just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.","comments":{"best_comment":"First thing\'s first. Don\'t panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \\n\\n\\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \\n\\n\\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don\'t know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \\"!?!\\" Most people don\'t have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don\'t really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \\n\\n\\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \\n\\n\\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don\'t interest you and that you don\'t like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \\n\\n\\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \\n\\n\\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \\n\\n\\nIf you don\'t get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don\'t have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can\'t do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don\'t care what it is; don\'t let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don\'t want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \\n\\n\\n3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don\'t like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \\n\\n\\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \\n\\n\\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \\n\\n\\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \\n\\n\\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn\'t super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.","percentile_10_comment":"Check out www.selfauthoring.com They offer a series of writing exercises designed by clinical psychologists aimed at helping people to clarify a long term vision for their lives.

You can also look into local community centers or libraries for job search resources and workshops.\\n\\nAs for college, it\'s not the only path to success. Many people find fulfilling careers through vocational training or apprenticeships, which can be more affordable and quicker to complete. Look into programs that might interest you, even if it\'s just a little bit, and see if they offer any financial aid or scholarships.\\n\\nRegarding your interests, it\'s okay not to have a clear passion right now. Try exploring different fields through free online courses (like Coursera or Khan Academy) to see what might catch your attention. Sometimes, interests develop over time and with exposure to new things.\\n\\nLastly, learning to drive can open up more job opportunities. Check if there are any community programs that offer free or low-cost driving lessons. It might take some time, but setting small, achievable goals can help you build momentum.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s about taking small steps and being patient with yourself. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First, I want to acknowledge the difficult situation you\'re in, especially regarding your father. Please know there are resources and support services available - reaching out to RAINN.org can connect you with people who can help.\\n\\nNow for the practical steps forward: Your immediate priority should be becoming financially independent. While the job search has been frustrating, expand your search beyond retail. Look into:\\n- Restaurant work (dishwashing, bussing tables)\\n- Warehouse/fulfillment centers\\n- Call centers\\n- Security guard positions\\n- Package handling (UPS, FedEx)\\n\\nThese often have high turnover and frequently hire entry-level workers. Apply in person when possible and follow up on applications.\\n\\nRegarding college - yes, working and saving for college is absolutely possible. Many students do this. Community college is a much more affordable starting point, and you can transfer credits later. They also often have career counseling services that can help you explore options.\\n\\nYour shifting interests are actually pretty normal at 18. You don\'t need to have it all figured out right now. Instead of trying to find your \\"passion,\\" focus on developing practical skills that can support you while you explore different paths. Learning to code, basic office skills, or a trade can provide stable income without requiring a 4-year degree upfront.\\n\\nFor transportation, look into whether your area has job training programs - some offer assistance with getting a driver\'s license. Public transportation and bicycle commuting can work in the meantime.\\n\\nTake things one step at a time. Your first goal is finding steady income. Once you have that foundation, you\'ll have more options to explore what direction you want to take your life.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling really stuck and unsure about your future, which is totally understandable given your situation. First, let\'s break down some of the things you\'ve mentioned into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of worrying about having a \\"good plan\\" for your entire life, try focusing on what you can do in the next few weeks or months to move forward.\\n\\nYou\'ve already taken a great first step by applying to jobs, even if you haven\'t gotten any calls back yet. Consider reaching out to local non-profits or community organizations that might offer job training programs or resume-building workshops. These can be a good way to gain some skills and experience, and you might meet people who can offer valuable advice or connections.\\n\\nRegarding college, it\'s not necessary to have it all figured out right now. You could look into online courses or certification programs that interest you, even if it\'s just for a few weeks. This can help you explore different areas without committing to a full degree program. And yes, working and saving up to attend college later is a totally viable option - many people take this route and do just fine.\\n\\nAs for finding something that holds your interest, don\'t worry if you don\'t have it all figured out at 18. Lots of people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and it\'s okay to explore different paths. You might try volunteering or taking on small projects in areas that seem even slightly interesting to you - this can help you get a feel for what you enjoy without making a huge commitment.\\n\\nFinally, don\'t underestimate the power of small, incremental changes. You mentioned not being able to drive, but maybe you could start by looking into local transportation options or saving up for driving classes. It might not seem like much, but taking control of these small aspects of your life can help you build momentum and confidence.\\n\\nRemember, you don\'t have to have everything figured out right now. Just take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself as you navigate this process. You got this.","gemini_comment":"Okay, that\'s a lot to unpack, and it sounds incredibly overwhelming. First off, it\'s completely understandable that you feel stuck. You\'re 18 and facing some seriously tough circumstances. Don\'t beat yourself up for not having it all figured out.\\n\\nLet\'s break this down into smaller, more manageable steps. Forget the grand plan for now. Focus on the immediate next steps.\\n\\n1.  **Job Search:** Keep applying. CVS and Sprouts are good starting points. Expand your search to include places like fast food restaurants, grocery stores (stocking shelves), warehouses, or even cleaning services. These often have high turnover and are more likely to hire someone without experience. Tailor your resume to each job, highlighting any skills you *do* have, even if they seem small (e.g., \\"organized household chores,\\" \\"helped family with computer issues\\"). Even volunteering counts!\\n\\n2.  **Skills & Resume:** Since you\'re having trouble getting callbacks, consider free online courses to boost your resume. Websites like Coursera, edX, and even YouTube have tons of free courses on everything from basic computer skills to customer service. Completing even a short course shows initiative.\\n\\n3.  **Transportation:** This is a tough one without money. Look into public transportation options in your area. Even if it\'s limited, it\'s better than nothing. Also, see if there are any local programs that offer assistance with transportation for job seekers.\\n\\n4.  **College:** College is a great goal, but it doesn\'t have to be right now. Working and saving *does* work, but it takes time and discipline. Start small. Set a realistic savings goal each month, even if it\'s just $25.\\n\\n5.  **Interests:** The \\"interest hopping\\" is common at your age. Don\'t pressure yourself to find your \\"passion\\" right now. Instead, try new things without the expectation of loving them forever. Libraries often have free workshops and events. Community centers might offer affordable classes. Just explore!\\n\\n6.  **Dysfunctional Family:** This is the hardest part. Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel unsafe, reach out to a trusted friend, family member (if possible), or a local support organization. There are resources available to help you navigate this.\\n\\nThe key here is to break down these big problems into smaller, actionable steps. Focus on one thing at a time. Celebrate small victories. And remember, it\'s okay to ask for help. You\'re not alone in this.\\n"}},{"id":"t3_13ae213","title":"[NEED ADVICE] I feel like im not even living anymore due to my addictions I\u2019m trapped I\u2019m going I\u2019m circles I die of boredom please help me please read","body":"I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m at a loss. I do not know how to start. I have idea and I am ambitious I can feel it. I\u2019ve gotten so lazy even though I work 6 days a week im usually always on my phone. My job is easy. I don\u2019t even know how im still hired there. I\u2019m so addicted to food. I\u2019m so consumed by my phone. I\u2019ve gotten so lazy I just do the minimum. I take 1-2 classes a quarter. I workout and eat just good enough to maintain the hard work and fitness I have worked for over the years. I make sure I am hygienic and clean. I have no motivation to do more than the minimum. I barely holding on. Procrastinating everything. I just can\u2019t believe I spend a majority of my day staring at this fucking phone an average of 6-8 hours screen time. SIX TO EIGHT HOURS SCREEN TIME EVERYDAY . Like im zoned in and unaware of the real world. I take medication for adhd 5 days a week. Im a mess. I am trying to read more books and learn more. I just don\u2019t know how to do this.\\n\\n\\nI have this notebook. I am writing down all my goals and bullet points on how I can achieve those goals then everyday I wanna write down my plans /to do list for the day. I also wanna use this to journal rather than use my notes app. I will still use my notes app but not as much.\\nI know I need to first fix my sleep. I THINK I can do that since I can look forward to sleep if im actually tired. So I think I can get that down. I know 2nd I need to reduce my\\nScreen time.

How to stop thinking of food when I am legitimately addicted to food and can\u2019t stop thinking of it.  I wanna start now but I feel stuck. I can\u2019t explain it I feel trapped . I feel trapped. I\u2019m trapped. I stay stuck with these addictions and not changing, this I stay trapped.

I\u2019m just jotting down thoughts as they come so this might not be very organized, but the lessons/ ideas should still come thru. If you find this helpful and want me to clarify or add more things I\u2019ve tried just reply back\\n\\nI think brain hacks can help, but it seems like different ones will work at different times of your life and work for some and don\u2019t work for others.\\n\\nI have had varying degrees of laziness and problems with motivation throughout my life.\\n\\nI\u2019ve gone through periods where I\u2019ve had nothing going on, playing video games all day and not even being able to have a sleeping routine. I tried so many ways during this period to be more productive and get out of the rut, but was unsuccessful. During this period I realized that I only was able to do things out of necessity. I had to have some kind of commitment that I was locked into and had to work towards. Like having a job that you force yourself to show up for because you don\u2019t want to let people down and need the money. After learning this I went to the extreme and locked myself into a contract with the Air Force. I knew that once in I wouldn\u2019t be able to just quit and I\u2019d be forced to take action because there wasn\u2019t another choice. My point is, you don\u2019t need to join the military, but if you can find commitments in your life that would force you to take action maybe this could be a step in the right direction and possible solution to force yourself out of a rut.\\n\\nAt other points in my life the power of positive thinking helped. I read countless books over the course of years before I actually understood exactly what this meant. Anytime you look up how to get motivated or disciplined or whatever you get the same answers. Mindfulness, gratitude, positive thinking. I was always left thinking this is some blanket statement thrown out that didn\u2019t actually mean anything and certainly didn\u2019t help. Maybe there\u2019s some truth to that, but regardless here\u2019s what I learned worked for me in this realm. To me, It\u2019s the process of changing your identity and reinforcing it. If you tell yourself and believe that you\u2019re in shape or an athlete, it\u2019s much easier to talk yourself into regular exercise because you believe the act of exercise is to the core of who you are. So anytime you are about to do something productive start by saying I am this, and then reinforce it with the actual act. Before you workout tell yourself I am an athlete and then reinforce it to yourself by exercising even if it\u2019s for 10 min. Another example, tell yourself you a disciplined person and then read 10 pages of a book. Tell yourself you are mentally strong and then take a 2 min cold shower. It might sound crazy, but I\u2019ve really noticed a difference after just a few weeks of doing this. You don\u2019t need to do a half hour meditation routine everyday to reap the benefits of positive self talk.\\n\\nOn this topic, at one point of my life I was so miserable that all of my thoughts were negative. I would hold onto any failure or things I didn\u2019t accomplish and beat myself up for it. This process of constantly thinking about the negative made me feel so much worst. I found out how much it was affecting me because one day on my way home from work I finally snapped and silenced my mind. Anytime I had a negative thought I would just shut it out. I would literally tell myself to shut up. I felt better immediately. Since then I\u2019ve made a rule to just never think negative thoughts, I just have never found a time when they\u2019ve been useful.\\n\\nWhile constantly researching and trying things to change my discipline my process would usually go like this. I would learn one thing, try it, maybe it helped a bit. I\u2019d forget about it look up some new technique, maybe it worked, forget about it. Rinse, repeat. I\u2019ve learned that being organized and having things written down and having reminders helps to stay consistent. \\n\\nWhat helps me to do this is to always be running a 30 day challenge. I print out a habit tracker every month with a box for each action on each day to check off. I hold myself accountable by doing this with my partner and it has become a rivalry between us. We put conditions for the challenge where if one of us doesn\u2019t check all the boxes in a day we have to do the punishment of the others choosing. For me if I don\u2019t do my list I have to watch a marvel movie (which I hate) funny enough this has been a huge deterrent from me not completing my list. Not because the movie would be such a bad thing, but more out of stubbornness to not give my partner the satisfaction lol. One more thing to add I. This is to include things on your challenge that are obtainable and work yourself up each month. Discipline is like a muscle you have to work out to get continually stronger. You can\u2019t go from being completely undisciplined one day to having completely disciplined the next. You have to work yourself up to it. Make sure to include things on the challenge like positive reinforcements before each task.\\n\\nOne of my items on my list is to create a \u201ctime box\u201d for each day. This is a daily timed planner that outlines what I need to do for the day and at what time I need to accomplish it by. Keeps me organized and not save everything for the later part of the day so I don\u2019t have to do everything at one time.\\n\\nFinally give yourself some grace. It\u2019s not easy to do these things, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Just remember that you are not alone, most people deal with the same things. Perspective is key, change the way you see things. Don\u2019t say things like I have to go to work say I get to go to work, at least you have a job. Instead of saying I have to drive my busted up car say I get to drive my car, at least you have one, many people don\u2019t. Chances are you are probably in a better spot than you think in comparison to how things could be. Be grateful for who you are and what you have. You could be sick and not able to do anything. I saw a video the other day that had someone asking if I offered to give you 10 million dollars would you take it. Everyone of course said yes. He then said okay I could give you this 10 million dollars, but you\u2019ll only live for another week. Everyone then changed their mind. It stuck with me. I\u2019m grateful to be healthy and though the money would be nice I\u2019m happy to be healthy.","percentile_10_comment":"Thank you. I am trying one day at a time. The food thing is very hard as well as the phone. I\u2019ve improved in some aspects, we pray 5x a day in our religion and I became a looot more consistent with that, I quit alcohol and drug phase from high school, more consistency with school, the medication helped me reduce my binge eating so I don\u2019t feel as depressed and lost weight. \\n\\nI just feel like when some things are good, there are still a million things that are bad. Like sure I improved in these areas, but then I\u2019m addressed with so much more responsibility and possibly getting married , and dealing with family and stress and I look around seeing an unorganized room when i know I have time to clean I\u2019m just lazy.  Procrastinating important things. It scares me for the future especially for marriage. \\n\\nI appreciate your time to post this. I think food and screen time are my biggest weaknesses for now. Too much entertainment makes  the rest of life so dull. I will try to reduce carbs possibly try keto again and try to find other things to do aside from this stupid addictive phone.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out and looking to make changes. It sounds like you\'re already on the right track with some solid ideas, like using a notebook for goals and setting screen time limits. Here are a few more tips that might help:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: It\u2019s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one habit to focus on first, like reducing screen time or improving sleep, and build from there.\\n\\n2. **Pomodoro Technique**: This can be a game-changer for dealing with boredom and procrastination. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It can make tasks feel less daunting and help you stay focused.\\n\\n3. **Find Alternatives**: Replace phone time with something engaging but less addictive. Try podcasts, audiobooks, or even a new hobby that doesn\u2019t involve screens.\\n\\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a big focus, try to eat mindfully. Pay attention to your meals without distractions, which can help reduce cravings and make eating more satisfying.\\n\\n5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community where you can check in regularly. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can boost motivation.\\n\\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for small achievements. It can be as simple as enjoying a favorite snack or taking a relaxing bath.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, and it\u2019s okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You\u2019ve got this!","claude_comment":"Hey there - I really get the struggle with phone addiction and boredom. Let me share some practical \\"brain hacks\\" that can help you break free from this cycle.\\n\\nFirst, for the phone addiction: Install an app like Forest that gamifies staying off your phone. When you want to focus, you plant a virtual tree that grows while you don\'t touch your phone - if you break focus, the tree dies. It sounds simple, but it taps into our brain\'s reward systems in a positive way. Start with just 25 minute growing sessions.\\n\\nFor dealing with the crushing boredom: Your brain is currently wired to expect constant stimulation from social media. You need to gradually rewire it. Start with very short periods away from your phone - even just 5-10 minutes. During these breaks, do something physical that engages your senses - take a walk, do some stretches, or even just make tea mindfully. The key is to make it through those initial uncomfortable moments.\\n\\nAbout the food addiction: Keep a \\"craving journal\\" where you note the time, intensity, and what triggered each craving. This helps separate the physical hunger from emotional eating. When cravings hit, try the \\"urge surfing\\" technique - observe the craving like a wave that will eventually pass instead of fighting it.\\n\\nFor getting tasks done: Use the \\"5-minute rule.\\" Tell yourself you only have to work on something for 5 minutes. Usually, once you start, you\'ll naturally want to continue. If not, that\'s fine - you still made progress. The key is making the initial barrier tiny.\\n\\nThese aren\'t instant fixes, but they\'re proven techniques that work with your brain\'s natural patterns instead of against them. Start implementing just one of these today - maybe the Forest app or the 5-minute rule. Small wins build momentum.\\n\\nRemember: You\'re not trapped - you\'re in transition. Every time you resist an urge or focus for even a few minutes, you\'re literally rewiring your brain\'s reward pathways. It gets easier with practice.","llama_comment":"I can feel your desperation and frustration, and I\'m here to offer some suggestions that might help. First, it\'s great that you\'ve identified the areas you want to improve, such as reducing screen time, fixing your sleep, and developing a healthier relationship with food. Those are all excellent starting points. \\n\\nOne strategy that might help you deal with boredom is to start small and make your tasks more manageable. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, break down your goals into tiny, almost ridiculously easy tasks. For example, if you want to start reading more, commit to reading for just 5-10 minutes a day. If you want to work on a project, start by dedicating 15-20 minutes to it each day. This can help build momentum and make the task less overwhelming.\\n\\nAnother approach is to find ways to make your tasks more engaging. If you\'re bored with a particular activity, try to find a way to make it more interesting. For example, if you\'re trying to learn something new, watch videos or listen to podcasts on the topic instead of just reading about it. If you\'re working on a project, try to find a way to make it more creative or challenging.\\n\\nTo resist the temptation of your phone, you might consider implementing some physical barriers, such as putting your phone in a different room or using a website blocker. You could also try replacing your phone time with other activities that bring you joy, such as drawing, journaling, or taking a walk.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to remember that it\'s okay to feel bored sometimes, and it doesn\'t mean you\'re failing. It\'s normal for our brains to wander and get distracted, especially when we\'re trying to develop new habits. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge the feeling and gently bring your focus back to the task at hand.\\n\\nLastly, consider seeking out accountability and support from friends, family, or a therapist. Having someone to talk to and share your struggles with can make a big difference in staying motivated and on track.\\n\\nRemember, developing discipline and breaking addictions is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You\'re not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you. Keep moving forward, even if it\'s just a tiny step at a time.","gemini_comment":"Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re reaching out and already planning some changes is a huge first step. You\'re not alone in this struggle.\\n\\nFirst off, that notebook idea is solid. Writing things down makes them real. Start small with your daily plans \u2013 maybe just 2-3 key tasks. Don\'t overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nAbout the boredom... you\'re right, just \\"sucking it up\\" doesn\'t work. You need to actively replace the addictive stuff with something else. Since you\'re already working out, maybe try timing your workouts and trying to beat your personal best. Gamify it. Or, since you\'re reading more, try finding books that are super engaging, like thrillers or mysteries, to really pull you in. Audiobooks can also be great for when you\'re doing chores or walking.\\n\\nFor the phone addiction, the screen time restrictions are good, but also think about *why* you\'re reaching for it. Is it boredom? Loneliness? Stress? If you can identify the trigger, you can find a healthier coping mechanism. Maybe it\'s a quick walk, a few minutes of meditation, or calling a friend.\\n\\nFood is tough. You\'re on the right track with cutting out the junk food. Instead of focusing on what you *can\'t* have, focus on what you *can* have. Explore new healthy recipes. Make cooking an activity. And don\'t beat yourself up if you slip up \u2013 just get back on track with the next meal.\\n\\nAs for staying consistent, try the \\"two-minute rule.\\" If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. It\'s a small win that can build momentum. Also, celebrate your small victories. Did you resist the urge to check your phone for an hour? Awesome! Acknowledge it.\\n\\nFinally, remember that discipline isn\'t about being perfect; it\'s about progress. You\'re going to have bad days. The key is to not let those bad days derail you completely. Just keep showing up and trying your best.

Additionally, consider setting aside some time for self-reflection to understand what\'s causing your stress when you think about taking action - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you identify the root cause, you can start working on strategies to overcome it. Remember, progress might be slow at first, but it\'s better than staying stuck. You got this, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time.","gemini_comment":"Hey man, I get it. Feeling stuck is a really tough place to be. It sounds like you\'re overwhelmed by the sheer number of things you want to change, and that\'s causing you to freeze up.\\n\\nInstead of trying to tackle everything at once, how about picking *one* small thing to focus on this week? Seriously, just one. Maybe it\'s spending 15 minutes researching potential majors, or watching a YouTube video about driving. The key is to make it something so small that it feels almost effortless.\\n\\nOnce you\'ve done that one small thing, give yourself credit! Acknowledge that you took action. Then, next week, try to build on that. Maybe research majors for 30 minutes, or schedule a driving lesson.\\n\\nThe idea is to build momentum and confidence. Small wins can really add up over time. Don\'t beat yourself up for not being perfect; just focus on making a little bit of progress each day.

At 24, you definitely don\'t need to have everything figured out, and it\'s okay to be a jack-of-all-trades. However, if you\'re feeling stretched thin, it might be helpful to prioritize. Consider which hobbies bring you the most joy or fulfillment and focus on those for a while. You can always revisit other interests later. It\'s not about picking one thing forever, but about giving yourself the space to dive deeper into what truly resonates with you right now. As for books, \\"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World\\" by David Epstein might offer some valuable insights. Remember, it\'s all about finding a balance that works for you. Good luck!","claude_comment":"There\'s absolutely nothing wrong with being a jack-of-all-trades at 24 - or any age, really. Having diverse interests makes you well-rounded and adaptable, which are huge assets both personally and professionally. \\n\\nThat said, your question about focusing makes sense given your limited time. Instead of completely dropping interests, consider cycling through them seasonally or quarterly. You could dedicate 3-4 months to really diving deep into one area while maintaining lighter involvement in others. This lets you progress meaningfully in each interest without totally abandoning the rest.\\n\\nFor example, you might focus on music for a quarter, then switch to fitness, then theater, etc. This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the depth of focused practice and the breadth of varied interests.\\n\\nThe book \\"Range\\" by David Epstein actually tackles this topic head-on. He makes a strong case for how generalists often thrive in our complex world. Another good read is \\"Refuse to Choose\\" by Barbara Sher, which specifically addresses managing multiple passions.\\n\\nRemember that your diverse background isn\'t a weakness - it\'s given you a unique perspective and skill set. The goal isn\'t to become narrowly specialized unless that truly calls to you. Instead, find a sustainable way to nurture your various interests while going deeper into each one at different times.\\n\\nYour approach to staying single while figuring things out is smart.

For example, if music is a big passion of yours, you could dedicate a few hours each week to playing an instrument or attending concerts, and then occasionally attend a football game or try out a new punk rock venue.\\n\\nIn terms of books, you might find \\"Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less\\" by Greg McKeown helpful. It\'s all about learning to prioritize what\'s truly important and eliminating non-essential activities.

To start building a different mindset, I\'d recommend beginning with small, manageable tasks that you can accomplish daily. This will help you build momentum and confidence. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your goals into tiny, bite-sized chunks. For example, if you want to start exercising, commit to doing just 5-10 minutes of stretching or a short walk each day. As you consistently complete these small tasks, you\'ll start to develop a sense of discipline and productivity that can then be applied to larger goals.

The key is to shift from relying on motivation to building sustainable habits and systems.\\n\\nA few things that have worked well for maintaining long-term consistency:\\n\\nStart smaller than you think you need to. Instead of going all-out for 2-3 weeks, begin with a minimal routine you can definitely stick to (even 15-20 mins). You can always build up gradually.\\n\\nHave a clear \\"if-then\\" plan for your morning workouts. The more automatic you make it, the less willpower you need. Lay out clothes the night before, keep your gym bag ready, etc. Make the path of least resistance lead to working out.\\n\\nAccept that some days will feel \\"meh\\" and that\'s totally fine. You don\'t need to crush every workout. Simply showing up and doing something, even if it\'s lighter than usual, maintains the habit. Consistency > intensity.\\n\\nWhen you feel burnout coming, scale back instead of stopping completely. Do shorter workouts or lighter days, but keep the routine. It\'s much easier to maintain momentum than to start over.\\n\\nTrack your consistency rather than just results. Use a simple habit tracker or calendar. Seeing your streak can be motivating, and it helps identify patterns in when/why you tend to fall off.\\n\\nThe morning workout choice is smart - fewer disruptions and excuses.

It sounds like you\'re experiencing a common pattern - starting strong with motivation, but then hitting a wall and struggling to maintain consistency. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Instead of trying to be \\"all-in\\" all the time, try to make your workouts a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. \\n\\nAlso, since you mentioned you prefer early morning workouts, try to make that time as convenient and enjoyable as possible. Lay out your workout clothes the night before, prep your breakfast, and find a playlist or podcast that gets you pumped up. As for avoiding burnout, consider incorporating rest days or active recovery into your routine, like a light yoga session or a walk. This can help your body and mind recharge, making it easier to stick to your workouts in the long run. \\n\\nLastly, try to focus on progress rather than perfection. It\'s okay to have off days or weeks, but don\'t let that derail you completely. Get back on track as soon as you can, and remind yourself why you started working out in the first place. You\'ve already identified what works for you (early morning workouts), now it\'s just a matter of making it a sustainable habit.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get where you\'re coming from. That initial motivation is awesome, but it\'s a beast to maintain! Here\'s what\'s helped me stick with it long-term:\\n\\nFirst, ditch the \\"all-in\\" mentality. It\'s a recipe for burnout. Think sustainable, not spectacular. Instead of aiming for intense workouts every day, try scaling back. Maybe 3 days a week with shorter, less intense sessions. Consistency trumps intensity, especially in the long run.\\n\\nSecond, build in some flexibility. Life happens. Instead of letting a missed workout derail you for weeks, have a backup plan. Maybe a quick bodyweight circuit at home if you can\'t make it to the gym, or even just a brisk walk. The goal is to keep the momentum going, even if it\'s just a little bit.\\n\\nThird, find something you genuinely enjoy. If you dread your workouts, you\'re less likely to stick with them. Experiment with different activities until you find something that feels less like a chore and more like something you look forward to.\\n\\nFinally, track your progress. Seeing how far you\'ve come can be a huge motivator. It doesn\'t have to be anything fancy \u2013 just a simple log of your workouts. When you feel like giving up, look back at your progress and remind yourself of how much you\'ve already accomplished.

After a short study session, give yourself a small reward, like a quick walk or a snack. This can help train your brain to associate effort with positive outcomes.\\n\\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you\'ve already uninstalled social media, maybe try setting specific times for gaming or phone use. This way, you can enjoy them without them taking over your day.\\n\\n5. **Seek Support**: If possible, talk to someone about how you\'re feeling.

The constant need for stimulation, difficulty with tasks requiring sustained effort, and struggles with executive function are classic signs. Getting properly evaluated by a mental health professional would be a good first step.\\n\\nBut you\'re definitely not hopeless. Let\'s focus on what you can do right now to start turning things around:\\n\\nFirst, accept that cold turkey approaches like locking away your computer probably won\'t work long-term. Instead, start incredibly small. Pick ONE 10-minute block each day where you\'ll study. That\'s it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast. The goal isn\'t productivity - it\'s just building the tiny habit of showing up.\\n\\nFor gaming, set a strict timer for 1 hour of play. When it goes off, you must do something else for at least 15 minutes before gaming again. This helps break the compulsive cycle while still allowing some enjoyment.\\n\\nYour brain is clearly crying out for dopamine hits. Give it some through healthier channels - take a 10 minute walk, do 5 pushups, or spend 5 minutes practicing an instrument. These build in natural rewards that aren\'t as intense as gaming but are more sustainable.\\n\\nFor the final exams - break everything into absurdly small chunks. Don\'t think \\"study chapter 5.\\" Think \\"read one page\\" or \\"do two practice problems.\\" String these micro-tasks together and you\'ll build momentum.\\n\\nThe key is to stop fighting your brain\'s need for stimulation and instead work with it.

Take it one tiny step at a time.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re dealing with a really tough combination of challenges, and it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for help. First, let\'s acknowledge that this doesn\'t sound like simple laziness - the fact that you\'ve tried various methods to stay on track and are still struggling suggests there may be some underlying issues at play, possibly related to ADHD or other mental health concerns. \\n\\nGiven your struggles with focus and procrastination, it might be helpful to start small and work on building tiny habits that you can actually stick to. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one thing you want to work on - like studying for your exams or practicing a musical instrument - and commit to doing it for just 5-10 minutes a day. That\'s it. Don\'t worry about being productive or achieving some big goal, just focus on showing up and doing the thing for that short amount of time.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth considering seeking out professional help, whether that\'s a therapist or a doctor who can help you explore the possibility of ADHD or other underlying conditions. They may be able to provide you with more targeted strategies and support to help you get back on track.\\n\\nAs for your hobbies, it might be helpful to try to rekindle some of that old spark - not by feeling like you need to create something perfect, but just by doing the thing for its own sake. So, instead of trying to make a funny video, just mess around with video editing software for a bit and see what happens. You might find that it helps you tap into some of that creative energy and motivation.\\n\\nLastly, be kind to yourself - it\'s okay to not have everything figured out right now, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time.

A diagnosis (or ruling it out) can give you clarity and open doors to appropriate strategies and support. Don\'t self-diagnose, but definitely explore it with a doctor or therapist.\\n\\nSecond, let\'s tackle the procrastination and lack of focus. Three months is still enough time to make a difference for your exams. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick *one* subject and commit to studying it for just 15 minutes each day. Seriously, just 15. Use a timer. The goal isn\'t to master the subject in 15 minutes, it\'s to break the inertia and build a habit. Once you\'re consistently doing 15 minutes, gradually increase it.\\n\\nThird, address the video game issue. Cold turkey might not be sustainable. Instead, try setting strict time limits and only allowing yourself to play *after* you\'ve completed your study goal for the day. Make it a reward, not a default. Also, actively seek out alternative activities. Remember those musical instruments and video editing? Even if you don\'t feel the \\"knack\\" right away, force yourself to spend 30 minutes on one of them. The joy might return with practice.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You\'re not lazy, you\'re struggling. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Celebrate small wins. And remember, progress isn\'t linear. There will be setbacks, but don\'t let them derail you. Get back on track the next day.

And how can you make the good choices easier to do?\\n\\nIt\'s gonna take time to break bad habits, but it should get better once you start seeing some results.","percentile_10_comment":"One step further: actually reward yourself. When I started running I rewarded myself with a TV show I wasn\'t allowing myself to watch until the run, or a chocolate protein shake (I love chocolate).

It sounds like you\'re going through a lot right now, and it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice. Making the harder but better choice often starts with small, manageable steps. Here are a few ideas that might help:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one area to focus on first. Maybe it\'s reducing Uber Eats orders or setting a small budget for groceries. Small wins can build momentum.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what \\"better\\" looks like for you. Is it cooking one meal at home per day? Walking for 10 minutes? Having a tidy room? Clear goals can guide your actions.\\n\\n3. **Create a Routine**: Establish a simple daily routine. It could be as basic as waking up at the same time, making your bed, or having a set time for meals. Routines can provide structure and reduce decision fatigue.\\n\\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community (like this one!) to keep you accountable. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can make a big difference.\\n\\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and setbacks happen. Don\'t beat yourself up over them. Acknowledge the slip and refocus on your goals.\\n\\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Making better choices is tough because our brains are wired to take the path of least resistance. The key isn\'t willpower - it\'s about making the better choice the easier choice through small, strategic changes.\\n\\nStart with just one thing. Looking at your situation, I\'d suggest tackling the food/Uber Eats cycle first since it impacts both your health and finances. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on prepping just one meal the night before work. When you\'re tired after your shift, you\'ll already have food ready - making the healthier choice the convenient one.\\n\\nFor the morning Uber rides, pack your work bag and lay out clothes the night before. This removes decision fatigue and makes it easier to catch regular transportation. Small prep steps like this reduce the mental friction that leads to costly convenience choices.\\n\\nAbout the gaming laptop - hold off for now. Put that money toward clearing any food delivery debt and creating a small emergency fund. Gaming can be a great hobby, but timing matters.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to stop viewing discipline as an all-or-nothing proposition. You don\'t need to transform overnight. Pick one small change, make it stupid easy to do, and build from there. Each tiny win creates momentum for the next one.\\n\\nWant a concrete first step? Tonight, take 10 minutes to prep tomorrow\'s lunch. That\'s it. One meal, one day. Then come back here and let us know how it went. Sometimes the hardest part is just starting.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling overwhelmed by the number of areas in your life where you\'d like to see improvement, and that\'s completely understandable. One strategy that might help is to focus on making one or two small changes at a time, rather than trying to tackle everything all at once. For example, you could start by committing to cook one meal at home each day using ingredients you already have, instead of ordering Uber Eats. Or, you could try setting aside 10 minutes each morning to tidy up your room and get yourself organized for the day. \\n\\nAs for why it\'s hard to choose the better option, it\'s often because our brains are wired to prioritize short-term comfort and convenience over long-term benefits. But the good news is that discipline is like a muscle that can be developed over time with practice and consistency. It might help to identify the underlying reasons why you\'re making certain choices - for instance, are you using food as a coping mechanism because you\'re stressed or bored? Once you understand what\'s driving your behaviors, you can start working on alternative solutions that address those underlying needs.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it\'s okay to take things one step at a time. You don\'t have to have it all figured out right now, and it\'s great that you\'re taking the first step by recognizing the changes you want to make. Consider seeking out some additional resources or support to help you on your journey - there are many books, podcasts, and online communities dedicated to helping people develop healthier habits and improve their discipline. Keep in mind that small wins can add up over time, and it\'s okay to celebrate those tiny victories along the way.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re going through a tough time, but the fact that you\'re recognizing these issues at 4:40 AM on a Sunday shows you\'ve got the self-awareness to turn things around.

Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on this week. Seriously, just one. Maybe it\'s cutting back on Uber Eats. Could you commit to cooking just one extra meal at home this week? Or maybe it\'s taking a short walk each day, even if it\'s just around the block, to help with the joint pain and get you moving.\\n\\nSmall wins build momentum. Once you\'ve got one small habit going, you can add another.

Quite the opposite - I struggle with hypersomnia. Basically given the option I will seek out sleep and desire it pretty much all the time. It\'s unique from simply being \\"tired\\". I\'ve had days where for one reason or another I didn\'t get good sleep and I can differentiate between \\"I did not get quality sleep\\" and \\"I have gotten plenty of sleep but still feel sleepy\\". \\n\\nThus far all medical explanations have fallen flat. Because I don\'t just fall asleep in any position it\'s not narcolepsy. Frankly I think it\'s mostly behavioral that stems from past depression (when I slept a lot simply for lack of desire to do anything else). That depression has waned but the sleep issue persists. It interferes with work (I can near automatically shut off alarms even when I add obstacles, I can fall into a nap after laying down only a minute or two, and so I tend to overslept and miss even things I want to do). \\n\\nThings I\'ve tried: I try covering my bed with stuffed animals during the day as a deterent but they\'re easy to toss aside. I try keeping myself generally bust during the day though this isn\'t always practical (and doesn\'t help in the morning when the battle is hardest). Anything I would use to stay awake when I reach the point where my brain says \\"sleep\\" I will just remove them to get the sleep. Even if I know I will feel worse afterward (for those who don\'t know if you get too much REM you can become essentially \\"sleep drunk\\" and it\'s not enjoyable or helpful).","comments":{"best_comment":">Because I don\'t just fall asleep in any position it\'s not narcolepsy. \\n\\nThat doesn\'t mean it\'s not narcolepsy. Have you seen an actual sleep specialist?","percentile_10_comment":"It sounds like you need a sleep study, both a PSG and MSLT. I have narcolepsy and it basically means your brain doesn\u2019t regulate your sleep-wake cycle appropriately. Narcolepsy can also just mean that you feel sleepy almost all the time (this is more or less how it is for me) or may even have sleep attacks (the unmistakable feeling that you just have to take a nap right now) or it can be some of both. The image of a person just suddenly collapsing into sleep is due to severe cataplexy which is a defining feature of narcolepsy type 1, and what the brain is doing is slipping into REM as a result of an emotional response. That person is also simultaneously conscious and awake. When you go into REM your muscles kind of weaken and paralyze so you don\u2019t act out your dreams, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with cataplexy. It can also be very mild where one might feel their legs weaken or knees buckle when laughing or when someone get frustrated and they drop whatever is in their hand because they lose muscle grip. Narcolepsy type 2 generally looks like being excruciatingly sleepy all day. I have type 1, my sister has type 2. We\u2019re both really damn sleepy but also sleepy in slightly different ways. Narcolepsy can come with it\u2019s own insomnia feature of feeling most awake at night. But that\u2019s just part of the sleep-wake cycle dysregulation. People with narcolepsy are also likely to have too much REM sleep and skip the deep sleep stage. And you don\u2019t need all the symptoms, you could literally just be sleepy all the time and be diagnosed with it. Then there is also narcolepsy\u2019s cousin idiopathic hypersomnia which is basically \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, but you\u2019re just pathologically sleepy\u201d. It can look a lot like narcolepsy and narcolepsy can look a lot like it. Depression is common for both. Both disorders can be diagnosed and medicated.\\n\\nI chose to not take meds because I get a lot of side effects from stimulants, so I manage with lifestyle choices. The biggest one for me is diet. Too many carbs and sugar and I\u2019ll be a sleepy zombie. Too much pizza for dinner will result in being completely unproductive the following day. Caffeine too late into the afternoon, after 3pm will diminish my quality of sleep that night. I\u2019ll sleep but my quality of sleep is terrible. Exercising and staying active is extremely difficult and too much can put me under, but just doing light exercise will help in the long run once I\u2019m in the habit and get over the initial sleepiness hurdles. Anything drowsy inducing is off limits, avoid meds with drowsiness as a side effect which sucks when you have allergies, although antibiotics are unavoidable, and limit alcohol or just don\u2019t drink at all. Knowing how much to sleep has helped tremendously. I function best at between 6-7 hours, less and I feel like hell, and more than 8 and I have sleep drunkenness all day and feel a different kind of hell. You can try to experiment with any of those.\\n\\nBut seriously, get yourself to a doctor and request a sleep study if you need a referral. Ask for both a PSG and a MSLT. Have a two week sleep log ready to go, and you can even show up with a self-administered Epworth Sleepiness Scale results. If your score is in the 8-10 range that\u2019s common for sleep apnea, if you\u2019re in the 17+ range you\u2019re in the narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia range. Feel free to drop on by the narcolepsy sub in which we support folks with IH also. I\u2019ve heard your story dozens of times, it\u2019s common in our community.

This could be something simple like a favorite breakfast, a short walk, or listening to music. The key is to create a positive association with waking up.\\n\\n2. **Light Exposure**: Increase your exposure to natural light, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your circadian rhythm and signal to your body that it\'s time to be awake.\\n\\n3. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some form of physical activity into your day.

Good luck!","claude_comment":"Since you\'ve ruled out medical causes, let\'s focus on breaking this behavioral pattern through environmental and habit changes. First, make your bed completely inaccessible during the day - not just covered with stuffed animals, but stripped of blankets and pillows. Store these in a closet or another room. This creates a much stronger barrier than items you can easily move aside.\\n\\nFor mornings, place your alarm across the room and pair it with immediate exposure to bright light - either natural sunlight or a smart bulb that turns on with your alarm. The key is making the transition from sleep to wake more decisive. As soon as you\'re up, do something physically engaging like 5 jumping jacks or walking to the kitchen for a glass of water.\\n\\nThroughout the day, try the \\"5-minute rule\\" when you feel the urge to nap. Tell yourself you\'ll do just 5 minutes of any activity (stretching, walking, organizing) before deciding about sleep. Often the urge passes once you\'re engaged in something else. Keep a log of times when you feel most sleepy and what you were doing just before - this can help identify triggers.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to maintain a consistent wake time, even on weekends. Your body will gradually adjust to expect wakefulness at certain times. When you do feel the need to rest, set a strict 20-minute timer for naps and only take them before 3pm.\\n\\nRemember that breaking this pattern will feel uncomfortable at first, but each day you resist unnecessary sleep helps rewire your brain\'s expectations.

Given your history with depression, it\'s possible that sleep has become a coping mechanism or a deeply ingrained habit for you. \\n\\nOne strategy you might consider is setting up a consistent wake-up routine that doesn\'t involve immediately getting back into bed. This could be as simple as making yourself a cup of coffee or tea, taking a short walk outside, or doing some light stretching. The goal is to create a clear distinction between sleep time and wake time, and to give yourself a sense of purpose and momentum in the morning.\\n\\nYou\'ve also mentioned that you tend to oversleep and miss out on things you want to do, which suggests that there may be some underlying motivation or reward structure at play. Could you try setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day, and rewarding yourself when you meet them?

It\'s frustrating when medical explanations don\'t quite fit, and you\'re left trying to manage something that feels behavioral but is still really impactful.\\n\\nSince you suspect it\'s rooted in past depression and a learned behavior, maybe try tackling it like breaking any other habit, but with extra self-compassion.

Consistent sleep/wake times (even on weekends!), a truly dark/quiet/cool room, and a solid wind-down routine. The consistency is key, even if you don\'t feel sleepy.\\n*   **Light Therapy:** Since you mentioned REM sleep issues, maybe look into a sunrise alarm clock or light therapy lamp, especially in the mornings. It can help regulate your circadian rhythm and potentially reduce that \\"sleep drunk\\" feeling.\\n*   **Tiny Wins, Big Rewards:** Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on one small victory each day. Maybe it\'s just getting out of bed within 5 minutes of your alarm. Reward yourself for that *immediately* with something you genuinely enjoy (a specific coffee, a quick walk, etc.). The immediate reward is important to rewire the association.\\n*   **Habit Stacking:** Link getting out of bed to something you *want* to do. \\"After I turn off my alarm, I will immediately [make coffee/stretch/read one page of a book].\\" Make it something appealing and easy.\\n*   **Professional Help (Again?):** It might be worth revisiting therapy, specifically focusing on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), even though you don\'t have insomnia in the traditional sense. The techniques for managing sleep-related thoughts and behaviors might still be helpful.\\n*   **Accountability:** Find someone to check in with you daily. Just a simple text message exchange: \\"Did you get up on time?\\" \\"Yes/No.\\" Knowing someone is expecting you to be up might add that extra bit of motivation.\\n\\nThe biggest thing is to be patient with yourself.

Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you\'re talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you\'re listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental.

(why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from?

This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\\n\\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling.

When you notice strong emotions arising, pause and literally name what you\'re feeling: \\"This is anger\\" or \\"I\'m feeling hopeful right now.\\" This small act creates a bit of distance and helps engage your rational mind.\\n\\nFor bigger decisions, try the 24-hour rule. When emotions are running high, commit to waiting 24 hours before making any significant choices. Write down your thoughts and feelings, then revisit them the next day when you\'re calmer.

Think of it like building a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger this skill becomes.\\n\\nAlso consider using a decision journal.

Additionally, trying to reframe your thinking by focusing on the facts of a situation rather than how you feel about it can be beneficial. For example, when faced with a decision, try writing down the pros and cons, or talking through your thoughts with a trusted friend or mentor to get an outside perspective. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and remind yourself of them regularly, so when emotions start to cloud your judgment, you can come back to what you know you want to achieve in the long run. Lastly, consider developing a pre-decision routine that gives you time to reflect on your choices, such as waiting 24 hours before making an important decision, to ensure you\'re acting on logic rather than impulse. Remember, it\'s not about suppressing your emotions entirely, but learning to navigate them in a way that allows you to make decisions that align with your values and goals.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I get where you\'re coming from. It\'s tough when emotions hijack your decision-making. It sounds like you\'re really self-aware, which is the first step.\\n\\nOne thing that\'s helped me is creating a little space between feeling and reacting. When you feel that strong emotion coming on, try to pause. Literally, just stop and take a few deep breaths. It sounds simple, but it can give you a moment to think.\\n\\nThen, try to label the emotion. Instead of just feeling overwhelmed, say to yourself, \\"Okay, I\'m feeling anxious right now,\\" or \\"I\'m feeling really angry.\\" Naming it can help you detach from it a little.\\n\\nAfter that, try writing down the pros and cons of the decision you\'re facing, focusing on the facts and not the feelings. What are the realistic outcomes? What\'s the worst that could happen? Sometimes seeing it on paper can bring clarity.\\n\\nAlso, consider talking to someone you trust \u2013 a friend, family member, or therapist. Just voicing your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see things from a different perspective. You\'re not alone in this, and it\'s definitely something you can work on. Good luck!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_p5ulx3","title":"[Need Advice] Thinking about taking a gap year","body":"I dont think im ready for college. Ive been hardcore struggling with depression for the past couple months, im worried about being able to hold myself accountable for both keeping my grades up and paying bills, I haven\u2019t done some pretty adult things yet like get my license or even have a working phone, etc. I was thinking of taking a gap semester or even year but I\u2019m worried about missing my opportunity or facing these same problems again if i don\u2019t just start now. \\n\\nI think the gap year would let me develop more as a human but im also scared im gonna stay in this state and just keep putting it off. I have passions and hobbies that i want to explore in college but something just doesn\u2019t feel right.","comments":{"best_comment":"I say do it. I took a gap year the summer of 2020 and it was the best thing I could have done for myself last year. I was still in school but the pandemic made me realize that I was not happy with the degree I was pursing. So I left the program and just stopped. I worked the entire time and was figuring myself out. I ended up transferring to a university that I decided about a year later.\\nHaving some sort of plan is the key though so you don\u2019t get too distracted. And give urself a timeline of how long you may need the rest. And there is not wrong with extending that timeline too. A year or even 2, your body and mind are the most important things.\\nAlso remember, THERE IS NO RUSH!! You cannot compare yourself to others because you are on a different path that they are. And there is nothing wrong with that. Your journey is gonna look different from everyone else. I also recommend TheBlissBean, Lavendaire, MucheleB, and RowenaTsai. They are all on YouTube and they make content regarding to school, lifestyle, finding yourself and being more mindful in general. There is also Matt D\u2019Avella, Ali Abdaal, Nathaniel drew, Captain Sinbad, and Thomas Frank. They are on YouTube too and offer a male perspective on mindful lifestyle, productivity, and finding your interests","percentile_10_comment":"I wish I had done a gap year.

I\'m 31 and working on my fourth degree, which is like my 7th serious career change. \\n\\nI\'ve also gotten depression lately and I can tell you trying to do coursework at the same time is HARD. I have been doing minimal semesters and barely passing. \\n\\nI do suggest you get a license and a working phone sooner than later though. Those are hugely helpful when you\'re on your own. \\n\\nSet a hard deadline for the end of the year and be sure to mark when college applications and FAFSA submissions are due and when the semester officially starts. Oh, and some colleges DO allow you to apply a full year ahead. You can always choose not to go. And you don\'t have to pay tuition until the drop date (when the school automatically drops people from the classes for non payment)","gpt_comment":"Taking a gap year can be a great opportunity to focus on personal growth and tackle some of the adulting tasks you mentioned, like getting your license or sorting out your phone situation. It sounds like you\'re aware of the challenges you might face, which is a good start. If you decide to take a gap year, try setting some specific goals for yourself. Maybe aim to achieve one or two key things each month, whether it\'s related to your mental health, personal development, or practical skills. This way, you can build a sense of accomplishment and keep yourself from feeling stuck. Remember, college isn\'t going anywhere, and taking time to prepare yourself can actually make your college experience more rewarding. Just make sure to have a plan and some structure to your time off so you can make the most of it. Good luck!","claude_comment":"Taking a gap year can be a really smart move when you need time to build a stronger foundation. The key is having a concrete plan for that time - otherwise it\'s easy to stay stuck.\\n\\nHere\'s what I\'d suggest: Make a 12-month roadmap with specific goals. Start with the basics like getting your license and phone sorted in the first few months. Then add some part-time work to build financial skills and responsibility. Use the structure of a job to create daily routines and accountability.\\n\\nFor the depression piece, use this time to establish good habits around sleep, exercise, and getting professional help if needed. These fundamentals will serve you well whether you\'re in college or not.\\n\\nThe fear of \\"putting it off forever\\" is valid, but remember - a strategic pause to get yourself ready isn\'t the same as giving up. Set a firm timeline (like \\"I\'m starting fall 2024 no matter what\\") and work backwards from there with monthly milestones.\\n\\nCollege will still be there, and you\'ll likely get way more out of it if you\'re starting from a place of strength rather than struggling to keep your head above water. Just make sure you\'re using this time intentionally to grow and prepare, not just to avoid the challenge.","llama_comment":"Taking a gap year can be a great opportunity for personal growth, and it\'s awesome that you\'re considering what\'s best for your mental health and readiness for college. It might be helpful to make a list of specific goals you\'d like to achieve during your gap year, such as getting your license, setting up a budget, or exploring your passions through internships or volunteering. Having a clear plan can help you stay focused and motivated, and ensure that you\'re using this time to develop the skills and confidence you need to succeed in college. It\'s also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor about your depression, as they can provide you with additional support and guidance during this time. Remember, taking a gap year doesn\'t mean you\'re putting off your future, it means you\'re prioritizing your present and setting yourself up for long-term success.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, and it\'s good you\'re thinking proactively about this. A gap year *could* be really beneficial, but your concerns about it turning into just more procrastination are valid.\\n\\nHere\'s my take: a gap year isn\'t a magic fix. It\'s a *tool*. To use it effectively, you need a plan. Don\'t just drift. If you decide to take the gap year, break down what you want to achieve. You mentioned getting your license and a phone \u2013 those are concrete goals. Make a timeline for them. Maybe license by [Date], phone by [Date].\\n\\nMore importantly, address the depression. Can you find a therapist or counselor to work with during this gap year? That should be priority number one. Think of it as building a foundation *before* you start building the house (college).\\n\\nIf you *do* decide to go to college now, don\'t just ignore these issues. College counseling services are often available, and you can still work on getting your license and a phone. Maybe start with one small, achievable goal each week to build momentum.\\n\\nUltimately, the \\"right\\" choice depends on whether you can create a structured plan for a gap year that addresses your core concerns. If you can, it might be the best thing for you. If you can\'t, going to college and actively seeking support might be a better option. Either way, good luck!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_uu5woe","title":"[Need Advice] I\u2019m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don\u2019t know where to start.","body":"I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I\u2019m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\\\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that\'s caused me to observe the world in a way where it\'s here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don\'t belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","comments":{"best_comment":"PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS\\n\\nHonestly though you\u2019re probably better off than you think if you see the problems.

First off, congrats on the weight loss\u2014that\'s a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you\'re ready to take control of your life, and that\'s a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it\'s setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\\n\\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\\n\\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn\'t take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\\n\\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\\n\\n6. **Seek Support**: Don\'t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\\n\\nRemember, progress takes time, and it\'s okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off, congrats on the 100lb weight loss - that\'s a massive achievement that shows you\'re capable of significant change when you put your mind to it. Don\'t downplay it, even if the method wasn\'t perfect. You\'ve already proven you can transform yourself.\\n\\nThe gaming and escapism make total sense given your background. But now you\'re ready to level up in the real world, and that\'s going to take breaking things down into smaller, manageable quests rather than trying to solve everything at once.\\n\\nStart with creating a basic daily structure. Pick 3-4 fixed times each day for essential activities like waking up, eating meals, and going to bed. Stick to these times religiously for 2-3 weeks until they become automatic. This will help ground you in the present moment and give your days some scaffolding to build on.\\n\\nFor career direction, instead of trying to find your passion immediately, focus on building general workplace skills through any steady job. The goal right now isn\'t finding your dream career - it\'s developing consistency, responsibility, and basic professional capabilities. These transfer to any field you eventually choose.\\n\\nTo improve focus and presence, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes and do just ONE thing during that time. Could be reading, cleaning, job searching, whatever. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back to the task. Start with 20 minutes once per day, then gradually increase. This builds your \\"attention muscle\\" over time.\\n\\nYou\'re not as far behind as you think. Many people reset their lives in their 30s and 40s.

It\'s also great that you\'ve made progress in some areas, like losing 100lbs, which shows you\'re capable of achieving your goals when you set your mind to it.\\n\\nTo start building discipline and structure, I\'d recommend starting small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, focus on creating a daily routine that includes time blocks for self-care, learning, and productivity. You can begin by setting aside 30 minutes each morning for journaling or meditation to help clear your mind and set intentions for the day.\\n\\nSince you mentioned struggling with scatter-brained thoughts and memory recall, consider using a planner or app to stay organized and keep track of your tasks and goals. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks can also help you build momentum and confidence.\\n\\nTo become more present and aware of your surroundings, try incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as taking short walks or doing a few minutes of deep breathing exercises. You can also practice active listening by focusing on the person speaking to you, maintaining eye contact, and asking open-ended questions to encourage meaningful conversations.\\n\\nRemember that personal growth is a journey, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time.

Maybe it\'s waking up at the same time every day, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill on Khan Academy. Just one thing, and build from there. Don\'t try to overhaul your entire life overnight.\\n\\nAbout the memory issues and losing perspective, try journaling. Write down those insights as soon as you have them. Even just a few sentences can help you remember and revisit those ideas later.\\n\\nTo be more present, try mindfulness exercises. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through short meditations. Even just 5 minutes a day can make a difference. When you find your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath or your surroundings.\\n\\nAs for finding a career path, don\'t put so much pressure on yourself to find the \\"perfect\\" thing right away. Experiment! Try volunteering, taking online courses, or shadowing someone in a field you\'re curious about. The goal is to explore and learn, not to find the ultimate answer immediately.\\n\\nYou\'ve got this. It\'s a journey, not a race.

Pick ONE tiny action you can do today - maybe making your bed, drinking a glass of water, or stepping outside for 2 minutes.

Your brain is currently wired to resist change because staying in the comfort zone feels safer.

First, let\'s acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we\'re struggling, so kudos to you for reaching out and seeking help. It\'s clear that you want to make changes, but you\'re not sure where to start. One thing that might be helpful is to focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps towards growth. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you\'d like to see improvement and take a single, tiny action towards it. For example, if you want to start exercising, your first step might be as simple as putting on your workout clothes or doing one push-up. It\'s not about achieving some kind of grand transformation overnight, but about building momentum and developing a sense of control and agency over your life. As for changing your mindset, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge some of the negative self-talk that\'s holding you back. Instead of beating yourself up over your perceived weaknesses, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. Remember that personal growth is a journey, not a destination, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time. You don\'t have to have all the answers right now, just a willingness to show up and take that first step.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I hear you.

Once you\'ve consistently done that one small thing for a week or two, add another. Maybe it\'s going for a 10-minute walk. Again, keep it small and manageable.\\n\\nAs for feeling like a victim, that\'s a tough one. A lot of times, that comes from focusing on what you *can\'t* control. Try shifting your focus to what you *can* control \u2013 your actions, your reactions, your choices in this very moment. Even if it\'s just choosing to get out of bed instead of staying there.\\n\\nFinding your values is a longer process, but you can start by paying attention to what makes you feel angry or inspired. What injustices bother you? What kind of people do you admire? Those clues can point you in the right direction.\\n\\nAnd finally, about fear... everyone\'s afraid of something. The key is to not let fear dictate your life. Start by identifying your biggest fear, then break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.

This could be as simple as journaling, reading something related to your goals, or doing some light planning. The key is to build momentum and make progress feel achievable.\\n\\nIt might also be helpful to explore why you feel so disconnected from your current work - is it the type of work itself, the work environment, or something else? Sometimes, making small changes to our daily routines or finding ways to make our work more meaningful can help us feel more energized and motivated.\\n\\nAs for the nihilism, it\'s possible that feeling unconnected to your goals and values might be contributing to that sense of emptiness. By taking small steps towards your goals and exploring what truly matters to you, you may start to feel more purposeful and directed. Remember, discipline is about progress, not perfection - it\'s okay to take things one step at a time.","gemini_comment":"Okay, so you\'re stuck in the theory trap. You\'ve got the knowledge, but the execution is missing. That\'s super common, don\'t beat yourself up too much.\\n\\nHere\'s the thing: knowing *why* to do something is different from *actually* doing it. You\'re basically fighting your brain\'s reward system. YouTube and Reddit are easy dopamine hits, while your goals require effort and delayed gratification.\\n\\nFirst, tackle the morning. Even Goggins probably snoozes sometimes. Try this: put your phone across the room. Set an alarm for, say, 30 minutes *later* than you usually get up. When it goes off, you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off. Then, immediately do something small and productive. Make your bed, drink a glass of water, do 5 pushups. Anything to break the cycle of staying in bed.\\n\\nSecond, the 3 PM to 11 PM window. That\'s your prime time, and you\'re wasting it. Instead of trying to eliminate YouTube cold turkey (which rarely works), try this: schedule it. Seriously. Tell yourself, \\"Okay, from 3 PM to 3:30 PM, I can watch YouTube.\\" Set a timer. When the timer goes off, you *have* to switch to working on your goals for at least an hour. Then, you can schedule another YouTube break later. It\'s about controlling the habit, not eliminating it entirely.\\n\\nFinally, the nihilism. That\'s a bigger issue, but even if you think nothing matters, *you* still matter. You\'re still experiencing life. So, why not try to make that experience a little better? Focus on small, achievable goals. Celebrate small wins. Maybe the meaning will come later, or maybe it won\'t. But either way, you\'ll be a little less stuck. Good luck!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_12k7iil","title":"[Need Advice]I cant even get myself to work 3 hours a day consistently.","body":"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work.

It sounds like you\'re really trying to find a balance that works for you, and that\'s a great start. First off, don\'t be too hard on yourself.

Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. \\n\\nAlso, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.

Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.\\n\\nLastly, it\'s worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn\'t, it might be why you\'re struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it\'s okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don\'t hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Starting with 3 hours and dropping to 1 isn\'t unusual at all - this happens to most people when building new work habits. The mental resistance you\'re experiencing is totally normal, especially since you mentioned not feeling particularly passionate about the business side of things.\\n\\nHere\'s what I\'d suggest: Start with just 25 minutes of focused work (one Pomodoro), followed by a 5-minute break. Do this twice a day at first. It\'s ridiculously easy, but that\'s the point - you want to build consistency before duration. Once this becomes effortless (probably after a week or two), add another session. Keep building gradually.\\n\\nThe gym analogy you made is really interesting - you\'re motivated there because you get immediate positive feedback. We can use this! Try breaking your work into smaller chunks where you can feel that same sense of completion. Set tiny goals that you can \\"check off\\" every 25 minutes, giving yourself that same hit of accomplishment you get from the gym.\\n\\nAlso, consider examining what type of work actually energizes you versus drains you. If the business itself feels like a constant drain, it might be worth exploring what aspects of work do give you that \\"feel good\\" sensation, even if it\'s just small parts of your current projects.\\n\\nRemember, those people working focused for 6 hours didn\'t start there - they built up to it. There\'s nothing wrong with you; you\'re just at the beginning of building this particular muscle. Start small, be consistent, and gradually level up.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re struggling to find motivation and consistency with your work schedule, and that\'s totally normal. One approach you might consider is indeed starting smaller and gradually increasing your daily work time. Instead of aiming for 3 hours right off the bat, try committing to a manageable 30 minutes or 1 hour of focused work each day, and then gradually add more time as you build the habit. This can help make the task less daunting and allow you to develop a sense of momentum.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth exploring why you feel so differently about work compared to other activities like going to the gym or eating healthy. You mention that with those activities, you can see the benefits immediately and feel good afterwards. With work, it might be helpful to try to identify some more immediate rewards or benefits, even if they\'re not directly related to making money. For example, do you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing a task? Do you enjoy the process of learning new skills or solving problems?\\n\\nAs for whether you care enough about your business, that\'s a tough question to answer, but it might be worth reflecting on what specifically is driving your lack of motivation. Is it the type of work itself, or is it something else entirely? Are there ways you could make your work more engaging or meaningful to you? Remember that it\'s okay if your motivations and interests evolve over time, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it\'s totally normal to struggle with consistency, especially when you\'re first starting out. Don\'t beat yourself up about it!\\n\\nIt sounds like you\'re experiencing burnout, which is common when you push too hard too fast. Lowering your work hours and gradually increasing them is a solid strategy. Think of it like building a muscle \u2013 you wouldn\'t start with the heaviest weight.

Work often lacks that instant gratification. Try breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable tasks with clear, achievable goals. Completing those smaller tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum.\\n\\nFinally, it\'s worth exploring *why* you\'re working on this business. If you don\'t care about the outcome, it\'s going to be a constant uphill battle. Can you connect your work to something you *do* care about, even if it\'s indirectly?

You\'ve already taken the first step by recognizing the problem and asking for help. You\'ve got this.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re caught in a pretty common cycle. One strategy that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and then commit to working on just one of those chunks for a short period of time - say 25 minutes. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and more achievable. After your 25 minutes are up, take a 5-minute break to do something you enjoy, like scrolling Reddit or watching a funny video. Then, come back to your task and repeat the process. This is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can be a really effective way to build focus and momentum. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you\'re procrastinating - are you feeling overwhelmed, bored, or anxious about your schoolwork? Once you understand what\'s driving your procrastination, you can start to develop strategies to address those underlying issues. And don\'t be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track. You\'ve already taken a big step by recognizing your procrastination habit and seeking help, so that\'s something to be proud of!","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get it. Procrastination in high school is super common. It sounds like you\'re already aware of the problem, which is the first step! Alarms can be tough because it\'s easy to just snooze them.\\n\\nInstead of focusing on huge blocks of work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Basically, you work in focused 25-minute intervals with short 5-minute breaks in between. After four \\"pomodoros,\\" you take a longer break (like 20-30 minutes). There are tons of free apps and websites that can help you time it. The short bursts of work can feel less overwhelming and make it easier to get started.\\n\\nAlso, try to identify *why* you\'re procrastinating. Is the work boring? Too hard? If it\'s boring, can you make it more interesting somehow (e.g., listen to music while you work, study with a friend)? If it\'s too hard, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Don\'t aim for perfection right away, just aim to get *something* done. Even 5 minutes of progress is better than nothing!

A banana with coffee and then something else later on. Now, I am onto meal prepping parts of the dishes as I do complete meals with salad + entree. They make me excited to sit down and eat mindfully. So, I make it easy to put together dinner. I have 5-6 options for bfast and I keep them all very simple. I do still sometimes skip lunches and wish if a tablet could replace food.

Start by identifying your triggers for emotional eating. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know what sets it off, you can work on finding healthier coping mechanisms, like going for a walk, journaling, or talking to a friend. Planning your meals can also help. Try to include a variety of foods that you enjoy and that nourish your body. This can make you feel more in control and less likely to reach for comfort foods impulsively. Remember, it\'s okay to have treats now and then\u2014balance is key. Lastly, be kind to yourself. Building a healthy relationship with food takes time, and it\'s normal to have setbacks.

Instead, write down what you eat and how you feel before, during, and after. This helps identify your emotional eating triggers and patterns.\\n\\nOnce you spot those patterns, work on building new responses to those triggers. When you feel the urge to emotional eat, try taking a 10-minute walk, doing some quick stretches, or calling a friend. The key is having specific alternatives ready to go.\\n\\nFor the physical side, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting. Stock up on easy-to-grab healthy snacks you actually enjoy. Make sure you\'re eating regular meals - hunger makes emotional eating much harder to resist. Start small by adding one piece of fruit or veggie to each meal.\\n\\nThe guilt cycle you mentioned can make things worse. Remember that changing your relationship with food is a gradual process. If you have a moment of emotional eating, acknowledge it without judgment and move forward with your next meal.

Once you\'re aware of these triggers, you can begin to find alternative coping mechanisms, such as going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Additionally, consider seeking help from a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can guide you on developing a balanced eating plan that suits your needs and preferences. It might also be helpful to start keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and emotions, which can provide valuable insights into your relationship with food.

No matter how hard I tried, it actually seemed to set my parents off faster. But its good you see it and want to change it, that\'s huge. So congrats on that part. In my adult life I refuse to argue with people, and by extension be yelled at or yell back and forth. If it\'s something that needs to be talked about, it will be talked about after both parties take a breather and are at the point of actually talking to each other. Until then, the subject needs to be left alone. If it\'s something that can be left as \\"agree to disagree\\" then sometimes that is best. It wasn\'t an easy learning process, but I\'ve learned you\'ll say things while angry that you don\'t necessarily mean and then that festers until it gets brought up. Normally out of nowhere. Learning to deal with your emotions so They don\'t control you in certain situations would help. That would differ from person to person though. But thats what helped me, and ultimately helped with me choosing not to argue with people. What others still continue to try and do is nothing I can control, remember that.","percentile_10_comment":"I came to live with my husband over 12 years ago. We were still bf and gf back then. I came from a yelling-everything family and I brought the yelling in this household too. It wasn\'t always arguing, but simply different views. \\n\\nI am maybe lucky to have the partner I do, that kept calm and never yelled back. Took me years to unlearn the yelling after over 20 years of it being something normal. These last 2 years I can\'t remember yelling once, but I might remember smth before these 2 years. \\n\\nIt is an urge deep inside, but it comes easy with practicing few steps, especially when you are the one engaging someone else in conversation:\\n\\n1. Think of what you need to say and if it is actually important saying. Sometimes we act out of impulse, giving 0 thoughts to how this might carry on. \\n\\n2. Do you really need a feedback on something or you already know what\'s to be expected from the other person? In the intimacy of a family, you already know, from past emcounters what the other person wants or needs or what view has. Some questions make others wander if you are actually listening to them and it gets frustrating to know you pay no attention and, coming back to them with a similar situation or question, may fuel some negative feeling. This is why thinking on past situations might help. \\n\\n3. Know, before engaging with anyone in a conversation, that voices might be raised. Allow yourself to calm down first (because knowing what will come will give you a start-up of your own \\"bubbling\\" even before you say the first word). It is important to forgive the other person even before they yell at you. It is even best when you go into a conversation with this positive attitude and no one is yelling. For me, this was amazing. Now I rarely feel joy about it :) ...well, because no one is yelling anymore these days haha!\\n\\n4. Confirmation. This is important for a person that yells. Going into a conversation with this type of people (and I know, because I was one too) is to approve what they say if you indeed approve with them. This should be the only way to talk back to them before getting a chance to speek as well. Let them speak/yell what they need to \\"let out\\" and till they are finished, just tell them \\" I agree with that view too\\" (or something similar, depending what it is said), or even nodding helps, while they talk. This will defuse the state of mind they are in. When it is your turn to speak, start with letting them know you agree with what they said (it is even better if you actually say, word by word, what are you agreeing with), and then approach a different view ifbit is the case(smth like a question: \\"what do you think if this happens\\", \\" I hear you and I think I need an advice if smth goes different, what should I do?\\"). But!!! Sometimes is ok if you let a period of time to cool and come back to them and just telling them you thought of what they said and then start with agreeing with their view/perspective. Afterwords bringing up other things you need to follow up with. Giving them the feeling they are important in any matter of your life is something they find peaceful and they will be in a different set of mind. \\n\\nIn time, yelling family members will learn that they can talk to you in a different manner. They will come to you too and  the same \\"lay-back\\" situation you can apply. Even if they start yelling first and you don\'t have that thinking time ahead, you can just agree, trying to pay attention to the message itself and not letting your voice to get too high. You can actually ask them to let you think of what they ask you or tell you and reassure them that you will give your feedback. \\n\\nFor you, dear OP, it will be easier to change than for them. They did not thought of change as you did. Asking them now to stop yelling is an insult and I\'m sure you don\'t want them feel like this. They will see, little by little that you\'ll yell less and less and that you listen more and maybe, one day, they will change too. \\n\\nI can report now that my relationship with my family is yelling-free. They yell at each other sometimes, but in relationship with me, because I sticked with my plan, they stopped.

The way you described things I do too think that they love you and not everything that they yell is meant to harm you (actually nothing is).

One thing that might help is to practice pausing before responding. When someone starts yelling, take a deep breath and count to five in your head. This can give you a moment to decide how you want to respond rather than just reacting. It might also help to have a phrase ready, like \\"I want to talk about this, but not while we\'re yelling,\\" and then step away if you need to. Over time, this can help you build the discipline to stay calm even when others aren\'t. It might not change your family\'s behavior right away, but it can help you feel more in control and less reactive. Also, consider talking to your family about how the yelling affects you when things are calm. They might not realize the impact it has. Keep at it, and remember that change takes time.","claude_comment":"Breaking the yelling cycle is really challenging, especially when it\'s been the normal way of communicating for so long. The key is to recognize that you can only control your own responses, not anyone else\'s.\\n\\nOne effective technique is to practice the \\"grey rock\\" method when others start yelling. This means becoming as unreactive and uninteresting as possible - keeping your voice steady and calm, using short responses, and avoiding getting pulled into the emotional escalation. It takes practice, but it works because yelling usually feeds off the other person\'s reaction.\\n\\nWhen you feel yourself getting triggered, try taking a deep breath and counting to 5 before responding. If you need to, it\'s perfectly okay to say \\"I need a minute\\" and step away until you can respond calmly. This isn\'t running away - it\'s giving yourself space to break the pattern.\\n\\nFor the long term, consider learning some basic meditation or mindfulness techniques. These can help you stay centered when tensions rise. Start small, even 5 minutes a day of practicing calm can make a difference in how you handle heated moments.\\n\\nRemember that changing this pattern won\'t happen overnight. There will be times you slip up and yell back - that\'s normal. What matters is recognizing it, resetting, and trying again next time. Each calm response is building a new habit, even if it doesn\'t feel like it in the moment.\\n\\nThe fact that you\'re aware of this pattern and wanting to change it is already a huge step forward. Keep working at it, and don\'t be too hard on yourself when it\'s difficult.","llama_comment":"It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the pattern of behavior in your household and wanting to make a change. One thing to consider is that you can\'t control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. When someone yells at you, it\'s natural to want to yell back, but taking a step back and not engaging can be really powerful. Instead of ignoring them entirely, you could try taking a deep breath, counting to 10, or even just saying \\"I\'m not going to discuss this when we\'re both upset, let\'s talk about it later.\\" This can help de-escalate the situation and give you time to collect your thoughts before responding. It might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your family members about how their yelling affects you, and see if you can all work together to find more constructive ways of communicating. Remember that changing your response to yelling doesn\'t mean you\'re being weak or passive, it means you\'re taking control of your own emotions and reactions. It\'s not going to be easy, but with practice and patience, you can develop new habits and learn to respond in a way that feels more positive and respectful to yourself and others.","gemini_comment":"Hey, that sounds like a tough situation, and it\'s great you\'re recognizing the pattern and wanting to change it. It\'s definitely possible to break free from that cycle, even if it feels ingrained.\\n\\nFirst, you\'re right, ignoring them *might* be a strategy, but it\'s hard to do in the heat of the moment. Think of it like this: you\'re trying to rewire your brain\'s reaction. It\'s going to take practice and you\'ll slip up, and that\'s okay. Don\'t beat yourself up when you do yell back, just acknowledge it and try again next time.\\n\\nA few things you could try:\\n\\n*   **Pre-plan your response:** When you\'re calm, think about a few phrases you can use when someone starts yelling. Something neutral like \\"I hear you\'re upset\\" or \\"I need a minute to process this\\" can buy you time and disrupt the usual yelling match. The goal is to not engage with the content of the yelling, but acknowledge the emotion.\\n*   **Remove yourself:** If possible, physically leave the situation. Say something like, \\"I\'m getting too heated, I need to step away for a bit.\\" Go to another room, go for a walk, anything to break the cycle. This is a really powerful tool.\\n*   **Focus on your breathing:** When you feel yourself getting triggered, consciously slow down your breathing. Deep breaths can help calm your nervous system and make it easier to think rationally.\\n*   **Lower your voice:** This might sound counterintuitive when someone is yelling, but try lowering your voice and speaking calmly. It can be disarming and force the other person to adjust their volume too.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth considering that your dad might not even realize how his yelling impacts you. Maybe, at a calm moment (definitely not during an argument!), you could try talking to him about how it makes you feel. Frame it as \\"I\'m trying to communicate better, and I\'d appreciate it if we could both work on not yelling.\\"\\n\\nThis won\'t be an overnight fix, but with consistent effort, you can definitely change your reactions and hopefully influence the dynamic in your family. Good luck!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_11gpe6g","title":"[Need Advice] How do I train my brain to think critically?","body":"I\'ll be honest I went into a long depression after high school and didn\'t really use my brain.

Once you\'ve completed your focused work session, you can then take a short break to relax and recharge - but try to do it in a different location, like a couch or outdoor area, to associate bed with sleep only. Additionally, make your bed a sleep-only zone by removing any screens or work materials from it, so your brain starts to see it as a place for rest, not leisure or productivity.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get that feeling \u2013 the bed just *calls* to you sometimes! It sounds like your bed has become a trigger for relaxation (and procrastination) instead of just sleep. Here\'s a few things that might help:\\n\\nFirst, try to create a clear separation between your workspace and your relaxation space. If possible, don\'t do *any* work in your bed. That means no laptop, no books, nothing. Your bed should be only for sleep and maybe reading for pleasure.\\n\\nSecond, when you get home, immediately change your clothes. Don\'t stay in comfy clothes that make you want to relax. Changing into something that signals \\"work time\\" can help shift your mindset.\\n\\nThird, break your work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of aiming for hours of work, try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break *away* from your bed. Get up, stretch, grab a drink, then get back to it. This can make the task seem less daunting and prevent that \\"I need a rest\\" feeling from hitting so hard.\\n\\nFinally, be honest with yourself about the \\"work while laying down\\" thing. It\'s clearly not working for you. Acknowledge that, and actively resist the urge. When that thought pops up, immediately get up and go back to your desk. It\'s about retraining your brain. Good luck, you got this!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_y0vssv","title":"[need advice] how do I force myself to get up early?","body":"I\u2019ve tried everything.

First, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, to regulate your body\'s internal clock. Gradually adjust your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal. Also, consider placing your alarm across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. This can help break the cycle of hitting snooze. Lastly, make your mornings something to look forward to by planning a small reward or enjoyable activity right after you wake up. Consistency is key, so keep at it, and you\'ll likely see progress over time!","claude_comment":"Getting up early is tough, but it\'s definitely something you can master with the right approach. The key is to make it easier for your morning self to succeed rather than relying on willpower alone.\\n\\nFirst, work backwards from your wake time to set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep. Your body clock needs regularity to adapt. Even on weekends, try not to deviate by more than an hour.\\n\\nPut your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. The moment your feet hit the floor, immediately walk to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face. This combination of movement and sensation helps shake off the grogginess.\\n\\nWhat helped me was having a specific reason to get up early - something more compelling than just \\"I should.\\" Maybe it\'s hitting the gym when it\'s empty, enjoying a peaceful breakfast, or getting a head start on work. Whatever motivates you.\\n\\nAlso, make your bedroom a wake-up friendly environment. Get a sunrise alarm clock or put your lights on a timer. The gradual increase in light helps your body transition naturally from sleep. Keep the room slightly cool too - it\'s harder to get up when you\'re cozy and warm.\\n\\nRemember that the first week will be the hardest. Push through those initial days and it gets significantly easier as your body adjusts to the new schedule. You\'ve already shown you can build discipline in other areas - this is just another skill to master.","llama_comment":"One strategy that might help is to start small and set a ridiculously achievable goal, like getting out of bed 15 minutes earlier each day. This can help build momentum and make the task less daunting. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you\'re struggling to get up early - is it because you\'re not getting enough sleep, or is it because you don\'t have a compelling reason to get out of bed? Once you understand the root cause, you can develop a plan to address it. For example, if you\'re not a morning person, try setting a goal that\'s rewarding to you, like enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or doing some stretching exercises. It\'s also important to create an environment that supports your goals, such as placing your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Remember, developing self-discipline is a process and it\'s okay to take it one step at a time - don\'t be too hard on yourself if you don\'t see immediate results.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I get the early morning struggle. It\'s a tough one! Since you\'ve been successful with discipline in other areas, let\'s try to apply some of that here.\\n\\nFirst, make sure your bedtime is realistic. If you\'re trying to jump from 6 hours of sleep to 8 and wake up super early, your body will fight you. Gradual adjustments are key.\\n\\nSecond, what\'s the *very first* thing you need to do when you get up? Don\'t think about the whole day, just that first action. Maybe it\'s drinking a glass of water you left by your bed, or putting on your workout clothes. Make it something small and easy to accomplish.\\n\\nThird, consider the alarm itself. Is it too easy to snooze? Experiment with different sounds, or even better, put your alarm across the room so you *have* to get out of bed to turn it off.\\n\\nFinally, and this is important: reward yourself! What\'s a small, enjoyable thing you can do *immediately* after getting up that you look forward to? Coffee? A few minutes of reading?

There\'s no unnecessarily complicated calorie counting, or reading food labels, or whatever fad-diet rules. You simply buy fresh veggies, fruits, nuts, etc. cook it, eat it. \\n\\nAs a side effect, you\'ll save money, spend it to learn other skills, or even invest them.

It\'s awesome that you\'re taking steps to clean up your diet and build better habits. Here are a few tips that might help:\\n\\n1. **Gradual Changes**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try reducing your intake gradually. This can make the transition easier and more sustainable.\\n\\n2. **Healthy Swaps**: Since you\'re plant-based, there are tons of delicious alternatives to junk food. Try swapping your protein cookie for a homemade energy ball or a piece of fruit with nut butter. For chips, roasted chickpeas or kale chips can be a crunchy alternative.\\n\\n3. **Meal Prep**: Learning to cook is a great skill, and meal prepping can save you time and help you avoid reaching for junk food. Start with simple recipes and gradually build your skills.\\n\\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to when and why you reach for junk food. Sometimes it\'s out of habit or boredom. Being mindful can help you make more conscious choices.\\n\\n5. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes cravings can be confused with thirst. Make sure you\'re drinking enough water throughout the day.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s all about progress, not perfection. You\'re already on the right track by exercising and making these changes. Keep it up, and good luck!","claude_comment":"Great job recognizing this habit and wanting to make a change! Since you\'re already exercising regularly, cleaning up your diet is a natural next step. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, which rarely works with sugar, try gradually replacing your current snacks with healthier alternatives. For example, when you\'re craving something sweet, reach for dates, berries, or a banana with nut butter. These will satisfy your sweet tooth while providing actual nutrients.\\n\\nSince you\'re plant-based, you might want to try making your own protein snacks. There are tons of recipes online for homemade protein balls using dates, nuts, and plant protein powder. They can be just as satisfying as those store-bought cookies but without all the processed ingredients.\\n\\nThe key is to make small, sustainable changes. Maybe start by replacing just one processed snack per day with a whole food alternative. Once that feels normal, tackle another. Keep healthy snacks readily available and visible - it\'s much easier to make good choices when they\'re right in front of you.\\n\\nAlso, drinking more water throughout the day can help reduce cravings. Sometimes what we interpret as a sugar craving is actually thirst. Keep a water bottle with you and stay hydrated.\\n\\nRemember that slip-ups are normal when changing any habit. Don\'t beat yourself up if you have a day where you eat more junk food than planned - just get back on track the next day. You\'ve already shown great discipline with your exercise routine, and you can absolutely apply that same dedication to improving your diet.","llama_comment":"It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the need to cut back on high sugar and processed foods, especially given your regular exercise routine. Since you\'re plant-based, exploring healthy alternatives like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits can be a good starting point to curb your junk food cravings. Considering you\'ve just started learning how to cook for yourself, try simple recipes that incorporate these ingredients. For instance, you could make your own energy balls using oats, nuts, and dried fruits as a healthier substitute for store-bought protein cookies. Also, having a bowl of fruit at home can be a great reminder to reach for something natural when you feel like snacking. Remember, it\'s all about progress, not perfection - start by replacing one unhealthy snack with a healthier option each day and see how that goes. Keep in mind that developing self-discipline is a process, and it sounds like you\'re on the right track by acknowledging its importance and taking small steps towards cooking more for yourself. Good luck on your journey to cleaner eating!","gemini_comment":"Hey! It\'s awesome you\'re tackling this at 16 \u2013 that\'s seriously proactive.

Maybe replace the cookie with a piece of fruit and a handful of nuts. For the chips, try making your own baked sweet potato chips or air-popped popcorn. Small changes add up!\\n\\nSince you\'re already exercising, that\'s a huge plus. Maybe try to link your workouts to your food goals.

The good news is that recognizing you need to build discipline is already a huge first step.\\n\\nStart small. Pick one consistent wake-up time and stick to it every day, even weekends. This will help regulate your daily rhythm and make other habits easier to build. Set an alarm and put it across the room so you have to get up.\\n\\nCreate a basic daily schedule that includes dedicated study blocks.

To start building discipline, I\'d recommend setting clear, achievable goals for what you want to accomplish during this gap year - not just academically, but also personally. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks and create a schedule to help you stay on track. It might also be helpful to establish a daily routine that includes time blocks for studying, self-care, and activities that bring you joy. Consider finding an accountability partner or mentor who can support and motivate you along the way. Additionally, you could try using the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work + 5 minutes of break - to help you stay focused and avoid burnout.

Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes and commit to working on the task for that short period. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you\'re in motion, it becomes easier to keep going. Also, consider the \\"2-minute rule\\" where if something takes less than 2 minutes to do, just do it immediately. This can help train your brain to act quickly and reduce the mental resistance. Lastly, remind yourself of the benefits of getting things done early, like reduced stress and more free time later. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset. Good luck!","claude_comment":"Your brain is actually doing what brains are designed to do - avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. But here\'s the thing: that immediate comfort comes at the cost of much bigger discomfort later (stress, rushed work, missed opportunities).\\n\\nTry reframing it this way: doing things immediately IS the comfortable choice. When you tackle something right away, you get to enjoy the rest of your time truly stress-free, knowing it\'s handled. That peace of mind is worth way more than the brief comfort of delay.\\n\\nStart small. Next time you have a task, try the \\"just 2 minutes\\" approach. Tell yourself you\'ll work on it for just 2 minutes. Usually, once you start, you\'ll find it\'s not nearly as uncomfortable as your brain predicted, and you\'ll want to keep going. Even if you don\'t, that\'s 2 minutes of progress you didn\'t have before.\\n\\nThe motivation you\'re waiting for? It usually comes AFTER you start, not before. Action creates motivation, not the other way around. Each time you push through and do something immediately, you\'re training your brain to recognize that the discomfort is temporary but the rewards are lasting.\\n\\nRemember: Future You is still You. By doing things now, you\'re basically giving a gift to yourself - the gift of not having to deal with it later when it\'s more urgent and stressful.","llama_comment":"I think what you\'re describing is a pretty common struggle - our brains are wired to avoid discomfort, and procrastination can be a major obstacle. One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around the idea that it\'s not about feeling motivated, but about building discipline. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try telling yourself that you\'re going to take action for a set amount of time, say 25 minutes, and then you can take a break. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, you might want to consider identifying the underlying reasons why you\'re procrastinating - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what\'s driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to address those specific issues. Lastly, remind yourself that the feeling of discomfort is usually temporary, and the sense of accomplishment you\'ll get from taking action will often outweigh the initial struggle.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get that feeling. It\'s like your brain is wired to seek comfort first, and anything that feels like a struggle gets pushed aside.\\n\\nOne thing that\'s helped me is to reframe \\"doing things immediately\\" as not a huge, overwhelming task, but as a series of tiny, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, if you need to do laundry, don\'t think \\"I need to do all the laundry.\\" Think \\"I need to gather the dirty clothes from the floor.\\" That\'s it. Once you\'ve done that, the next step (starting the washing machine) feels a lot less daunting.\\n\\nAlso, try to focus on the *relief* you\'ll feel once the task is done, not the discomfort of starting. Visualize that feeling of accomplishment and freedom from having it hanging over your head. It\'s a much more powerful motivator than trying to argue with the \\"comfort now\\" part of your brain.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It\'s okay to procrastinate sometimes. The key is to not let it become a habit. When you catch yourself doing it, acknowledge it, and then try one of these strategies to get moving.

Start by exploring your interests in design and working with animals in small ways. You could volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends or take some free online design courses (like on Coursera or YouTube) to test the waters without a huge commitment.\\n\\nAbout school - yes, many people work full-time while studying.

Even if it feels ridiculously easy, those small wins can help you break out of the zero discipline cycle.\\n\\nAlso, think about *why* you lost your discipline. Did you burn out? Get frustrated? Identifying the trigger can help you avoid it in the future. Maybe you were practicing too much, or maybe you weren\'t enjoying the songs you were learning. Adjust your approach to make it more sustainable and fun.

The second I hear any kind of criticism from a parent, professor, friend, or acquaintance, I feel incredibly deflated and my entire day is ruined.

Any advice on developing a more resilient attitude to criticism?","comments":{"best_comment":"You need to grow your self confidence.\\n\\nIn my case. I studied some philosophy.\\n\\nAlso, you need to be smart to take this criticism like a good sign.

Cuz are ppl out there that doesn\'t have a little of confidence to achieve that you are achieving. Or actually envy your actual position or anything that you are doing. \\n\\nYou need to be able to identify which critics actually are good for you. Be humble, and accept the critics that can be an improvement for you. Be smart, think about this critics like only information that comes to you. You decide to use it in the way you need. Don\'t waste good information but if the info comes with hate or trash words, just don\'t waste your time arguing or being mad, don\'t auto sabotage your mind.\\n\\nIn all of the cases that I mentioned critics are so good because if ppl are talking shit or want to demotivate you. It is sign that you are doing things ok. If they are good, the critics are constructive cuz they want you to be better. But in the other hand if they are bad, the critics are trash cuz they envy you and don\'t want you to success. \\n\\nBut always listen, and take advantage of information.\\n\\nMost of ppl actually don\'t want others to grow and have success in life cuz in that way they feel less bad.\\n\\nKeep going.","percentile_10_comment":"Write down all the things you think are worth criticizing. Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much everything. Don\u2019t take yourself so seriously.","gpt_comment":"One way to develop a thicker skin is to reframe how you view criticism. Instead of seeing it as a personal attack, try to see it as an opportunity for growth. When someone criticizes you, ask yourself if there\'s any truth to what they\'re saying and how you can use it to improve. It might help to remind yourself that everyone has room for improvement and that criticism is a part of learning and growing. Also, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of being human. Over time, this mindset shift can help you become more resilient to criticism. Lastly, consider setting small goals to expose yourself to constructive feedback regularly, like asking a trusted friend for their honest opinion on something specific. This can help you gradually build up your tolerance and learn to handle criticism more effectively.","claude_comment":"Learning to handle criticism better is a skill that can definitely be developed with practice. One effective approach is to start viewing criticism as valuable feedback for growth rather than a personal attack. When someone offers criticism, try to pause and ask yourself \\"What can I learn from this?\\" instead of immediately feeling defensive.\\n\\nA practical exercise you can try: The next time you receive criticism, write it down word-for-word and wait 24 hours before reflecting on it. This cooling-off period helps separate the emotional reaction from the actual content of the feedback. You\'ll often find that what felt devastating in the moment looks much more manageable the next day.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth remembering that receiving criticism usually means you\'re putting yourself out there and trying things - that\'s something to be proud of. Even the most successful people face regular criticism. The difference is they\'ve learned to filter it: take what\'s useful, discard what isn\'t, and keep moving forward.\\n\\nStart small. Maybe practice with minor critiques from people you trust, and gradually work your way up to handling tougher feedback. Over time, you\'ll build that mental muscle of resilience, just like any other skill.\\n\\nRemember: someone taking the time to give you feedback often means they see potential in you and want to help you improve. That\'s actually a compliment in disguise.","llama_comment":"Developing thicker skin to criticism is definitely achievable with practice and the right mindset. One strategy you could try is to separate your self-worth from the criticism itself - remember that just because someone criticizes one aspect of your work or behavior, it doesn\'t define your entire worth as a person. It might also help to reframe criticism as an opportunity for growth and improvement, rather than as a personal attack. When you receive criticism, try to focus on the specific issue being addressed and what you can learn from it, rather than taking it as a reflection of your overall character. Additionally, consider seeking out constructive feedback from people you trust, which can help you build resilience and develop a more nuanced understanding of how to use criticism to your advantage. It\'s also important to remind yourself that it\'s okay to make mistakes and that everyone receives criticism at some point - it\'s how you respond to it that matters. By gradually exposing yourself to constructive criticism and working on your self-perception, you can build up your resilience over time and develop a more confident attitude towards feedback.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get where you\'re coming from. Criticism stings! One thing that\'s helped me is to try and reframe how I see it. Instead of viewing criticism as a personal attack, try to see it as data. Is there something useful in what they\'re saying, even if the delivery isn\'t perfect?\\n\\nAnother thing is to actively seek feedback in small doses. Ask a friend or professor for specific feedback on a project or presentation. This helps you get used to hearing critiques and allows you to practice responding constructively.\\n\\nAlso, remember that not all criticism is valid. Sometimes people are projecting their own insecurities or just having a bad day. Learn to discern between constructive criticism and just plain negativity. If it\'s not helpful or accurate, let it roll off your back. It takes practice, but you can definitely build up that resilience!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_v37kpt","title":"[Need Advice] How to resist the urge to eat?","body":"I read the post about masturbation and it kind of put me in front of my problem: eating.

It sounds like you\'re trying to get a handle on your eating habits, which is a great step. Here are a few ideas that might help:\\n\\n1. **Identify Triggers**: Since you mentioned eating out of boredom, try to pinpoint when these moments happen. Is it during a specific time of day or after certain activities? Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternative activities to distract yourself, like going for a walk, reading, or picking up a hobby.\\n\\n2. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to your food, savoring each bite, and eating slowly. It can help you feel more satisfied with less food.\\n\\n3. **Healthy Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks on hand for when cravings hit. Things like fruits, veggies, or nuts can be satisfying without adding too many calories.\\n\\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you\'re drinking enough water throughout the day.\\n\\n5. **Meal Planning**: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive eating. Knowing what and when you\'ll eat can help you stick to your calorie goals.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s about progress, not perfection. Small changes can lead to big results over time. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Eating out of boredom is super common, but there are several practical ways to get a handle on it. First, try to make eating more intentional - sit down at a table without distractions and focus on your food rather than mindlessly snacking. This helps you feel more satisfied with proper meals.\\n\\nFor managing cravings and leftovers specifically, portion control starts in the kitchen. Store leftovers in individual containers with proper portion sizes right after cooking. Put them toward the back of the fridge and keep cut vegetables or other low-cal snacks front and center for when you want to munch.\\n\\nThe boredom aspect is key here - you\'ll want to build a \\"menu\\" of alternative activities to do instead of eating. Keep your hands busy with a hobby like drawing or crafts, go for a walk, call a friend, or tackle a small task you\'ve been putting off. The urge to eat often passes after 10-15 minutes of doing something else.\\n\\nDrinking water or herbal tea can also help curb false hunger. Try keeping a large water bottle with you and setting specific meal/snack times. This creates structure and makes it easier to stick to your calorie goals.\\n\\nRemember that building new habits takes time. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself as you develop a healthier relationship with food. You\'ve already taken a great first step by recognizing the pattern and seeking solutions.","llama_comment":"Resisting the urge to eat, especially when it\'s driven by boredom, can be tough. One strategy that might help is to find alternative activities to do when you feel the urge to snack. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing a few jumping jacks, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Sometimes, our brains can mistake boredom for hunger, so giving yourself something else to focus on can help curb unnecessary eating. \\n\\nAnother approach is to plan out your meals and snacks in advance, including healthy options that fit within your calorie goals. This can help reduce the temptation of leftovers or other high-calorie foods. You might also consider removing or limiting triggers - like keeping leftovers out of sight or finding healthier ways to cope with boredom, such as reading, drawing, or calling a friend.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth exploring why you\'re eating out of boredom. Is there something missing that food is filling? Addressing the underlying issue can make it easier to develop healthier habits. Lastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it\'s about progress, not perfection. Small steps, like reducing your daily calorie intake gradually or finding one new activity to replace eating out of boredom, can add up over time.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I get it, food cravings can be tough! It sounds like you\'ve already identified boredom as a trigger, which is a great first step.\\n\\nA few things that might help:\\n\\n*   **Hydration is key:** Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger.

Maybe portion them out immediately after a meal into single-serving containers and freeze them, or give some away.

Pre-tracking your food in an app can also make you more aware of what you\'re consuming.\\n*   **Don\'t beat yourself up:** If you slip up, don\'t throw in the towel.

The way you\'re feeling right now is rough, but it\'s not permanent and it\'s not beyond repair. Let\'s break this down into manageable pieces.\\n\\nFirst, having ADHD means your brain works differently - not worse, just different. Many successful people have ADHD and have found ways to work with it rather than against it. Instead of trying to force yourself to be good at multitasking, lean into your ability to hyperfocus. Find roles that let you tackle one thing at a time.\\n\\nStart small. Really small. Pick one tiny skill you\'d like to improve and practice it for just 5 minutes a day.

The goal isn\'t to become an expert - it\'s just to prove to yourself that you can grow.\\n\\nFor job hunting, try looking for positions that play to your strengths rather than forcing yourself into roles that drain you. Introverts can excel in many careers - data analysis, writing, programming, research, skilled trades - where the focus is on your work rather than constant social interaction. \\n\\nStop comparing yourself to others - they\'re running a different race with different starting points. Instead, compare yourself to where you were yesterday. Even tiny improvements count.\\n\\nThe fact that you feel better when you\'re confident shows that your personality isn\'t the problem - your self-talk is. Work on building small wins that you can look back on. Keep a \\"wins journal\\" where you write down one thing you did well each day, no matter how small.\\n\\nYou\'ve already shown courage by reaching out for advice. That\'s a win right there. Build on that momentum, one tiny step at a time.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re really struggling with some tough feelings about yourself, and it\'s making it hard for you to see a path forward in your career. One thing that might be helpful is to try to separate your self-worth from your job prospects. Instead of thinking \\"I\'m not good enough to do this job,\\" try to focus on what specific skills or tasks you\'re interested in and see if there are any jobs that align with those. You don\'t have to be the most outgoing or charismatic person to succeed - many jobs value quiet, detail-oriented workers, for example. \\n\\nIt might also be helpful to start small and build up your confidence gradually. Instead of looking at big, intimidating jobs like being a trivia host, what are some smaller steps you could take to get more experience and build your skills? Could you try volunteering or taking on a part-time job in a low-stakes environment? This could help you get a feel for what you\'re capable of and start to build up your self-esteem. \\n\\nLastly, it\'s worth remembering that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparing yourself to others is often not very helpful. Instead of focusing on what you think you\'re lacking, try to focus on what you do bring to the table - your unique perspective, skills, and experiences. And don\'t forget that ADHD is a legitimate condition that can affect people\'s lives in many ways - it\'s not something to be ashamed of, and there are many successful people with ADHD who have learned to work with their strengths and challenges.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I hear you.

Think about skills you *want* to develop, not just what you think you\'re already good at (or not good at). Even a part-time gig where you interact with a few people could be a starting point. The goal isn\'t to be perfect, it\'s to get some experience and build confidence.\\n\\nRegarding the self-loathing, that\'s a bigger beast, but discipline can help there too. Start small.

The key is consistency. When you start proving to yourself that you *can* stick to something, even something small, it builds momentum.\\n\\nAlso, comparison is the thief of joy. Seriously. Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger those feelings. Focus on your own progress, not someone else\'s highlight reel.\\n\\nFinally, for the ADHD stuff, have you explored strategies specifically for managing it? There are tons of resources out there, from apps to organizational techniques.

Given that you\'re a morning person and can wake up at 5am without issue, it sounds like the challenge is more about prioritizing your workout over work. One strategy you could try is to set a clear goal for what you want to achieve with your 5am workouts, and then schedule them in your calendar as non-negotiable appointments. This might help you mentally prepare to put your workout first, before diving into work. Additionally, you could try to make your workout routine more enjoyable, whether that\'s finding a workout buddy, listening to music or podcasts, or trying out a new type of exercise. This might help shift your motivation and make it feel less like a chore. Lastly, consider starting small - instead of aiming for a full hour-long workout, start with 20-30 minutes and gradually increase the duration as the habit becomes more established. Good luck!","gemini_comment":"Hey, congrats on the flossing and cold showers, that\'s awesome! It sounds like you\'re already building good momentum.\\n\\nSince you\'re a morning person and the waking up isn\'t the issue, it seems like the pull of work is the biggest hurdle.

Reduce any friction that might make you choose work.\\n\\n2. **Start ridiculously small:** Don\'t aim for a full hour workout right away. Commit to just 15 minutes. Tell yourself you can stop after 15, but often you\'ll keep going. It\'s about building the habit, not crushing a workout every day.\\n\\n3. **Reward yourself (appropriately):** After your workout, have something you enjoy (that isn\'t work!). Maybe a specific coffee or a few minutes of reading. Positive reinforcement can work wonders.\\n\\n4. **Accountability:** Tell someone you\'re doing this, or find a workout buddy. Knowing someone else is expecting you can be a powerful motivator.\\n\\n5. **Reframe \\"work\\":** Is it possible you\'re using work as a form of avoidance?

I wish to stop bad sleeping habit and have a early sleeping habit. I wish to start working out early morning but I haven\u2019t been able to go regularly. I live in a temperate zone it has been harder for me to change because I\u2019m from tropics(maybe it\u2019s a lie I\u2019m telling myself)\\nI also had a history of bad sleeping habits, but now I have improved a bit (most nights I sleep 6.5 hours average) but I want to get better.\\nSuggest me some sleep habits or techniques that helped you.","comments":{"best_comment":"I\'ve finally managed to break my bad sleep habits. Here\'s how:\\n\\n1. Start preparing for bed in advance of your bedtime. For example, if you want to go to bed at 10:30, set an alarm 1 hour to start doing bedtime routines. So at 9:30 you shower, brush teeth, start dimming/turning off lights, get stuff ready for tomorrow, etc.\\n2. Immediately stop using cellphone or computers at this alarm time as well. This period is your bedtime preparation phase and planning for tomorrow phase, nothing else.\\n3. Use settings in your smartphone which make the phone almost unusable at this cutoff time. Android has sleep routines. In this routine you can set it to automatically make the screen black and white and limit app usage. Use this. It\'s powerful. Then charge your phone at night far away from you in an ugly place. I put my phone on the floor at the other end of the room. Never on the nightstand.\\n4. Throughout the day, think ahead about your bedtime routine. Nothing happens spontaneously, including sleep. By thinking throughout the day, you mentally **prepare that your day will definitely end at this 9:30 cutoff and you must complete your tasks before then.**\\n5. Start at an easier bedtime and start pushing it back more and more as the habit gets stronger. Now I could make myself wake up at 5 AM easily daily if I wanted to just by changing when I start my bedtime prep routine.\\n6. Once you get the basics you can start to make the sleep routine enjoyable. Throw in things that are calming but not cellphone or computer related. Drink tea, write goals, write in a journal, etc within that hour.\\n\\nIf you find your mind racing while in bed, get out a pen and paper and write about the thoughts for a few minutes. Studies show writing on the issue to be calming and will silence the mental chatter.","percentile_10_comment":"1. Stop using gadgets in bed\\n2.

This helps regulate your body\'s internal clock.\\n\\n2. **Wind Down Routine**: Create a relaxing pre-sleep routine. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or doing some light stretching. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed as the blue light can interfere with your sleep.\\n\\n3. **Limit Caffeine and Heavy Meals**: Try to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and keep heavy meals a few hours before bedtime.\\n\\n4. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, a cool room temperature, and minimal noise and light.\\n\\n5. **Morning Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure in the morning. This can help reset your circadian rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep at night.\\n\\n6. **Exercise Regularly**: Since you want to work out in the morning, try to stick with it. Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself.

The key is to work backwards from when you want to wake up and create a consistent wind-down routine.\\n\\nSince you want to work out in the morning, pick your ideal wake-up time and count back 7-8 hours - that\'s your target bedtime. The trick is to stick to this time even on weekends to keep your circadian rhythm stable.\\n\\nStart by dimming lights and avoiding screens 1-2 hours before bed (or use blue light filters if you must). Make your bedroom as dark and cool as possible - this helps simulate the temperature drop that naturally triggers sleep. A white noise machine can also help if you\'re used to different ambient sounds from your previous location.\\n\\nThe morning routine is just as important. As soon as your alarm goes off, expose yourself to bright light - open curtains, turn on lights, or step outside. This helps reset your body clock. Even if you don\'t work out right away, getting that light exposure will help tremendously.\\n\\nDon\'t try to change everything at once. Start by shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier every few days until you reach your target time. Your current 6.5 hours is a good foundation to build from.

You might also consider keeping a sleep diary to track your progress and identify any patterns or triggers that affect your sleep.

Since you\'re aiming for early workouts, try to get some sunlight first thing in the morning. It signals to your body that it\'s time to be awake.

An hour before bed, dim the lights, put away screens, and do something relaxing like reading or taking a warm bath. Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.\\n\\nFourth, don\'t beat yourself up if you slip up. Just get back on track the next day.

It sounds like you\'re really trying to make a positive change, and that\'s a great first step.

Good luck!","claude_comment":"Getting your sleep schedule back on track is totally doable, but you\'ll need to tackle this systematically rather than trying to force dramatic changes overnight. Here\'s what works:\\n\\nFirst, start by shifting your schedule gradually. Instead of jumping straight to 6am, move your wake time 30 minutes earlier every few days. If you\'re currently waking at 4pm, aim for 3:30pm for 2-3 days, then 3pm, and so on. This gives your body clock time to adjust.\\n\\nFor the actual wake-up part: As soon as your alarm goes off, immediately get up and go outside for 5-10 minutes. Natural sunlight is crucial for resetting your circadian rhythm. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is way more effective than indoor lighting.\\n\\nTo avoid those multi-hour naps (which are definitely sabotaging your sleep schedule), set a strict rule: no naps after 4pm, and keep them to 20 minutes max. Use an actual timer. When you feel sleepy during the day, try some light exercise, a cold shower, or stepping outside instead.\\n\\nThe key to making this stick is what you do before bed. Create a wind-down routine starting 1-2 hours before sleep: dim the lights, avoid screens (or use blue light filters), and do calm activities like reading or stretching. Your body needs these consistent signals that it\'s time to sleep.\\n\\nMost importantly: be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. A regular wake time is more important than a regular bedtime when you\'re trying to fix your schedule. Your body will eventually start getting naturally tired at the right time.\\n\\nRemember that this process takes time - expect 2-3 weeks before it feels natural. The first week especially will be tough, but pushing through that initial discomfort is worth it for the long-term benefits you\'ve already experienced when you managed to wake up early before.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re really struggling to find a rhythm that works for you, and it\'s great that you\'re acknowledging the importance of establishing a healthy sleep pattern.

It\'s also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it\'s time to wind down - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches.\\n\\nGiven that you\'ve tried a lot of different alarm strategies without success, it might be helpful to focus on creating an environment that supports wakefulness, rather than relying solely on alarms. This could mean opening your curtains to let natural light in, or using a wake-up light, which simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light in your room over a set period of time.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth considering the fact that you\'re feeling demotivated and overwhelmed - it\'s possible that addressing the underlying stress and anxiety could help you feel more energized and focused.

Another strategy is to slow down while eating and pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues - sometimes our brains can take a bit to catch up with our stomachs, so giving yourself time to feel satisfied can be helpful. You might also experiment with different spices and seasonings to make your meals more flavorful, which can help you feel more satisfied with the same amount of food. Lastly, considering your budget constraints, planning your meals and snacks in advance could help you make the most of what you have and reduce the need for extra purchases. Have you tried any of these approaches or is there something specific that\'s holding you back from feeling full after meals?","gemini_comment":"Hey, I get where you\'re coming from. Feeling hungry all the time when you\'re trying to budget sucks. It\'s definitely doable to feel fuller without drastically changing your diet or aiming for weight loss.\\n\\nA couple of things to try: First, focus on fiber and protein. These take longer to digest and can really help with satiety. Think about adding a side of beans to your lunch or dinner, or maybe swapping white bread for whole wheat. Even a handful of nuts as a snack could make a difference.\\n\\nSecond, water is your friend. Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water before your meals and see if that helps curb your appetite. Also, make sure you\'re drinking enough throughout the day.\\n\\nThird, mindful eating can be surprisingly effective. Slow down, put your fork down between bites, and really focus on the taste and texture of your food. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to register that you\'re full, so eating slower gives it a chance to catch up.\\n\\nFinally, consider the volume of your food. You can increase the volume of your meals without adding a ton of calories by incorporating things like leafy greens or broth-based soups. A big salad before your main course could help you feel more satisfied with a smaller portion of the main dish. Good luck!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_q0nupo","title":"[Need advice] I\'m only living life for the next weekend","body":"I work a corporate 9 - 5 job, but because of covid and WFH, it\'s been more of a 9 - 9 kinda deal. I\'ll not get too much into it but I\'m miserable during the weekdays. I\'m also in a new job so I\'m constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here\'s what my week looks like - \\n\\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it\'s time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I\'m not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I\'m also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it\'s way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I\'m awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \\n\\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \\n\\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I\'ve been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\\n\\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","comments":{"best_comment":"I personally don\'t think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that\'s the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn\'t have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\\n\\nI can\'t speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","percentile_10_comment":"You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).","gpt_comment":"Hey there! It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but it\'s great that you\'re looking to make a change. Here are a few ideas that might help you find more balance and enjoyment in your weekdays:\\n\\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each day. This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\\n\\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.\\n\\n3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there\'s a way to manage it better. It\'s important to have time for yourself outside of work.\\n\\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.\\n\\n5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.\\n\\n6. **Seek Support**: If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies to manage stress and improve your mental health.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You\'re taking a positive step by seeking advice, and that\'s a great start!","claude_comment":"First off, working 12-hour days while WFH isn\'t sustainable - no wonder you\'re living for the weekends. This isn\'t what the next 35-40 years needs to look like, and there are several ways to make positive changes.\\n\\nStart by setting firm boundaries at work. Block your calendar for breaks, log off at a consistent time, and communicate your availability clearly to colleagues. Your mental health and performance will both improve with better work-life balance.\\n\\nInstead of viewing weekdays as something to \\"get through,\\" try building small things to look forward to throughout the week. Maybe it\'s a Monday evening hobby class, Wednesday lunch with a friend, or Thursday morning workout. These anchor points make weekdays more meaningful and break up the monotony.\\n\\nFor the food and sleep issues - they\'re connected to your current lifestyle. When we\'re stressed and unfulfilled during the week, we tend to seek comfort in food and sleep. Rather than fighting your body to get up, try going to bed earlier and establishing a proper morning routine. Even 15 minutes of morning activity (stretching, brief walk, reading) can shift your mindset for the day ahead.\\n\\nConsider finding a physical activity you enjoy and scheduling it 2-3 times during the week. Exercise helps regulate mood, sleep, and eating patterns, plus gives you something productive to focus on besides work.\\n\\nThe goal isn\'t to make weekdays as exciting as weekends, but to create a sustainable rhythm where each day has its own value. Start with one small change this week - whether that\'s setting a work boundary, adding a weekday activity, or establishing a morning routine. Build from there gradually.\\n\\nRemember that feeling stuck isn\'t the same as being stuck. You have more control over your daily experience than it might feel like right now.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling really stuck in a cycle of just trying to survive the weekdays and then overdoing it on the weekends. First, I want to acknowledge that it\'s great you\'re recognizing this pattern and wanting to make a change - that\'s a huge step. One thing that might help is to try to find small things to look forward to during the week, even if it\'s just something as simple as a favorite lunch or a short walk outside during your break. This can help break up the monotony of the weekdays and give you something to focus on besides just counting down to Friday. \\n\\nIt might also be helpful to set some boundaries around your work hours, since you mentioned you\'re working 9-9 and feeling overwhelmed. Could you try setting a specific \\"shutdown\\" time for work each day, and then do something you enjoy in the evening to signal to yourself that work is over? This could be reading, drawing, or anything else that helps you relax and feel like you\'re not still \\"on the clock\\".\\n\\nIn terms of respecting each day equally, it might be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than always looking ahead to the weekend. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can help with this. It\'s also worth considering what specific things are making your weekdays feel so boring or unfulfilling - is it the work itself, the lack of social interaction, something else? Once you identify what\'s missing, you might be able to find ways to address those needs and make the weekdays more enjoyable.\\n\\nLastly, it\'s great that you\'re aware of how your current habits are affecting your mental and physical health. Have you considered seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of these issues? They might be able to provide additional guidance and support as you try to make these changes. Remember, it\'s okay to take things one step at a time - you don\'t have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Just start with small, manageable changes and see how they stick.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I hear you. That \\"living for the weekend\\" cycle can be brutal, especially when work is draining. It sounds like you\'re stuck in a rut, but definitely not an unfixable one.\\n\\nFirst, about accepting the next 35-40 years... don\'t! That\'s a recipe for misery. Instead of thinking of it as one long, monotonous stretch, break it down. What small, achievable goals can you set for the next month, the next quarter, the next year? These don\'t have to be huge career leaps, but things that add meaning and enjoyment to your life *outside* of work. Maybe it\'s learning a new skill, exploring a hobby, or volunteering.\\n\\nSecond, tackle the weekday misery. Since you\'re WFH, can you carve out specific \\"work hours\\" and stick to them? Even if it means shutting down your computer at 5 or 6 pm, even if you haven\'t finished everything. It\'s about setting boundaries. Also, try to incorporate small joys into your weekdays. A walk during lunch, listening to a podcast while you work, or even just making a really good cup of coffee.\\n\\nThird, address the food coping mechanism. This is tough, but awareness is the first step. Instead of reaching for food when you\'re stressed or sad, try to identify the trigger and find a healthier alternative. Maybe it\'s calling a friend, doing some light exercise, or practicing mindfulness. Start small, like replacing one unhealthy snack a day with something better.\\n\\nFinally, the sleep inertia. Instead of just lying there, try to get some sunlight as soon as you wake up. Open the blinds, go for a short walk, or even just sit by a window. The light helps regulate your body\'s natural sleep-wake cycle.\\n\\nIt\'s all about small, consistent changes. Don\'t try to overhaul your entire life overnight.

Our modern world of infinite scrolling and instant gratification has really done a number on most people\'s ability to focus.\\n\\nStart by creating designated \\"deep focus\\" periods - even just 15-20 minutes at first. During these times, put your phone in another room and use website blockers if needed. The key is removing the temptation to constantly switch tasks or seek immediate stimulation.\\n\\nFor videos specifically, try making yourself watch them straight through without skipping. It\'s like training a muscle - uncomfortable at first but gets easier with practice. You can also try taking notes while watching to stay actively engaged.\\n\\nWith gaming and other activities, set a timer for 30 minutes of focused play. When the timer goes off, take a quick break, then decide if you want to continue. This helps build back the ability to stick with one thing instead of constantly seeking novelty.\\n\\nReading physical books (not ebooks) can also help retrain your attention span. Start with just 10 minutes daily and gradually increase. The lack of hyperlinks and notifications makes it easier to maintain focus.\\n\\nRemember that attention span is malleable - you can absolutely improve it with consistent practice. While getting evaluated for ADHD is a good idea, implementing these strategies can help regardless of the underlying cause.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re struggling with sustaining focus and attention, which can be really frustrating. Before exploring medical options, you might want to try a few strategies to see if you can improve your attention span on your own. One thing that could help is setting small, achievable goals for yourself when working on tasks or watching videos - this can make it feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each goal. Additionally, trying to eliminate distractions while you\'re focused on something might be helpful - turn off notifications, find a quiet space, etc. It\'s also possible that your brain is just used to the instant gratification of being able to skip around or switch between tasks quickly, so trying to practice patience and persistence could be beneficial. As for the video game thing, it\'s not uncommon for interests to wax and wane over time, but if you\'re finding that you\'re having trouble focusing on games as well, it might be worth exploring why that is - are you feeling bored with the types of games you\'re playing, or is it just hard to sit still for an extended period? Exploring these questions and trying out some new strategies might give you a better sense of what\'s going on and whether seeking medical attention is the right next step.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get where you\'re coming from. That feeling of your attention slipping away is super frustrating.

It\'s basically working in focused 25-minute bursts with short 5-minute breaks in between. It can help you trick your brain into staying engaged for those shorter periods, and then you can gradually increase the work intervals as you get better.\\n\\nSecond, think about your environment. Are you constantly bombarded with notifications or distractions? Try putting your phone on silent, closing unnecessary tabs, and finding a quiet space to work or study. Even just decluttering your desk can make a difference.\\n\\nThird, for the video skipping thing, try actively engaging with the content. Take notes, pause and summarize what you\'ve learned, or even try teaching it to someone else (even if it\'s just to your cat!). Active learning is way more engaging than passively watching.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Don\'t expect to go from zero to a hundred overnight. It\'s a process, and there will be days when you struggle. Just keep practicing, and you\'ll start to see improvement.

Then you can gradually increase the duration or difficulty as it starts feeling natural.\\n\\nAnother approach that might help break the cycle: give yourself permission to be inconsistent. Rather than viewing habits as all-or-nothing commitments that you have to maintain perfectly, treat them more like experiments. If you miss a day or even a week, just pick back up where you left off without beating yourself up about it.\\n\\nRemember that building lasting habits is more like slowly turning a ship than flipping a switch. Small, consistent actions over time will get you much further than intense bursts followed by burnout. Start smaller than you think you need to, celebrate the tiny wins, and be patient with the process.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re experiencing a common pattern of burnout from trying to stick to overly ambitious routines. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits incrementally, rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine at once. Instead of setting a goal to exercise every day, for example, try starting with just 2-3 times a week and see how that feels. You can always add more days or intensity later. \\n\\nAlso, consider prioritizing flexibility and self-care in your routine. It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the signs of burnout and depressive episodes, so make sure to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember that it\'s okay to take breaks and adjust your goals as needed - it doesn\'t mean you\'ve failed, it just means you\'re learning and adapting.\\n\\nAnother approach could be to focus on the underlying reasons why you want to build these habits, rather than just the habits themselves. What is it about exercising, reading, or studying that\'s truly important to you? Is it to feel more confident, to learn new things, or to improve your mental health? Connecting with your \\"why\\" can help make the process feel more meaningful and sustainable. \\n\\nLastly, don\'t underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory along the way, even if it feels insignificant. You\'ve already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and seeking advice, so that\'s something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, and try to be patient with yourself as you figure out what works best for you.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get that feeling of spinning your wheels. It\'s super common to get burned out when you try to overhaul everything at once. Maybe instead of focusing on a bunch of habits, try picking *one* thing and making it ridiculously easy to start.

Also, don\'t be afraid to experiment with different approaches. If you hate running, don\'t force yourself to run! Find an exercise you actually enjoy. Same with reading \u2013 try different genres or formats (audiobooks, maybe?).\\n\\nAnd remember, it\'s okay to take breaks.

Being a generalist can actually be a strength, especially in today\'s world where interdisciplinary skills are highly valued. Here\u2019s a thought: instead of forcing yourself to choose just one interest, try creating a system where you can rotate between a few of them. For example, dedicate specific days or weeks to focus on one interest at a time. This way, you can dive deep enough to make progress but still keep the novelty alive by switching it up regularly.\\n\\nAlso, consider looking for intersections between your interests. For instance, you could start a YouTube channel that combines cooking with biohacks or create a podcast that explores the data science behind evolutionary biology.

The key is learning to manage your attention strategically rather than trying to forcefully narrow yourself down to just one thing.\\n\\nConsider treating your interests like a portfolio rather than picking a single focus. You can have primary and secondary interests that get different amounts of your time and energy. This lets you maintain variety while still making meaningful progress.\\n\\nHere\'s what\'s worked for others in similar situations: Pick 2-3 interests to be your \\"core\\" focuses for the next 3-6 months. Give these the majority of your learning time. The others can be \\"background\\" interests you engage with more casually. After the time period, re-evaluate and adjust which interests are primary.\\n\\nFor example, you could focus primarily on data science and the health podcast for the next few months, while keeping cooking as a casual weekend activity. This creates structure while preserving the novelty you enjoy.\\n\\nTo maintain consistency, try:\\n- Setting specific project milestones for your primary interests\\n- Scheduling dedicated time blocks for focused work\\n- Finding ways to combine interests (like using data science to analyze cooking trends)\\n- Building accountability through sharing your progress\\n- Celebrating small wins to maintain momentum\\n\\nRemember that careers rarely require purely singular focus. Many successful people combine multiple interests - like a data scientist who does science communication through podcasting. Your variety of interests could become your unique value proposition rather than a limitation.\\n\\nThe goal isn\'t to eliminate your natural curiosity, but to channel it productively. Start with small commitments to your chosen primary interests and build from there.","llama_comment":"I totally understand where you\'re coming from - it can be tough to narrow down your interests when you\'re passionate about so many things. One strategy that might help is to think about the common threads that run through your various interests. For example, you mentioned cooking, filmography, and creating online courses - could you combine these interests by creating a YouTube channel or podcast that focuses on food and health, and incorporates elements of storytelling and visual production? By finding ways to overlap your interests, you might be able to satisfy your desire for novelty while still making progress on a specific project. \\n\\nAnother approach could be to set a \\"seasonal\\" goal for yourself - commit to focusing on one interest for a set period of time (e.g. 3-6 months), and then switch to another one. This would allow you to make progress on multiple interests without feeling like you\'re neglecting the others. It\'s also worth considering the idea that you don\'t have to choose just one career or path - many people have successful careers that involve multiple pursuits, or they pivot between different fields over time.\\n\\nIn terms of staying consistent, it might be helpful to set aside dedicated time for each of your interests, even if it\'s just a small block of time each week. This could help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed. Finally, I\'d encourage you to think about what you\'re hoping to achieve with each of your interests - is it creative expression, financial stability, personal fulfillment? By clarifying your goals, you might be able to prioritize your interests and focus on the ones that align most closely with what you want to accomplish.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get where you\'re coming from.

If you\'re most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\\n\\nLife is short, but it\'s longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone\'s success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\\n\\nFigure out what you want - it doesn\'t have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \\"to travel the world\\" or \\"to buy a house\\" or \\"get married and raise a family\\" or as simple as \\"get a job that lets you live comfortably\\". Figure out what it is.\\n\\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it.

Just decide what\'s important to you and start today, then do it every day.\\n\\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it\'s get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search.

Those thoughts you\'re having are serious, and while medication helps keep you above water, you might benefit from working with a therapist who can give you additional tools to manage those thoughts.

Writing, research, communication, and critical thinking are valuable in many fields. Have you considered content marketing, technical writing, or corporate communications?

However, I procrastinate everything until the absolute last second, even if I know about it and don\'t mean to. I always mean to do things, my brain just... Kind of shuts down if I need to do tasks? I\'m in therapy and everything, but my change isn\'t fast enough for me. \\n\\nI\'ve always gotten by in school without studying. I just pretty much cram and skim until I find answers, and it\'s ALWAYS the day of the due date. I literally procrastinated my entire senior year of high school (As in I didn\'t do any of it) until the final week. And I still PASSED. I think I huge reason why I repeat this behavior is because I still succeed. \\n\\nHowever. I want to get back into reading. I want to start editing videos again. I want to start eating healthier (Right now my main goal is to kick my binge-eating habit). And honestly I want to study. I want to be what I would consider a traditional student. It\'s just incredibly difficult for me to even do things like showering on time (Gross I know), but I\'m just always exhausted, and have never known motivation. There\'s so many things I want to do, and I keep trying and failing.

First of all, I\'m proud of you for making this far! It is amazing that you have accomplished so much with those two horses dragging you down! Congratulations! Really!\\n\\nSecond of all, asking for help is already another step foward. I also have depression and anxiety and I know how it is to have those blockdowns. That being said, how are you with social media? I found out that, for me, not having a time limit on instagram and tiktok made me scroll aimlessly between them until I feel too guilty to do anything. So what I did is that I put a time-limit on tiktok with a password and my bf set the password up, so I have no clue what it is. You could do something similar if you have someone you trust to set up a password for you. If you don\'t, you can always put the time limit yourself and it will, at least, make you remember that this is not good for you and you\'ll probably move on to do something better.\\n\\nWhen you are in a low moment of your life and just don\'t feel like doing nothing, choose a comfort movie for you and watch it. It requires no effort and, in the end, you will be feeling slightly better, maybe better enough to do one small taks like taking the garbage out. And this can become a snowball effect if you are in the mood: \\"I already done this, so I can do that other slightly bigger thing now\\" and so on.\\n\\nIn therapy, idk about you, but I sometimes hid what I was ashamed of concerning my behaviour so my therapist thought I was getting better. DON\'T BE LIKE ME! Tell all the worse and the best things to your therapist!!! Only then change can get to you faster. You need to tell everything.\\n\\nConcerning the binge-eating, idk who does the shopping at you home, but if it is you, build up the strenght to simply not buy what you binge-eat. You could also try to replace the foods with popcorn (with little butter and a pinch of salt), that is healthier, or buy more fruits and have them already saved on the fridge sliced, so that you can binge eat those. One fruit that helps me a lot (since sometimes I just don\'t have the energy to slice fruit up) is grapes. I love those green grapes that are \\"seedless\\" and they only require you wash them before you eat, so I always buy a great amount of them and when I feel the urge to eat something bc I\'m anxious I go to the fridge, grab them and there you go, eating but not those muffins I used to eat before. Nuts in general are also a good option, the thing is to control yourself to eat one at a time and not put a handful in your mouth.\\n\\nAnd finally, I know how you feel about wanting to do everything all at once and then getting frustrated because you can\'t. Try this: for this month, I want to get back to reading, so every week from now on I will choose a short story to read. If I manage to do so, I will get a book to read, and I will finish it until the end of the year (remember, set major goals that are volatile and with a large expiration date, only the minor goals within the major ones should be with an expiration date closer to you). To do so, you can say \\"I will try to read at least one page before going to bed/after waking up/during lunch\\". And you can adapt this scheme to any other goals you might have. Just remember, it is little penguin steps at a time, because if you set a goal that is minor, it is easier to go beyond that and you will feel amazing bc you did more than you have set to do. This won\'t happen if you set a major goal that is difficult to achieve right away.\\n\\n(Oh, and one more thing, if you are the competitive type, you can make a competition with yourself, like \\"I dare myself to cut this whole watermelon and put it in the fridge before this podcast episode ends\\" and  if you don\'t make it, you at least already started doing it, so you can set another challenge \\"I will do this before the sun sets\\" or something else you feel appropriate to you)\\n\\nI hope this all helps :)","percentile_10_comment":"Untreated adhd","gpt_comment":"Hey there!

In the meantime, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting - maybe start with eating one piece of fruit each day.\\n\\nRemember that failing attempts aren\'t failures - they\'re practice runs that teach you what doesn\'t work.

For example, instead of trying to become a \\"traditional student\\" overnight, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes one or two productive tasks, like reading for 15 minutes or doing a quick workout. \\n\\nIt\'s also important to acknowledge that your depression and anxiety are likely playing a role in your motivation and energy levels, so be sure to continue working with your therapist to develop strategies for managing those conditions. In terms of building motivation, you might find it helpful to identify the reasons why you want to make these changes - what is it about reading, editing videos, or eating healthier that\'s important to you? What benefits do you hope to get from developing these habits? Having a clear sense of purpose and meaning can help drive your motivation and make it easier to stick with your goals. \\n\\nLastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself if you don\'t see immediate results - building self-discipline and new habits takes time, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time. You\'ve already taken a huge step by recognizing the need for change and seeking help, so try to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through this process.","gemini_comment":"Hey, it sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you *want* to change is huge. That\'s the first step! It\'s also really common to struggle with discipline, especially when you\'ve been able to coast by on natural talent.\\n\\nSince you\'re already in therapy, that\'s a great foundation. Maybe you could specifically discuss these procrastination and motivation issues with your therapist? They might have tailored strategies for you.\\n\\nIn the meantime, try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Want to read? Don\'t aim for a chapter, aim for *one page*. Want to edit videos? Open the software. Seriously, that\'s it. The momentum of just starting can often carry you further. This is especially helpful when you\'re feeling exhausted.\\n\\nFor the binge eating, maybe focus on *adding* healthy things instead of just restricting. Like, can you add one serving of veggies to each meal? Small wins build confidence.\\n\\nAnd for the sleep thing, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. It\'s brutal at first, but it can really regulate your energy levels.\\n\\nThe key is to be patient with yourself. You\'re not going to become a super-disciplined person overnight. Celebrate the small victories, and don\'t beat yourself up when you slip up. It\'s a process, not a race.

It sounds like you\'re in a unique position with a lot of freedom but also a lot of uncertainty. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:\\n\\n1. **Identify Key Areas**: Start by listing out the main areas of your business that need attention. This could be sales, marketing, product development, etc. Once you have these, you can start to see where your time might be best spent.\\n\\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Even if your company doesn\'t set goals, you can set personal ones. Think about what success looks like for you and your team. Is it increasing revenue, improving customer satisfaction, or something else?\\n\\n3. **Time Blocking**: Try time blocking your day. Dedicate specific chunks of time to different tasks or areas. This can help you focus and ensure you\'re giving attention to all necessary parts of your business.\\n\\n4. **Weekly Reviews**: At the end of each week, review what you accomplished and what needs more attention. This can help you adjust your priorities for the following week.\\n\\n5. **Consider a Coach**: If you feel like you need more structured guidance, a business coach could be a great investment. They can provide an outside perspective and help you develop a more strategic approach to your work.\\n\\nYou might also want to check out platforms like LinkedIn or local business networks to find a coach or accountability partner. Good luck, and remember, it\'s all about finding a system that works for you!","claude_comment":"You\'re on the right track recognizing that you need a systematic approach to prioritization. While a business coach could definitely help, here are some immediate steps you can take:\\n\\nFirst, try implementing the Eisenhower Matrix for a week. Divide your tasks into four quadrants: urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not urgent/not important. This will help you identify what actually moves the needle for your business versus what just feels busy.\\n\\nFor revenue-producing activities specifically, track everything you do for 2-3 days, noting the approximate revenue impact of each activity. You\'ll likely find that 20% of your activities generate 80% of your results (Pareto Principle). These become your priorities.\\n\\nAs for structuring your day, time-blocking works well for autonomous roles. Set specific hours for your high-priority work when you\'re most productive. For example, dedicate your first 3 hours to your top revenue-generating activities before touching anything else.\\n\\nFor coaching, look into Vistage or similar executive coaching groups - they specialize in exactly what you\'re describing. They can help establish KPIs and create accountability systems tailored to your business.\\n\\nIn the meantime, start each day by writing down your top 3 revenue-impacting tasks. Don\'t move on to lower-priority items until these are complete. This simple habit can make a huge difference in your productivity and business growth.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re looking for help with prioritization and task management, which is a great step towards taking control of your day. Before hiring a coach, you might want to try implementing a simple framework like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize your tasks into urgent vs important and focus on the high-priority ones first. Additionally, you could start by identifying your core business\'s key performance indicators (KPIs) and aligning your daily tasks with those goals. This can help you determine which activities are likely to generate the most revenue. \\n\\nYou might also consider using a tool like a planner or an app like Trello or Asana to schedule and track your tasks, and set aside dedicated time for planning and review each day or week. If after trying these strategies you still feel like you need personalized guidance, then hiring a coach could be a good investment. Some popular options for finding a business coach or accountability partner include websites like Clarity.fm, Coach.me, or even local business networking groups. Have you considered reaching out to your company\'s leadership to see if they\'d be open to setting some clear goals and objectives, which could also help guide your prioritization?","gemini_comment":"Hey, that sounds like a common problem when you have a lot of freedom but not a lot of structure. It\'s great that you\'re recognizing the need for a system.\\n\\nFinding a coach or accountability partner is a solid idea. Since you\'re looking for someone with a process, maybe search for business coaches who specialize in productivity or time management for entrepreneurs or small business owners. Look for testimonials or case studies that highlight their ability to help clients prioritize tasks and create daily structures.\\n\\nIn the meantime, you could try a few things yourself. Start by listing *everything* you do in a week, even the small stuff. Then, try categorizing those tasks by impact on revenue (high, medium, low). This will give you a clearer picture of where your time is actually going. From there, you can start experimenting with time blocking \u2013 dedicating specific blocks of time to high-impact activities.

First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice\u2014acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you\'re juggling a lot, and it\'s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\\n\\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\\n\\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it\'s time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels\u2014there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\\n\\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\\n\\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\\n\\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It\u2019s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\\n\\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\\n\\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off - you\'re not alone in this struggle. Many successful people deal with similar challenges behind closed doors. The good news is you\'ve already taken two huge steps: getting diagnosed with ADHD and recognizing these issues need addressing.\\n\\nLet\'s start small. When everything feels overwhelming, trying to fix everything at once usually backfires. Pick ONE thing to focus on first - I\'d suggest your sleep schedule since that affects everything else. Start by setting a firm \\"screens off\\" time 1-2 hours before your target bedtime. Even if you can\'t sleep, just lie there in the dark. Your body needs to relearn proper sleep patterns.\\n\\nFor the immediate term, tackle your bedroom. A chaotic environment makes everything harder, especially with ADHD. Set a timer for just 20 minutes and clean what you can. Tomorrow, another 20 minutes. Don\'t try to perfect it - just make it livable.\\n\\nRegarding your law degree - you\'re so close. Instead of thinking about the whole six months, break it into tiny chunks. Study for just 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), then take a break. Even one Pomodoro per day is better than nothing. Build from there.\\n\\nFor work and motivation - external accountability helps tremendously with ADHD. Could you find a study buddy for law school? Or ask your boss for more frequent check-ins on projects? Sometimes just having to report progress to someone else can provide that extra push.\\n\\nKeep working with your doctor on the ADHD meds. Finding the right medication and dosage often takes time and experimentation. While you\'re figuring that out, focus on building small, sustainable habits rather than relying on motivation.\\n\\nYou haven\'t fooled anyone - imposter syndrome is real, but the fact that others see you as competent suggests you\'re more capable than you give yourself credit for. Take it one day at a time, one small win at a time. You\'ve got this.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re dealing with a lot of challenges that are all interconnected, which can be really overwhelming. One thing that might help is to focus on building small habits and routines that can help you gain momentum and confidence. For example, instead of trying to tackle your entire law degree at once, try setting a goal to study for just 15-20 minutes each day. That way, you can build up your endurance and make progress without feeling overwhelmed. \\n\\nSimilarly, with your energy levels and sleep issues, it might be helpful to establish a consistent bedtime routine and try to create a relaxing sleep environment. And with your motivation and productivity, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can help make them feel less daunting.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to remember that you\'re not alone in feeling like you\'re \\"fooling\\" people or that you don\'t understand things as well as you think you should. A lot of people struggle with imposter syndrome, and it\'s okay to ask for help and admit when you don\'t know something.\\n\\nIn terms of getting your apartment and finances organized, it might be helpful to start with small steps, like setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to tidy up or work on a budget. And don\'t be afraid to reach out to a financial advisor or therapist for support - they can provide you with personalized guidance and help you develop strategies to manage your debt and anxiety.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\'s okay to ask for help. You don\'t have to have everything figured out right now, and it\'s great that you\'re taking the first step by reaching out and seeking advice.

It sounds like you\'re carrying a lot right now. Let\'s break this down into smaller, manageable steps.\\n\\nFirst, tackle the physical stuff. Your health and environment are foundational. Since you\'re already eating healthy but not losing weight, maybe get a check-up with your doctor to rule out any underlying issues, especially given the fatigue and sleep problems. Addressing the sleep is crucial. Try setting a strict bedtime routine \u2013 even if you don\'t fall asleep right away, dim the lights, avoid screens, and try some relaxation techniques. Consistency is key here. As for the apartment, don\'t try to clean everything at once. Pick *one* small area, like your bedside table, and focus only on that. Once that\'s done, move on to the next small area. Small wins build momentum.\\n\\nNext, let\'s look at the law degree. Six months is a relatively short time. Can you break down your remaining coursework into tiny, achievable tasks? Instead of \\"study law,\\" think \\"read one page of my textbook\\" or \\"review my notes for 15 minutes.\\" Set a timer and commit to just that small amount of time. You might find that once you get started, you can keep going. If not, that\'s okay too. You still accomplished something.\\n\\nFor the job, talk to your manager. Explain that you\'re working on improving your time management and ask for specific feedback on deadlines. Sometimes just having a clear understanding of expectations can reduce anxiety.\\n\\nFinally, regarding feeling \\"dumb,\\" remember that everyone has imposter syndrome sometimes. Focus on your strengths and what you *do* know. Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to where you were yesterday.\\n\\nThe key here is to start small, be consistent, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it seems.

Think stir-fries, salads, or one-pot meals that take 20-30 minutes max. \\n\\n2. **Batch Prep Ingredients**: Instead of full meals, prep ingredients twice a week. Chop veggies, marinate proteins, or cook grains in advance. This way, you can mix and match to create fresh meals quickly.\\n\\n3. **Use a Slow Cooker or Instant Pot**: These can be lifesavers. You can throw everything in before work and come home to a ready meal.

Instead of jumping straight into complex meal prep, focus on quick, nutritious meals that take 15-20 minutes max.\\n\\nSome game-changers: keep pre-chopped vegetables in the fridge (way easier than meal prep, still fresh), and always have eggs, canned beans, and quick-cooking proteins on hand. A simple stir-fry with pre-cut veggies and chicken takes barely any time. Sheet pan dinners are also great - just toss everything on a pan and let the oven do the work while you rest your eyes.\\n\\nFor the screen fatigue, try the 20-20-20 rule during work: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It makes a huge difference in evening energy levels.\\n\\nThe key is making cooking as effortless as possible when you\'re tired. Start with just 2-3 really simple recipes you can make on autopilot. Once those become habit, you can expand your repertoire. Remember, a basic homemade meal is still way better than takeout, so don\'t feel pressure to make anything fancy.\\n\\nAlso, consider doing the bare minimum prep (like washing vegetables or marinating meat) in the morning when you\'re fresher. Even 5 minutes of morning prep makes evening cooking much more manageable.","llama_comment":"I totally get where you\'re coming from - it can be tough to muster up the energy to cook after a long day of staring at screens.

That way, I\'m not feeling overwhelmed by a complicated recipe when I\'m already exhausted. \\n\\nAnother strategy you might consider is breaking down your cooking into smaller tasks, like chopping veggies or marinating proteins, that you can do at different times of the day when you have a bit more energy. Then, when it\'s time to cook, it feels less daunting because some of the prep work is already done.\\n\\nSince you\'re looking to do two meal preps per week, you might also think about cooking in bulk on those days, but then portioning out individual servings that can be reheated quickly throughout the week. That way, you\'re not eating \\"stale\\" food, but you\'re still getting the benefits of having healthy meals ready to go. \\n\\nLastly, don\'t be too hard on yourself if some nights you just can\'t cook - it\'s okay to have a backup plan, like a simple salad or some scrambled eggs, that requires minimal effort but still gets you a nutritious meal.

That way, during the week, you\'re just assembling things, not starting from scratch. It feels fresher than fully prepped meals.\\n\\nSecond, embrace quick & easy recipes. Think stir-fries, sheet pan dinners, or big salads. These can be thrown together in under 30 minutes. Websites like Budget Bytes or Skinnytaste have tons of ideas.\\n\\nThird, consider your \\"eye fatigue\\" trigger. Maybe blue light glasses or adjusting your screen brightness could help you feel less drained at the end of the day. Even a short break away from the screen every hour can make a difference. If you can tackle the eye fatigue, you might find you have more energy overall.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. If you slip up and order takeout one night, don\'t beat yourself up.

I have deadlines to meet every 3 weeks. I have about 30 hours worth of work to do over the course of those 3 weeks whenever I want. This is a HORRIBLE system for a procrastinator.\\n\\nI literally do nothing for 2.5 weeks. I ride bikes/train 15 hours a week, I play video games, I play chess, I watch youtube, I watch netflix. Anything except work. The dread of the deadline is always hanging over me. I hate the office work so much and it brings on an incredible amount stress when I\'m trying to complete a 30 hour report in 2 days.\\n\\nI travel 25% for this job and travel weeks are 40 to 60 hour work weeks. I find that to be so much more satisfying and less stressful. The travel is one of the few reasons I haven\'t left yet. It\'s crazy that I enjoy working 60 hours a week, living out of a hotel, more than working 10 hours a week from home.\\n\\nI wake up everyday and I have an easy list of work things I want to complete that day. Every night I go to bed completing none of it and the stress continues to build for the next day. Then miraculously when I know I have no more time, I find the energy to work two 15 hour work days in a row. I seriously need help. I can\'t live like this anymore.","comments":{"best_comment":"I have a spreadsheet, which has all of the tasks I need to do for a project and percentages next to each task.

I was stressed first from the work, then from my procrastination, and finally from the social anxiety of not wanting to face my failure.\\n\\nBut when I finally got the call and was terminated, I honestly just felt relieved. I knew I was burnt out and feeling isolated, and I knew that it was affecting my work ethic as well as my mental health. I think it is also a wake up call for me, and maybe I am just someone who needs to be in office in order to focus. No shame in that, everyone is different. I love the idea of wfh and wish I could have made it work, but I just lost all motivation.\\n\\nSorry I do not have advice, just here to let you know that you are not alone.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help you manage your time better and reduce that last-minute stress:\\n\\n1. **Break it Down**: Try breaking your 30-hour workload into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the entire report, focus on completing a small section each day. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\\n\\n2. **Set a Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes dedicated work hours. Even if it\'s just a couple of hours each day, having a set time to focus on work can help you build a habit and reduce procrastination.\\n\\n3. **Use Timers**: Consider using the Pomodoro Technique\u2014work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make the work feel less daunting.\\n\\n4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself small rewards for completing tasks. It could be as simple as a coffee break or a quick game. This can help motivate you to get started and keep going.\\n\\n5. **Reflect on Travel Weeks**: Since you find travel weeks more satisfying, try to identify what aspects of those weeks make you more productive. Is it the structure, the change of environment, or something else? See if you can incorporate some of those elements into your home routine.\\n\\nRemember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Your situation with work-from-home procrastination is actually pretty common, especially with flexible deadlines. The good news is that you already know you work well under different conditions (like during travel weeks), which gives us some clues about what might help.\\n\\nFirst, try recreating some of that \\"travel week structure\\" at home. Set specific work hours and treat them like you would if you were at a client site. Getting dressed for work and having a dedicated workspace can help shift your mindset from \\"home mode\\" to \\"work mode.\\"\\n\\nSince you\'re clearly capable of intense focus (those 15-hour crunch days prove that), consider using the Pomodoro Technique. Start with just 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. Even one or two \\"pomodoros\\" a day is better than nothing, and you\'ll likely find yourself wanting to do more once you start.\\n\\nBreak down that 30 hours of work into smaller daily chunks. Instead of thinking \\"I have 30 hours to do whenever,\\" schedule specific tasks for specific days. Make them non-negotiable appointments with yourself, just like you would treat client meetings during travel weeks.\\n\\nYou might also benefit from body-doubling - working alongside someone else, even virtually. There are online co-working spaces and Discord channels where people work together silently. This can help recreate that sense of accountability you feel when working on-site.\\n\\nRemember, you don\'t have to transform everything overnight. Start with small changes - maybe commit to working just 2 hours each morning before allowing yourself to bike or play chess. Build from there. The goal is to spread that work out so you can actually enjoy your free time without the constant dread of looming deadlines.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re struggling with a common problem known as \\"time inconsistency\\" - you prioritize short-term leisure over long-term goals, even when it leads to more stress and discomfort in the end. One strategy that might help is to break down your 30 hours of work into smaller, manageable chunks, and schedule them into your calendar just like you would any other non-negotiable appointment. This could be as simple as committing to work 2-3 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or whatever schedule works best for you.\\n\\nAdditionally, you might consider implementing some \\"implementation intentions\\" - specific plans for when and where you will work on your tasks. For example, \\"If it\'s Monday at 9am, then I will work on my report for 2 hours.\\" This can help make your goals feel more concrete and achievable.\\n\\nIt\'s also interesting that you mention enjoying your travel weeks more than working from home, despite the longer hours. This might suggest that having a structured schedule and clear deadlines can actually be helpful for you, even if it feels restrictive at first. You could try to replicate some of that structure while working from home, by setting clear goals and deadlines for yourself, and establishing a dedicated workspace that helps you get into \\"work mode\\".\\n\\nLastly, don\'t underestimate the power of small wins - completing a single task or making progress on your report can give you a sense of momentum and motivation that can carry over into the next day. Try to focus on making progress, rather than being perfect, and see if that helps you build some discipline and consistency into your work routine.","gemini_comment":"Hey, I totally get the struggle. That \\"freedom\\" can be a real trap sometimes. It sounds like you\'re not lacking the ability to work hard, just the structure to do it consistently at home.\\n\\nHere\'s a thought: since you enjoy the travel weeks, try to mimic that structure at home. Could you create a \\"travel day\\" routine even when you\'re not traveling? Maybe that means waking up at the same time, getting dressed as if you were going to the office (even if it\'s just nicer sweats!), and designating a specific workspace that\'s only for work.\\n\\nAlso, break down that 30-hour report into much smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of \\"work on report,\\" try \\"write the introduction\\" or \\"find three sources.\\" Make those tasks so small you can\'t say no to them. Even 15 minutes of focused work is better than zero.\\n\\nFinally, consider timeboxing. Allocate specific blocks of time for work, even if it\'s just an hour or two each day. Set a timer, and when it goes off, you\'re done for that block. This can help you avoid burnout and build momentum. Good luck, you got this!\\n"}},{"id":"t3_se5nrl","title":"[Advice] I can\'t eat the 3000 calories I need every day to add mass muscle and I need advice","body":"I\'m a guy who has generally always been insecure about his body because I was always so skinny.

I just want to have some muscles (I don\'t want too much either). \\n\\nThe problem is that my high school is far from my house and I always get up very early and stressed to get there. \\nTherefore, I have a bad breakfast. \\n\\nAlthough I eat well in high school, once I return home it takes a long time and when I arrive I am usually too tired and stressed to start studying everything that accumulates on me. \\n\\nSummary: I am a person who had low self-esteem and I am improving, but I cannot follow my diet because my routine is impossible. And of course, I can only go to gym 2 days a week :(\\n\\nAny advice to those who are now following a diet and going to the gym?","comments":{"best_comment":"Hey man, the easiest way to up your calories is through calorie dense food. Try adding a tablespoon or two of natural peanut butter to smoothies or protein shakes, a bit of olive oil to salads or roasted veggies, and snack on nuts. \\n\\nWhole milk is also really great for gaining mass. Decently calorie dense with a good amount of protein and fats.\\n\\nOther healthy, calorie dense foods with decent protein include avocado, chicken with the skin on and naturally oily fish.","percentile_10_comment":"First off, how much did you eat before 3000 calories?\\n\\nYou\'ve got the human anatomy working against you. Stomach distensibility (how the stomach stretches when you eat food) is something that you can\'t change overnight. For underweight people, their stomach barely stretches so it feels painful to eat more than their usual portion. For overweight people, their stomach stretches a lot so eating less than usual makes them feel excessively hungry.\\n\\nThis is why you should go with a gradual increase in calories. Plus, the bigger your calorie surplus is, the more fat you\'re putting on, not muscle. Your ideal surplus should be about 300-500 kcal above your maintenance per day, irrespective of how much you weigh.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! First off, it\'s awesome to hear about the progress you\'ve made in building your self-esteem and making positive changes in your life. When it comes to gaining muscle mass, consistency is key, even if your schedule is tight. Here are a few tips that might help:\\n\\n1. **Meal Prep**: Try preparing your meals in advance. You can cook in bulk on weekends or whenever you have some free time. This way, you can have calorie-dense meals ready to go, which can help you hit your calorie goals without having to cook every day.\\n\\n2. **Calorie-Dense Foods**: Incorporate more calorie-dense foods into your diet. Things like nuts, seeds, avocados, and whole grains can help you increase your calorie intake without feeling like you\'re eating a ton of food.\\n\\n3. **Smoothies**: Consider making smoothies with protein powder, fruits, oats, and nut butter. They\'re quick to make, easy to consume, and can pack a lot of calories and nutrients.\\n\\n4. **Snacking**: Keep healthy snacks with you throughout the day. Things like protein bars, trail mix, or yogurt can be great for getting extra calories in between meals.\\n\\n5. **Efficient Workouts**: Since you can only hit the gym twice a week, focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups. This will maximize your time and help you build muscle more effectively.\\n\\nRemember, progress takes time, and it\'s great that you\'re already on the right path. Keep at it, and don\'t be too hard on yourself. You\'re doing great!","claude_comment":"First off, congrats on the progress you\'ve made with your self-image and overall lifestyle improvements. That\'s seriously impressive and shows you\'ve got what it takes to make positive changes.\\n\\nFor your specific situation with calories and gym time, here are some practical workarounds:\\n\\nMeal prep is going to be your best friend. On weekends, prepare several days worth of high-calorie meals and snacks. Pack portable options you can easily eat during your commute or between classes - think nuts, protein bars, peanut butter sandwiches, or protein shakes.\\n\\nSpeaking of shakes - they\'re a game changer for getting calories in when you\'re busy. Mix protein powder, oats, peanut butter, banana, and whole milk. You can easily get 800-1000 calories in one shake. Make it the night before and drink it during your morning commute.\\n\\nAs for only having 2 gym days - that\'s totally workable for a beginner. Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc.) to maximize your limited gym time. The key is consistency with those 2 days rather than trying to force more sessions into an already packed schedule.\\n\\nRemember that building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. Small, sustainable changes you can maintain will get you much further than trying to make dramatic changes that burn you out. Start with getting your breakfast and post-school nutrition sorted, then build from there.\\n\\nWhen you\'re feeling overwhelmed, just focus on the next meal, the next workout. You\'ve already proven you can make positive changes in other areas of your life - this is just another challenge to tackle one step at a time.","llama_comment":"It\'s great that you\'ve made significant progress in building your self-esteem and improving various aspects of your life. Now, tackling your nutrition and fitness goals is a fantastic next step. Given your busy schedule and limited time for the gym, it\'s essential to focus on making the most of your diet and workouts. \\n\\nFirstly, consider meal prepping or planning your meals in advance, especially for breakfast and post-school snacks. This can help ensure you\'re getting a balanced mix of nutrients even on hectic days. You might also look into calorie-dense foods that are easy to consume quickly, such as nuts, dried fruits, or energy bars, to help meet your daily caloric needs without feeling too full.\\n\\nFor your gym days, prioritize compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, which work multiple muscle groups at once. This will help you make the most of your limited gym time. Additionally, look into bodyweight exercises or resistance band workouts that you can do on your non-gym days to keep your muscles active.\\n\\nLastly, don\'t underestimate the importance of rest and recovery. With a stressful schedule, it\'s crucial to get enough sleep (aim for 7-9 hours) and allow your muscles time to recover between workouts. This will help your body adapt to the demands you\'re placing on it and support muscle growth.\\n\\nRemember, consistency and patience are key. You\'ve already shown that you can make significant changes in your life, so apply that same determination to your fitness journey. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don\'t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two - just get back on track as soon as you can. Good luck!","gemini_comment":"Hey, congrats on the progress you\'ve made so far! It sounds like you\'ve tackled some big challenges already, and that\'s awesome.\\n\\nRegarding the calorie intake, 3000 is a lot, especially with a busy schedule. Don\'t feel like you need to hit that number perfectly every single day. Consistency is key, not perfection.\\n\\nSince mornings are tough, could you prep a high-calorie shake the night before? Throw in some protein powder, oats, banana, peanut butter, and milk (or a dairy-free alternative). It\'s quick to drink on the go and packs a lot of calories.\\n\\nFor when you get home, try to break down your studying into smaller chunks. Maybe eat a quick, calorie-dense snack (nuts, Greek yogurt, etc.) *before* you start studying. That way, you\'re fueling your brain and body. Then, set a timer for 25 minutes of focused studying, followed by a 5-minute break. During the break, you could have another small snack. This can make the whole process less overwhelming.\\n\\nAlso, two gym days are better than zero! Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows) to get the most bang for your buck. Make sure you\'re progressively overloading (lifting slightly heavier or doing more reps each week).\\n\\nFinally, be patient with yourself. Building muscle takes time and consistency. Don\'t get discouraged if you don\'t see results immediately. Keep showing up, keep making small improvements, and you\'ll get there.

First off, it\'s great that you\'re reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you\'re juggling a lot, and it\'s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\\n\\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\\n\\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\\n\\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\\n\\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\\n\\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don\'t feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn\'t have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\\n\\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\\n\\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off - you\'re not a failure. You have a job, you\'re in school, you take care of your appearance, and most importantly - you WANT to improve. That\'s a solid foundation to build from.\\n\\nLet\'s tackle this step by step. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE small habit to master first. Since you mentioned feeling physically bad, let\'s start with water intake. Get a large water bottle and keep it with you always. Set specific times to drink - when you wake up, with meals, etc. Make it dead simple.\\n\\nFor the binge eating, especially on non-medication days, try planning your meals in advance. Prep healthy snacks and meals when you\'re on Vyvanse and feeling motivated. That way, when the harder days come, you just need to heat up what\'s already made. The goal isn\'t perfection - it\'s making the healthy choice slightly easier than the unhealthy one.\\n\\nFor productivity and focus, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day. Your brain is like a muscle - you need to gradually build up its capacity for sustained focus. Don\'t expect to maintain the same productivity level off-medication as on it. Instead, adjust your expectations and create different routines for different days.\\n\\nWhen you slip up (which everyone does), don\'t view it as starting over. Think of it like GPS recalculating - you\'re just finding a new route to the same destination. Keep a simple journal noting what triggers your binges or productivity dips. This info will help you adjust your strategy over time.\\n\\nRemember: discipline isn\'t about being perfect every day. It\'s about showing up consistently and making slightly better choices over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re really struggling with developing discipline and breaking free from some tough habits, especially when it comes to food and motivation. First, let\'s acknowledge that it\'s amazing you\'re recognizing these patterns and wanting to make a change - that\'s a huge step. \\n\\nGiven your ADHD diagnosis and medication schedule, it might be helpful to focus on building small, manageable habits on your non-medication days. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start with tiny goals like drinking one extra glass of water or taking a short 10-minute walk. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to address the binge eating and emotional relationship with food. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders - they can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues. \\n\\nIn terms of rewiring your brain for discipline, it\'s not about being perfect, but about making progress. You might find it helpful to set clear, achievable goals for yourself, break them down into smaller tasks, and create an environment that supports those goals (e.g., removing tempting foods from your home, finding a workout buddy, etc.). \\n\\nRemember, discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it\'s okay if you don\'t see immediate results. It\'s about showing up every day, making small efforts, and being kind to yourself when you slip up. You\'re not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you develop the habits and discipline you\'re looking for.

When you\'ve nailed that, add another small change.\\n\\nFor the food and phone cravings, try to identify your triggers. When do you usually reach for those things? Can you replace them with something else? Maybe a walk, a quick meditation, or even just a different app on your phone. There are apps that can help you limit your time on social media, which might be useful.\\n\\nAbout your meds, have you talked to your doctor about how you\'re feeling on and off them? Maybe there\'s a tweak that could help with the binge eating on your off days. It\'s also worth exploring therapy, especially for the binge eating disorder. A therapist can give you tools to manage those urges and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\\n\\nAs for staying focused, the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks) can be really helpful for ADHD. It breaks down tasks into manageable chunks and gives you built-in rewards.\\n\\nFinally, remember that setbacks are normal. Don\'t beat yourself up if you slip up.

(This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you\u2019re not really doing anything in that hour.)\\n\\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don\u2019t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you\u2019ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \\n\\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.","gpt_comment":"Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking such proactive steps with your program and recognizing the need for change. That\'s a huge first step. When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. \\n\\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. \\n\\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you\'re going through. \\n\\nRemember, it\'s okay to have off days. The important thing is to not let a slip turn into a fall. Be kind to yourself and focus on getting back on track the next day. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off, props for taking action by enrolling in that program and sticking with it for a month - that\'s already a huge win. Your 4-item daily list sounds really solid and manageable too.\\n\\nFor staying consistent while dealing with mental health challenges, I\'ve found that treating slip-ups differently made a massive difference. Instead of viewing a missed day as a total reset, think of it like missing a meal - you wouldn\'t stop eating entirely just because you missed lunch, right? You\'d just eat your next meal.\\n\\nA few practical tools that might help:\\n\\nThe \\"Streaks\\" app is great for tracking daily habits and gives you a visual of your progress. Having that reminder and seeing your streak build up can be really motivating.\\n\\nFor accountability, check out the Discord server for this subreddit (in the sidebar). There are channels specifically for daily check-ins and support. Having people to report to daily makes a big difference.\\n\\nOne technique that\'s helped me push through tough mental health days is the \\"5-minute rule\\" - commit to just 5 minutes of an activity. Often you\'ll find yourself wanting to continue once you start, but if not, you still succeeded by doing those 5 minutes.\\n\\nStart tomorrow, but remember: progress isn\'t linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that\'s completely normal. What matters is picking back up and continuing forward, even if it\'s just with those 5 minutes.","llama_comment":"It\'s great that you\'ve recognized the pattern of slipping back into depression and isolation, and you\'re taking proactive steps to change it. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Since you have a list of 4 things you want to do daily, try to create an environment that supports those habits. For example, lay out your workout clothes the night before, or put a reminder on your phone to meditate at the same time every day. \\n\\nIt\'s also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it\'s okay to have off days. Instead of beating yourself up over slipping up, try to learn from it and get back on track as soon as possible. You might find it helpful to track your progress in a journal or use an app like Habitica or HabitBull to monitor your habits and stay accountable.\\n\\nAdditionally, having a support system in place can make a huge difference. Since you\'re already in a therapy program, you might want to discuss your struggles with your therapist and see if they can offer any additional guidance or support. You could also consider joining online communities or forums for people with social anxiety disorder, where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s all about progress, not perfection. You\'ve already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and wanting to change, so try to focus on the small wins and celebrate your successes along the way. Good luck starting tomorrow, and don\'t hesitate to reach out if you need any further support or guidance!","gemini_comment":"Hey, it\'s awesome you\'re taking such proactive steps! It\'s totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when tackling social anxiety, especially with the risk of slipping into depression.\\n\\nOne thing that\'s helped me is focusing on *progress, not perfection*. You mentioned that slipping once feels like a huge setback. Instead of viewing it that way, try to see it as a data point. If you miss a day, ask yourself *why*. Was the goal too ambitious? Were you too tired? Then adjust accordingly. Maybe break down your \\"one social thing\\" into even smaller, more manageable steps. Like, day 1: just walk to the store. Day 2: walk in and browse for 2 minutes. Day 3: ask an employee a question.\\n\\nAlso, be kind to yourself. You\'re dealing with a lot. Celebrate the small wins. Did you meditate for 5 minutes instead of 10? Great! You still meditated.\\n\\nFor accountability, have you considered finding an online support group specifically for social anxiety? Sharing your experiences and challenges with others who understand can be incredibly validating and motivating. There are also habit tracking apps like Streaks or Habitica that can gamify the process and make it more engaging.\\n\\nFinally, remember that therapy is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be ups and downs. The important thing is to keep showing up for yourself.

It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:\\n\\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.\\n\\n2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.\\n\\n3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\\n\\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.\\n\\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you\'re feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\\n\\nRemember, it\'s never too late to make changes and improve your life.

First off, 31 is still young - you\'ve got plenty of time to build the life you want. It\'s good that you already have fitness as a cornerstone habit and some savings to work with. Let\'s build on that foundation.\\n\\nStart by creating a simple daily routine. Since you\'re already into fitness, use that as your anchor. Add one small habit at a time - maybe reading for 15 minutes after your workout, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill online. The key is consistency over intensity.\\n\\nFor the career front, consider what interests naturally align with your fitness background. Personal training, health coaching, or even fitness-related content creation could be worth exploring. Or you might want to go in a completely different direction - that\'s fine too. Pick one direction and take small steps: update your resume, apply to one job daily, or take an online course in your chosen field.\\n\\nFor building relationships, look for local fitness groups or sports leagues. These give you a natural way to meet people while doing something you\'re already comfortable with. Meetup.com can be good for finding groups aligned with whatever interests you develop as you explore new activities.\\n\\nRemember that everyone you meet who seems to \\"have it together\\" went through their own period of feeling lost. The difference is they kept moving forward, even if they weren\'t sure of the destination. Focus on taking one small action each day that moves you toward a better life, whether that\'s applying for a job, learning something new, or meeting new people. Progress compounds over time.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, which is totally understandable given everything you\'ve been through. First, let\'s acknowledge that it\'s great you have some savings to fall back on and that you\'re taking care of your physical health through fitness - those are definitely positives to build on. \\n\\nOne thing that might help is to start small and focus on building one or two new habits or routines outside of fitness. This could be something as simple as reading for 30 minutes each day, learning a new skill or hobby, or volunteering in your community. Sometimes, having a sense of purpose or feeling like we\'re making progress in one area can help spill over into other areas of our lives.\\n\\nIt\'s also worth considering seeking out some professional help, whether that\'s a therapist or counselor, to work through some of the underlying issues that might be contributing to your feelings of depression and isolation. They can help you develop strategies for managing your emotions and improving your relationships with others.\\n\\nAs for feeling like you\'re making a difference in people\'s lives, that\'s a really admirable goal.

Think about what aspects of fitness you enjoy \u2013 is it the structure, the physical challenge, the feeling of accomplishment?

Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I\'m not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn\'t even went to give my exams \\n\\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \\n\\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \\n\\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don\'t  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don\'t distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \\n\\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I\'m gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow.

Commit to working on something for just 5 minutes. After that, you can stop if you want to. What usually happens is that once you start, you\'ll often want to continue since the hardest part - getting started - is over.\\n\\nAnother technique is to reframe the task. Instead of seeing it as something you need to do perfectly, view it as an experiment or practice run. You\'re not committing to a final product, you\'re just exploring and learning.

When I told my grandma I got a C+, she became very upset and asked why. It makes sense as she helped pay for the 2 classes.

I\u2019ve tried a planner, it helps, but I still fall into the same trap of not doing my work. I know I can do well if I put my mind to it, but I just can\u2019t find the motivation/energy to do it. Its fucking stressful. I\u2019m stuck in a self-fulfilling loop of laziness and stress and I fucking hate it and myself for doing it.

Procrastination is something many of us struggle with, so you\'re definitely not alone. Here are a few strategies that might help:\\n\\n1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**: Sometimes the thought of completing a big task can be overwhelming. Try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it easier to start and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\\n\\n2. **Set Specific Goals**: Instead of telling yourself you\'ll study for a class, set a specific goal like \\"I\'ll review chapters 1-3 for 30 minutes.\\" This gives you a clear target to aim for.\\n\\n3. **Use a Timer**: The Pomodoro Technique can be really effective. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and prevent burnout.\\n\\n4. **Find Your Peak Productivity Time**: Everyone has different times of the day when they\'re most productive. Try to schedule your most challenging tasks during these times.\\n\\n5. **Accountability Partner**: Sometimes having someone to check in with can help keep you on track. This could be a friend, family member, or even a study group.\\n\\n6. **Reflect on Your Motivation**: Remind yourself why you\'re doing this. Whether it\'s maintaining your scholarship or achieving personal goals, keeping your motivation in mind can help push you through tough times.\\n\\nRemember, building discipline is a process, and it\'s okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"First off - you\'re not lazy. Procrastination isn\'t about laziness, it\'s about emotional regulation and habits. The fact that you\'re reaching out for help shows you care deeply about improving.\\n\\nThe \\"smart kid\\" label can actually work against us sometimes. When things came easily before, we don\'t develop the skills to handle harder challenges. Now you\'re facing university-level work that requires different strategies.\\n\\nHere\'s what\'s worked for many chronic procrastinators:\\n\\nStart ridiculously small. Instead of \\"I need to study for 3 hours,\\" tell yourself \\"I\'ll read one paragraph.\\" Often you\'ll continue once you\'ve started, but if not, that\'s fine - you met your goal. Build trust with yourself through these tiny wins.\\n\\nUse the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Don\'t worry about being perfect - even 10 minutes of focused work is better than nothing. There are great free apps for this.\\n\\nCreate a dedicated study space that\'s only for work. Your brain will start associating that space with productivity rather than procrastination.\\n\\nMost importantly: forgive yourself when you slip up. Beating yourself up creates more stress, which leads to more procrastination. Instead, treat each day as a fresh start.\\n\\nConsider talking to your university\'s academic support services. Many students struggle with this transition, and they have resources specifically for building better study habits.\\n\\nRemember: this is a skill you\'re developing, not a character flaw. With consistent small steps and self-compassion, you can absolutely turn this around.","llama_comment":"It sounds like you\'re really struggling with procrastination and it\'s affecting your academic performance and self-esteem. First, let\'s acknowledge that having a full-ride scholarship is a huge opportunity, and it\'s great that you\'re recognizing the value of it. Now, about breaking the cycle of procrastination - it might be helpful to identify the underlying reasons why you\'re putting things off. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what\'s driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to overcome it. \\n\\nYou\'ve tried using a planner, which is a great start. Another technique you could try is breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and setting specific deadlines for each one. This might help make your workload feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, you could try implementing the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to remember that motivation and energy aren\'t always going to be there, but discipline and habits can help carry you through. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try creating a routine and sticking to it, even when you don\'t feel like it. And hey, it\'s okay to not be perfect - it\'s better to make progress and learn from your mistakes than to let procrastination hold you back.

It\'s a signal to adjust, not a reason to beat yourself up.\\n\\nSince planners haven\'t fully solved it, try breaking down your tasks into *tiny* steps. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of \\"write essay,\\" try \\"open document and type my name.\\" Seriously. The goal is to make the initial step so easy you can\'t say no. Once you\'ve started, the momentum often carries you further.\\n\\nAlso, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique. Work in focused 25-minute bursts with short breaks. It can help with focus and make the task seem less daunting. There are tons of free apps for this.\\n\\nFinally, think about *why* you\'re procrastinating. Is it fear of failure? Boredom? If you can pinpoint the underlying reason, you can start to address it directly. Maybe talk to a counselor at your university; they\'re usually free and can offer strategies tailored to you.

It just seems like they\u2019re culminating in a way now, making the overall situation worse.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI procrastinate to the point of being self-destructive. For a long time, throughout school and beyond, putting things off over and over worked out perfectly fine, because with a little bit of last-minute crunch I was able to achieve most things, and the consequences for when I couldn\u2019t were mild. In hindsight, this never forced me to develop the necessary skills and discipline for working continuously on projects, or myself in general. What little I have in that regard has been a struggle to acquire. However, it\u2019s not even universal. I absolutely hate going to the gym, but I still do it regularly anyway. So, objectively, I can get off my ass repeatedly. I have some methods to restrain myself. But more often than not, I push of the important things over and over. Sometimes critically important things. So much so that it seems like I don\u2019t care about myself at all. Going out of my way for other people is no problem, for me though\u2026\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have developed some agarophobia during the pandemic, and probably anxiety about confronting people, f.e. clerks for bureaucratic concerns, doctors appointments and so on. I\u2019ve always been introverted, but not averse to people in general. Ever since the lockdowns, going out somewhere is suddenly a matter of discipline. Some instance in my brain just doesn\u2019t want me to go anywhere, and I have to force myself through that every time, even though it\u2019s not even particularly bad. Of course, this exacerbates the procrastination.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI lie, reflexively, all the time, and then commit to those lies unnecessarily. About my plans for the day, about how I\u2019m feeling, how a particular thing is progressing, a bunch of different things, really. Upon reflection, those lies seem to aid all the things above, as well as being more comforting than the truth for people around me. As if, in the moment, lying is quicker than explaining myself thoroughly, while the truth just makes the other party concerned, but still unable to help anyway. On top of this idiocy, I then commit to those lies to appear consistent, like having said I\u2019m going to X at a certain time, and then \u201chaving to\u201d go somewhere, like to public library, and working on something that isn\u2019t even urgent.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI waste time, instead, with things that aren\u2019t even important to me. When I put off a phone call and rather start cooking something elaborate and then thoroughly enjoy it with other people, it\u2019s still not ideal, but I\u2019m mostly fine with it. Most of the time though, a part of my brain just seem to go like \u201cavoid X at all cost\u201d and fills the space \u201cuntil\u201d X with anything and everything. Youtube, games, chats with people, cleaning, researching, reading, doomscrolling, walking\u2026 Anything trivial. The large majority of which I won\u2019t even remember the day after. Concerning is, how oftentimes I don\u2019t even register that I\u2019m purposefully avoiding something in the moment. It\u2019s like being on autopilot, or a drunken binge. REALLY concerning is, that even when I do realize what I\u2019m doing (or rather not doing) I can\u2019t reliably lift myself out of it, and start. If I do, it is incredibly taxing. If I don\u2019t, it feels almost dissociative, like I\u2019m bewildered how I don\u2019t care enough about this/myself.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI also might have dampened my emotional responses somehow. When observing other people, having similar issues, they\u2019re kickstarted into action by strong emotions, even without discipline. Their pride, self-loathing, feeling of obligation, spite, or concern about themselves or others are a strong impetus. Like a safety line, before things get too out of hand. I do have these feelings, but I sometimes wonder why they are so soft, and incongruent with the circumstances. I know this isn\u2019t the solution to the overall problem, said people still procrastinate after all. But it contributes to my confusion how to approach this in general.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\u2019m not clinically depressed. I really wish I was, that would be a comparatively easy solution. But that\u2019s been eliminated by a psychiatrist for a while. I can\u2019t seek psychiatric help either, though. In my country, ever since the lockdowns, those services have been utterly overwhelmed. If you\u2019re not suffering severely, or aren\u2019t a risk to yourself, or others, there\u2019s simply no space at the moment. Waiting lists for appointments are 6-8 months. However, I need to do something NOW. Even more so, if I need to start with incremental change, which, unless any of you can provide a different epiphany, I obviously do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I\u2019m turning to this corner of the internet, to see if any of you kind people have experience and input that could be helpful for me. Objectively, I\u2019m good at assessing my situation and what needs to be done, what my needs are, how to provide for them properly, etc. What I struggle with is the application, the methods, the battle between my brain tricking me, and me tricking my brain. And figuring out where to start in this mess. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.\\n\\n(Also, this has bloated a lot. If you\u2019ve read this far, that deserves a Thank you all on its own.

When you catch yourself about to lie, pause and ask why you\'re doing it. Sometimes just acknowledging the truth to yourself can be a powerful step toward change.\\n\\nLastly, since you mentioned anxiety about going out, try to gradually expose yourself to these situations. Start with something low-stakes and build up from there. It might also help to have a friend or family member accompany you for support.\\n\\nRemember, change takes time, and it\'s okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Thanks for sharing your situation so openly. The good news is that you already have some discipline (as shown by your gym habit) and strong self-awareness about your patterns. That\'s actually a huge advantage for making changes.\\n\\nLet\'s focus on starting small and building from there. Since you mentioned needing to do something NOW, here\'s what I suggest:\\n\\nStart with a 5-minute rule for tasks you\'re avoiding. When you notice yourself going into avoidance mode, commit to just 5 minutes of the important task. Often you\'ll find yourself continuing past those 5 minutes once you\'ve broken through the initial resistance. If not, that\'s okay too - you still did something productive.\\n\\nFor the lying habit, try replacing it with a simple \\"I\'ll get back to you on that\\" when asked about plans or progress. This gives you space to think and respond truthfully without the pressure of an immediate answer. The key is breaking the reflexive response pattern.\\n\\nRegarding the agoraphobia and anxiety around appointments - start by making one important call or handling one piece of bureaucracy first thing in the morning, before your brain has time to build up resistance. Morning tends to be when our willpower is strongest.\\n\\nThe emotional dampening and autopilot behavior you described often comes from being overwhelmed. Try keeping a simple done list (not a to-do list) where you write down what you actually accomplished each day, even tiny things. This creates awareness of your patterns and gives you small wins to build on.\\n\\nRemember: you don\'t need to fix everything at once. Pick ONE of these suggestions to try for a week. Track how it goes. Then either adjust or add another small change. The goal isn\'t perfection - it\'s progress.","llama_comment":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you\'re facing, so kudos to you for taking this first step. It\'s clear that you have a good understanding of your situation and what needs to change, but as you said, the application and methods are where you\'re getting stuck. \\n\\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building one habit at a time. You mentioned that you\'re able to get yourself to the gym regularly, which is a great example of discipline in action. Could you try to apply some of the same strategies that work for you with exercise to other areas of your life? For instance, you might start by committing to a tiny, daily task related to one of your problem areas, like making a phone call or working on a project for just 10 minutes a day.\\n\\nIt\'s also interesting that you mention lying as a way to avoid discomfort or explanation. This might be worth exploring further, as it could be related to some deeper issues with self-compassion or fear of judgment. Practicing honesty with yourself and others, even in small ways, could help build trust and reduce the need for avoidance behaviors.\\n\\nLastly, since you can\'t seek psychiatric help right now, you might look into online resources like therapy apps, podcasts, or YouTube channels focused on productivity, anxiety, and personal development. These can provide some guidance and support while you\'re waiting for more formal help.\\n\\nRemember that developing discipline and changing habits takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You don\'t have to tackle everything at once, and it\'s okay to take things one step at a time. What do you think might be the smallest, most manageable change you could make this week to get started?","gemini_comment":"Okay, I read your whole post. It sounds like you\'re in a tough spot, but the fact that you\'re self-aware enough to analyze all this is a huge first step. Don\'t beat yourself up too much \u2013 you\'re clearly capable of change, as you mentioned with the gym.\\n\\nSince you\'re feeling overwhelmed, let\'s focus on one small win to start. Forget the big picture for now. Pick *one* thing you\'ve been procrastinating on \u2013 something small, like making a single phone call or sending one email. Commit to doing *just that one thing* tomorrow morning. Don\'t think about anything else on your to-do list. Just that one task.\\n\\nTo combat the autopilot avoidance, try this: set an alarm on your phone for a specific time tomorrow morning (say, 9:00 AM). When it goes off, immediately do that one task. No excuses, no \\"just five more minutes\\" \u2013 just do it. The key is to break the cycle of avoidance *before* it starts.\\n\\nRegarding the lying, maybe try a little experiment. For one day, just focus on telling the truth, even if it\'s uncomfortable. You don\'t have to over-explain, just be honest about what you\'re doing and how you\'re feeling. See how it goes. It might feel weird at first, but it could also be liberating.\\n\\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You\'re not going to fix everything overnight. It\'s about making small, consistent changes over time. Celebrate those small wins, and don\'t get discouraged by setbacks. You got this.\\n"}},{"id":"t3_w1n869","title":"[Need advice] was doing great and now I\'m depressed","body":"\\n\\nWas doing pretty well, started going to the gym and studied a bit.But then my hair started falling out in huge amounts :( , I\'m losing so much hair and everyone pointing out that my hair is everywhere is getting me even more anxious and depressed.How to push through unforseen circumstances which drag you into slumps like this.","comments":{"best_comment":"It wasn\'t your fault.

Good luck!","gpt_comment":"I\'m really sorry to hear you\'re going through this. It sounds tough, but it\'s great that you\'re reaching out for advice. When unexpected challenges like this come up, it\'s important to focus on what you can control. First, consider seeing a doctor or dermatologist about your hair loss to get some professional advice. It might help ease your anxiety to know what\'s going on and what you can do about it. In terms of discipline, try to maintain the habits you were building, even if it\'s at a reduced level. Going to the gym and studying, even in smaller amounts, can help maintain a sense of normalcy and control. Also, remember to be kind to yourself. It\'s okay to have setbacks, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as physical health. Keep pushing forward, and don\'t hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or professionals if you need it. You\'ve got this!","claude_comment":"Hair loss can definitely feel overwhelming, but don\'t let it derail the great progress you\'ve been making with the gym and studying. First, consider seeing a doctor to understand what\'s causing the hair loss - it could be stress, nutrition, hormones, or other treatable factors. While you work on addressing the underlying cause, try to maintain your positive routines since they contribute to your overall wellbeing.\\n\\nWhen facing unexpected setbacks, it helps to focus on what you can control. Keep up with your gym routine - exercise is great for managing stress and anxiety. For the hair situation, you might want to try using a hair catcher in the shower and cleaning up right after brushing to reduce visible hair around you. This can help minimize anxiety-inducing reminders throughout the day.\\n\\nRemember that your worth isn\'t tied to your hair, and the habits you\'re building are making you stronger both physically and mentally. Take it one day at a time, and celebrate the small wins - whether that\'s completing a workout, having a good study session, or simply showing up for yourself despite feeling down. The ability to push through tough times is a skill that gets stronger with practice.","llama_comment":"It\'s really tough when unexpected issues like your hair loss come up and derail your momentum. First, take a step back and acknowledge that it\'s okay to feel overwhelmed - it doesn\'t mean you\'ve failed or that all your progress is lost. When life throws you curveballs, it\'s essential to reassess and adjust your goals temporarily. Consider taking a break from the gym if the stress of people noticing your hair loss is too much, and focus on smaller, manageable tasks like short walks or some light stretching at home. For studying, try breaking it down into even shorter sessions than before, so it feels less daunting. Remember, discipline is not about being perfect; it\'s about being consistent and kind to yourself, especially during difficult times. You might also want to look into ways to manage your hair loss, like talking to a doctor or finding a supportive community online - sometimes tackling the root cause (no pun intended) can help you regain control and confidence. Keep in mind that it\'s a process, and it\'s okay to not be okay right now.","gemini_comment":"Hey, that sounds really rough, and it\'s totally understandable that you\'re feeling down. Hair loss can be a huge hit to your confidence.\\n\\nFirst off, have you seen a doctor about the hair loss? It could be a medical issue that\'s treatable, and getting that checked out might ease some anxiety.\\n\\nAs for pushing through the slump, try to focus on what you *can* control. You were going to the gym and studying \u2013 those are great habits! Even if you can\'t do them at the same intensity right now, try to maintain them in some form. Maybe shorter workouts or just reviewing notes for a bit. The key is to keep the momentum going, even if it\'s slow.\\n\\nAlso, consider breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of \\"study a bit,\\" try \\"read one chapter.\\" Instead of \\"go to the gym,\\" try \\"walk for 20 minutes.\\" Small wins can build you back up.\\n\\nFinally, ignore the comments about your hair as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know, but remind yourself that their comments say more about them than about you. Focus on taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally.

Especially love point #2 about doing things the proper easy way - we often overcomplicate things trying to be \\"perfect\\" when simple solutions work great.\\n\\nYour point about starting small with habits is key. The best approach is usually to break things down into tiny, manageable steps. Want to exercise more? Start with 5 minutes. Want to read? Begin with one page per day.
