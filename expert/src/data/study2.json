      "body": "I really feel like a complete failure. I Can’t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I’m not as productive as I’d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I’m just so disappointed in my self. It’s hard to drink water. I’m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I’m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I’m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I’m just mad at life. I’m not depressed I’m just disappointed. \n\nI’m a ball full of energy. I’m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I’m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I’m a caffeine addict. I don’t know how I will function without my meds when I’m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven’t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don’t wanna do. I’m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don’t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can’t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I’m\nTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.

        "comment_4o": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\n\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\n\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn’t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking. So what’s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain? That’s how my psychiatrist framed it to me, lol.\n\nAlso: “drug holidays” aren’t required, and with BED they can backfire (rebound appetite, lethargy). Worth asking your prescriber about daily dosing, timing, or a different formulation—and to make a pregnancy plan now so you’re not white‑knuckling it later. CBT‑E and/or a dietitian for BED can help a ton.\n\n5‑minute “now” starter:\n- Fill a big water bottle.\n- Set a 5‑minute timer and do the first micro‑move on one task (open the course, press play, or put on shoes).\n\nWhy this helps: tiny first moves drop the activation energy and start momentum. Pair them with If‑Then rules so you don’t have to rely on motivation:\n- If it’s an off‑med day, then I eat a protein+fiber breakfast, do a 10‑minute walk, and one 10‑minute focus block with my phone in another room.\n\nMenu by energy level (pick what fits):\n- Low battery: water bottle + protein/produce each meal + one 10‑minute walk or stretch + one 10‑minute focus block.\n- Medium: 2 x 25/5 focus blocks; body‑double (StudyWithMe/Discord); simple snack prepped (yogurt+fruit, eggs+toast).\n- High: 3 x 25/5 blocks; prep tomorrow’s snacks; 10‑minute tidy.\n\nBinge plan:\n- Eat every 3–4 hours (don’t “earn” food).\n- Pre‑plate snacks; keep trigger foods out of sight/portion them.\n- When an urge hits, set a 10‑minute timer (urge surf) and sip water. If a binge happens, next meal is back on plan—no punishment.\n\nCaffeine: try a cap (e.g., before noon) and pair with food/water to reduce crashes.\n\nTiny feedback loop:\n- Daily 3 boxes: Water? Moved 10 min? One focus block? Check 2/3 = win. Review weekly and adjust one thing.\n\nYou’re not broken—you’re building systems that fit your brain. Use the tools (including meds) and keep the steps small and repeatable.",
        "interv2": "As a fellow Vyvanse taker, be kind to yourself. Using Vyvanse is not a moral failure. Like insulin for diabetes, it treats a real condition. It is also fine to build skills for off days. Try a 5-minute timer to start one tiny task. Have you asked your prescriber whether the two-day breaks are necessary? Only your prescriber can guide med changes."

      "body": "I don't really have any friends. I have nojob. The only thing going for me is that I'm not ugliest guy in the world and im in ok shape physically. My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines . At times I feel like I'm crazy cause I can be somewhat miserable on more than one occasion and can't interact very well with other people. People are fed up for good reason. I dont have a life",

        "comment_4o": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.\n\n3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\n\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to make changes and improve your life. You're not alone in feeling lost, and taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Keep pushing forward!",
        "interv1": "if you're good at physical training and like to help people, learn to be a fitness instructor and help ppl that way — it gives you structure, purpose, and built‑in social contact.\n\n5‑min starter: Google “gyms hiring trainers [your city]” and send 1 email, or DM a local trainer to shadow. Done.\n\nIf money/energy is tight:\n- Get CPR/AED (cheap, 1 day). Many gyms hire floor staff and sponsor certs (ACE/NASM/ISSA).\n- Start small: coach one friend 1:1 for free, or run a free Saturday park workout for 1–3 friends/neighbors. Volunteer at Parkrun.\n- On low days: minimum = a 10‑min walk + text 1 person.\n\nWeekly feedback loop: did I move 3x, help 1 person, and make 1 outreach? If not, shrink the step and try again.\n\nAlso, 31 isn’t late—and if depression/ADHD might be in the mix, a quick chat with a doc/therapist can make this way easier. If you’re in crisis: call/text 988 (US) or your local line.",
        "interv2": "Sorry you are going through this. Feeling lost, depressed, and isolated at 31 is brutal, and getting ghosted stings, but you are not a lost cause.\n\nIf you are good at training and like helping people, consider becoming a fitness instructor or getting a personal trainer license. It gives you structure, purpose, and a built-in community. Helping clients can pull your focus off the spiral in your head and onto making real progress with someone who wants it. You can only help people who want to be helped.\n\nAlso, try talking with a therapist or counselor you feel a connection with to work through the depression, understand yourself better, and start building support beyond your parents. You deserve help while you figure things out."

      "body": "TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?\n\n(30-Age)\nAlright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don’t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very naïve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",

You’re not weak—ADHD/depression/time‑blindness + shame is a brutal combo, and it’s workable with supports.\n\nWhat I did: therapy, really looking at my life, working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof/breathwork, etc. The surprising lever for me was diet—I went zero carb and my mental health improved a lot. That’s just my experience; I’d run any big diet change past your doctor (esp. with meds). You don’t need extreme: a protein‑heavy breakfast, fewer liquid sugars, and more water can steady energy/mood.\n\nIf you want a 5‑minute start today:\n- 3‑minute timer: write 1 bare‑minimum for tomorrow (e.g., take meds, email a therapist, 10‑min walk).\n- 2 minutes now: lay out meds/clothes, fill a water bottle, or do dishes for 2 minutes. Done counts.\n\nADHD‑friendly helps that actually stick:\n- Externalize + time‑box: one capture list; pick ONE task; work 10 minutes; stop. (Less working‑memory load, more momentum.)\n- Body‑doubling: Focusmate/ADHD coworking/Discord; sit with someone and start.\n- Energy tiers: low = shower + eat protein; medium = 10‑min walk; high = full workout.\n\nWhen you miss: shrink, don’t quit. Restart the same day. Measure “did I show up?” not perfection.\n\nTiny feedback loop (2 lines at night): “What helped?” “What got in the way?” + quick energy rating. Adjust tomorrow’s bare‑minimum.\n\nIf you’re in that “focused on being dead” place right now, please reach out to a crisis line or someone IRL. You deserve help.\n\nIn short—have faith, work on yourself, try every day, and keep it tiny. Stack small wins and one day you will wake up closer to who you want to be.",

Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out.

        "comment_4o": "It sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions, and it's great that you're looking to find a way to manage them better. One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps.

Feeling everything so intensely is exhausting—you're not broken. Emotions are data, not directives; the goal is to feel them and still choose your actions.\n\nTiny first step you can try right now (≤2 min): STOP. Stop. Take 3 slow breaths (make the exhale longer than the inhale). Observe and name 1–3 feelings and rate them 0–10. Proceed with the smallest next step you won’t regret tomorrow.

If sitting still is hard, just do 1–3 minutes of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6–8). Longer exhales tell your nervous system to calm down.\n\n4. Decision hygiene for “hot” moments: if your emotion rating is >6/10, wait 24 hours before big decisions. Jot a 2-column list: “What I hope for” vs “What I actually receive.” Pick the next action Future-You will thank you for in 48 hours. Track one thing daily: “Did I pause before acting? (Y/N).” Review weekly for patterns.\n\n5. If this intensity is wrecking sleep/work, or you’re feeling unsafe, please loop in a pro (CBT/DBT skills are great for emotion regulation). If substances are in the mix, or this came on suddenly, a check-in with a doctor can help rule out other stuff.\n\nWhen you miss a step, that’s normal. Aim for B‑minus consistency, not perfection.

It all depends on whether you want to brainstorm how to fix a problem or go back in your past to understand the why so you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control.\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nTake small positive steps and be kind to yourself. Good luck!"

I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. \n\nI have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. \n\nHow can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.\n\nEdit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted.

If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer. If I was in your position, I would start there.",
        "comment_4o": "Hey there, first off, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It sounds incredibly tough, but I want to remind you that you're not alone in this. Many people have felt stuck and found a way forward, and you can too. \n\nLet's start small. It might help to focus on building a routine that gives you a sense of control and accomplishment. Start with something simple, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a new hobby or skill. It doesn't have to be perfect or big, just something that you can stick to and gradually build on.\n\nConsider exploring interests outside of your current job. There are tons of free resources online to learn new skills, whether it's coding, graphic design, or even something like cooking. This could open up new opportunities and help you discover what you enjoy.\n\nAlso, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a game-changer. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation. It's great that you're already on medication, but therapy can offer additional tools to help manage those tough thoughts.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate the little wins and be kind to yourself along the way. You've taken a big step by reaching out here, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and take it one day at a time. You've got this.",
        "interv1": "26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. I’m sorry you’re hurting—when your brain is this heavy, consistency is hard, and that’s not a character flaw.\n\nFirst, safety: if you’re having active thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else, please reach out now. In the US call/text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org; otherwise use your local crisis line or go to the nearest ER. Tell your prescriber how you’re feeling; meds that keep you barely afloat deserve a review. Don’t stop or change meds without them.\n\nFigure out what you want out of life and work backwards. It doesn’t have to be huge—“live comfortably,” “travel,” “buy a house,” “have close friendships,” etc. Life is short, but it’s longer than you think. The lever most people can pull (besides luck) is consistency—but design it to be tiny and doable.\n\n5‑minute starter (pick one):\n- Text someone: “I’m not doing well. Can we talk this week?”\n- Open Notes and write a 90‑day goal + the smallest daily action (2–5 minutes). Set a reminder.\n\nMake it stick:\n- Pick one area (health, money/career, or relationships).\n- Set a “minimum” for bad days and a “standard” for normal days (e.g., minimum = 5‑minute walk or 5 minutes on applications; standard = 25 minutes).\n- Use a timer. Show up > intensity. “Never miss twice.”\n- Weekly 10‑minute check‑in: Did I show up? What got in the way? Adjust the plan, not your worth.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks. If it’s “get a good job,” pick a skill you can self‑teach and commit to a small daily block plus the job search. If it’s “meet people,” do one rep a day (say hi, message one person, one social rep). Small wins build momentum and your brain starts to expect progress.\n\nCareer ideas:\n- Front‑end JS dev is learnable and has tons of free resources—build small projects and a portfolio, apply widely.\n- With your journalism degree, also look at technical writing/UX writing/documentation, grant writing, content marketing, or customer support → internal comms. Start a tiny portfolio (2–3 sample guides or doc rewrites).\n- Reduce pressure where possible (e.g., get on income‑driven repayment for loans if you’re in the US).\n\nIn 3 years your life can be unrecognizable. You could be thirty, in a happier place, with work you like. The gap between that you and today is the little bit you do—consistently—most days between now and then.",

It does not have to be huge. It could be travel, buy a house, build a comfortable life, or get married and raise a family. Pick one thing and make it the target.\n\nHere is a simple plan to start\n\n- Mental health first. Tell a professional how you feel today. If you have a therapist or prescriber, call or message them and be direct about the suicidal thoughts. If you do not, look up low cost counseling or community clinics and book one intake. Go at your own pace and be kind to yourself.\n\n- Ease money stress. Call your loan servicer and ask about income driven repayment, deferment, or hardship forbearance. A nonprofit credit counselor can walk you through options for free.\n\n- Build a path you can stick with. Break the big goal into tiny daily actions and commit to them. If you want a self taught route, front end web development is one option with many free resources, but it does not have to be coding. Set a 10 minute timer today and just begin.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching a goal may only take a couple years if you really stick to it, then you can move on to the next thing.

Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to feel a bit lost. Here are a few ideas to help you get started on your journey:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small, manageable goals that can help build your confidence. It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.\n\n2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields. This could open up new job opportunities and help you feel more accomplished.\n\n3. **Networking**: Since you're shy, try online communities related to your interests. They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.\n\n4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can help build your self-worth and motivate you to keep going.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Ask yourself what your daily life would be if you were satisfied, and mirror those actions until they become habit.\n\nTiny starter (≤5 minutes, do this now):\n- Open a note and finish: “A satisfying day for me would include…”\n- Pick one item and do the 2‑minute version today. That’s your brick.\n\nA few small, tailored bricks:\n- Career (you do have skills: scheduling, calendars, vendors, docs, customer service): spend 5 minutes scanning “project coordinator/operations assistant/executive assistant/museum or gallery admin” postings. Copy one recurring skill into your resume or a “to‑learn” list. Use free learning via your library (LinkedIn Learning), YouTube, or your city’s workforce center.\n- Friends: arrive 5 minutes early to dance and say, “Hey, I’m new—how long have you been coming?” After class: “I had fun—see you next week?” One friendly touch per class is enough.\n\nWhy this works: small wins teach your brain “I’m a person who moves,” which builds motivation and identity. Action creates momentum.\n\nWhen you miss a day (you will): shrink the brick, pair it with an existing habit (after coffee, do 2 minutes), and use “never miss twice” instead of all‑or‑nothing.\n\nFeedback loop: track 1–3 bricks/day in a note. Do a 10‑minute Sunday check to pick next week’s bricks.\n\nAlso, if the low self‑worth feels heavy or persistent, consider a counselor (sliding‑scale/community clinics).

Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad.

Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit?

When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. \n\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks.

I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self‑anger from messing up just leads to more depression.

Missing a day isn’t failure, it’s data. If I miss, I just do the floor the next day. “Never miss twice” helps, but compassion first.\n\n5‑minute start tonight: write your floors on a sticky note, lay out workout clothes, pick one store and a one‑line script (“Hi, where are the batteries?”), and set a reminder for the time you’re most likely to do it. On low days, do just one floor and call it a win.\n\nThings that helped me stick with it:\n- Habit trackers: Loop (Android), Streaks/Done (iOS), or Habitica if you like gamified.\n- Timers: Insight Timer for 1‑minute meditations; Pomodoro/Forest for focus.\n- Body‑doubling/accountability: Focusmate or Study Together Discords.\n- Weekly 5‑minute check‑in: mood 1–10, what helped, one tweak for next week.\n\nTo get around people, I try to break away from my daily routine and go see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local third place a few times a week—cafe, library, climbing gym, or a bar at a quieter time. I’ll often order water/coffee and sit; staff or regulars eventually recognize you and it gets easier.

Define a tiny deliverable a real person can use (e.g., a simple A/B test for one product, a 3–5 min explainer that helps someone choose a supplement, a small consumer insight + fix you actually implement).\n- Run a 4‑week “small bet”: 3 x 25‑min focus blocks per week. Goal: ship one thing and ask 3 people for feedback.\n- Energy menu:\n  - Low: 10 min learning + 5‑sentence summary.\n  - Medium: run one micro‑experiment or draft the tiny deliverable.\n  - High: ship it and collect feedback.\n- When the “dry hole” hits: use the 10‑minute rule, cut the task in half, or switch to the smallest next step (one email, one prototype, one edit).\n- Feedback loop (15 min each Friday): What did I ship? What felt energizing? What did someone thank me for? Keep a one‑line log. Keep what earns thank‑yous; drop what doesn’t.\n- Optional: document‑as‑you‑build (honest, useful notes/shorts). That scratches the “connect with people” itch without needing it to be The Passion yet.\n\nSide note: if that empty/heavy feeling sticks most days for 2+ weeks or messes with sleep/appetite, consider a quick screening (PHQ‑9/GAD‑7) or talking to a pro. No shame—sometimes it’s fuel, sometimes it’s a flag.\n\nNewport’s framing + small bets will let you test physical sciences, econ, or self‑help content in tiny, honest, impact‑oriented ways—exactly the conditions where passion tends to grow.",

She wanted us to stay \"friends,\" but I said no. Even if it hurt me so fucking bad. The thing is that I felt safe during her. I showed too much emotion. I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore.

Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal. It could be as basic as a daily walk or a short workout routine. Exercise is a powerful way to boost your mood and build resilience.\n\nRemember, it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable.

        "comment_4o": "Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\n\nSince you’re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nRemember, it’s all about finding a balance that works for you.

Skip rotis on weekdays and do rice to cut time.\n- Make one onion‑tomato masala base on the weekend; freeze in cubes. Drop a cube = curry in minutes.\n- Set defaults: pick 2 breakfasts + 2 dinners and just rotate this week (e.g., oats/eggs; poha; dal‑chawal + sabzi; veg pulao + raita).

Slips happen—just reset your setup and keep going.\n\nIf this is still wrecking sleep/mood/work, consider chatting with a therapist/doctor (ADHD/anxiety can play a role).",

If possible, switch it off during focus blocks.\n\nWhen it is within reach, set a simple rule like no unlocking until your next break. If you need a break, do something off screen instead. I take a quick stretch or get a glass of water. If you can, delete the social apps from your phone.\n\nTrack a baseline so you can see progress. A quick screen time check or short log helps."

Here are a few tips that might help you get a handle on it:\n\n1. **Awareness**: Start by tracking your spending. Use an app or a simple notebook to jot down every purchase. This will help you see patterns and understand where your money is going.\n\n2. **Budgeting**: Set a budget for yourself. Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each month. Once you hit that limit, try to hold off on more purchases.\n\n3. **Delay Gratification**: When you feel the urge to buy something, wait 24 hours before making the purchase. This can help you determine if you really need it or if it's just an impulse buy.\n\n4. **Find Alternatives**: Since shopping is a way to cope with negative feelings, try to find other activities that make you feel good. This could be exercising, reading, or even just going for a walk.\n\n5. **Set Goals**: Think about what you want to save for. Having a clear goal can make it easier to resist unnecessary purchases because you know your money is going towards something important.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection.

When the urge hits because you’re sad/mad, set a 10‑minute timer and do a cheap mood swap (walk, shower, call a friend); then decide. Give yourself a small weekly “fun” envelope and auto‑move a bit to savings on payday so not‑buying shows up somewhere. If you slip, no shame—log it, note the trigger, and tweak the plan. You can do a No buy month for non‑essentials, or start smaller with no‑spend weekdays or freezing one category. Keep score by tracking “money saved by not buying” at the top of your list and transfer that to savings monthly.

That's called the present bias. The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the \"pain\" associated with those.\n\nFor bad habits, discipline helps, but design works better:\n\n- Map the roots: when/where do you smoke, order food, or spend? Note the emotion/context (tired after work, bored, anxious, knee hurting).\n- Swap the action: smoking/eating signal “I’m safe.” You can get a similar signal from chewing gum, tea, crunchy veg, hot shower, or a quick call/text to someone. Keep the alternative where the habit happens.\n- Add friction to the old, remove friction from the new: move Uber Eats off your home screen, log out, and delete saved cards; keep cigs out of sight; keep ready-to-eat decent food visible (eggs, yogurt, soup, frozen veg).\n\nTiny step right now (≤5 min): log out of Uber Eats and delete the saved payment; put a pack of gum where you usually decide to order. Drink a glass of water and try to sleep.\n\nWhen-then plan for urges (handles slip-ups): “When I want to order, then I eat toast/banana and set a 10‑min timer. If I still want it, I can order.” You get a win even if you order.\n\nScale it based on energy:\n- Low: pick up 5 items in your room; delay first cigarette 10 min with gum; 3 minutes of knee-friendly movement (seated leg raises/ankle pumps).\n- Medium: one default cheap meal (eggs + toast/soup + frozen veg); skip morning Uber once by leaving 15 min earlier; 10‑min tidy.\n- High: plan 2–3 simple meals; book a GP/physio for your knee and a quit‑smoking chat; set a tiny auto-transfer after payday.\n\nSpending/gaming laptop: use a 72‑hour rule for big buys. If after 72 hours (and a quick budget check) you still want it, decide then.\n\nTrack one number for a week: count “reps” of better choices (delays, swaps, skipped orders). Do a 10‑min weekly check-in: what helped, what didn’t, one tweak for next week.\n\nIf thoughts about dying start feeling heavy, sleep stays wrecked, or you feel stuck, loop in a pro (GP can screen for depression/anxiety/ADHD, help with pain, smoking, and eating support).

        "interv1": "Totally normal—lots of people feel a post‑lunch dip. Quick why: food intake (especially fast carbs) bumps blood sugar (transient hyperglycemia); insulin brings it down; that swing can suppress orexin (an alertness signal). There’s also a built‑in circadian lull around 1–3 pm that big/high‑carb meals amplify.\n\nHow to manage it:\n- Keep the carbs but reduce/refine less: smaller servings, more protein/fiber/fat. Eat protein/veg first, carbs last.\n- Move and get light right after eating: 5–10 min brisk walk or light chores standing. Muscles soak up glucose and bright light boosts alertness.\n- Hydrate: a glass of water with/after lunch.\n- Keep bed out of the loop: eat/study away from the bedroom; set a 20–30 min “no bed” window after lunch. If‑then: “If lunch ends, then shoes on + 5‑minute walk.”\n- If you nap, make it a 10–20 min power nap (alarm), ideally not in bed.\n- Caffeine timing: a small coffee/tea right after lunch can help; cut off mid‑afternoon if it hurts sleep.\n\nI skip lunch entirely and have breakfast and an early dinner—works for me, but it’s not for everyone. If you try delaying/skipping, do it only if you feel fine; don’t push through dizziness, and avoid if you have diabetes, a history of disordered eating, or medical guidance to eat regularly.\n\n5‑minute starter today: after lunch, drink a full glass of water and walk outside for 5 minutes before sitting down.\n\nTiny experiment/feedback: for 3 days, try (A) your usual lunch, (B) lower‑carb/higher‑protein, (C) same calories split into two smaller meals 2–3 hours apart. Rate your sleepiness 1–10 one hour after. Keep what drops it by ≥2 points.\n\nIf this is new/severe, you snore/wake unrefreshed, or you’re on meds that cause daytime sleepiness or rebound (antihistamines, some psych meds/stimulants), check with a clinician—iron/B12/thyroid/glucose issues and sleep apnea can worsen the dip.",

      "title": "[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.",
      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

        "comment_4o": "Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss—that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",
        "interv1": "PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS — and a lot of self-awareness in there. Honestly you’re probably better off than you think if you see the problems. Most people aren’t very self aware. Just put one foot in front of the other and don’t give up even when you have the inevitable setback or relapse.\n\n5‑minute move right now: set a 3‑minute timer and write “Today’s 3” on a sticky: 1) body: drink water + 5‑min walk, 2) money/skill: 10 minutes on one task (job app/learning), 3) connection: text one person. Do the first one immediately and put the sticky where you’ll see it.\n\nWhy it works: tiny, visible wins retrain your brain from short dopamine loops (games/booze/scroll) to longer‑term rewards; clarity beats willpower.\n\nMake it fit your energy:\n- Low day: water, 5‑min walk, 10‑min task, one text.\n- Medium: 20‑min focused block, simple meal, 10‑min tidy.\n- High: 45‑min study/apply, workout, call/meet a friend.\n\nIf you slip: do a quick reset ritual (shower, glass of water, 5‑min tidy), then restart Today’s 3. No punishment, just resume.\n\nReduce friction to old habits: uninstall/restrict the worst time‑sink games, move gear out of the bedroom, or keep gaming as a reward after Today’s 3. If an urge hits early, set a 10‑minute timer and do the first task before deciding.\n\nBe present fast: 30‑second box breathing (4‑4‑4‑4) + name 3 things you see, 2 you feel, 1 you hear. When listening: ask 2 questions before giving opinions, then summarize in one sentence (“So what I heard is…”).\n\nExternalize memory: one notebook/notes app. Daily 2‑minute brain‑dump, pick Today’s 3, and save any “good perspective” notes to re‑read each morning.\n\nFeedback loop: at night, score 0–3 (did you hit body/money/connection?). Sunday: glance at the week and tweak.\n\nSafety note: given depression, alcohol use, and the weight‑loss method you mentioned (fasting + drinking), please loop in a doctor/therapist or a free clinic, and consider screening for ADHD. Not medical advice—just care.\n\nYou’re not behind—you’re getting organized. Keep the next step tiny and visible.",
        "interv2": "Your honesty puts you ahead because many people never do. Own your choices, cut back escapes like gaming, and put one foot in front of the other without giving up when you have a setback or relapse. For a concrete start, set a 5 minute timer and do one task today."

        "comment_4o": "Absolutely, a 37-year-old can change his life! It's great that you're ready to try. Start by focusing on small, manageable steps. With $1.25, consider buying ingredients like rice, beans, or oats, which are filling and nutritious. For long-term change, look into local food banks or community resources that might offer support. Building discipline starts with setting small, achievable goals. Try to establish a daily routine, even if it's just waking up at the same time each day or dedicating 10 minutes to a new skill or job search. Remember, change is a gradual process, and every small step counts. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "interv1": "Some people only live to 50 years old.\n\nBut what if you live to 87? You could live as if today is your first day.\n\nThat's something I tell myself when I get overwhelmed with decisions I've made or my circumstances.\n\nFirst, eat today so your brain can plan.\n- In the US: dial 211 right now (2 minutes) and say, “I need a free meal/food pantry today.” They’ll give you nearby times/addresses. If not in the US, search “food bank/soup kitchen near me.”\n- If calling is hard: go to findhelp.org (library Wi‑Fi works), enter your ZIP > Food > Free Meals/Groceries. Also try “community fridge [your city].”\n- With $1.25, grab the cheapest calories you can (banana/ramen/tortillas) and ask a grocery/bakery for day‑old bread—people say yes more than you think. If a place is closed, try the next on the list.\n\nLike others have said here, connect with social services, reach out to friends and family for help, be genuinely thankful for any generosity you receive to those who share it with you.\n\nNext 48 hours:\n- Apply for SNAP (search “SNAP [your state]”). If you have little/no money, ask for expedited benefits (often within 7 days).\n- Ask 211 for your local workforce center/Goodwill, temp/day‑labor offices—quickest path to same‑week income.\n\nTiny system: each night write 1 thing you did and 1 next step. One small win a day compounds, and if a plan falls through, you already have the next option.\n\nYou can find a job, find purpose and be a blessing to others. It's certainly not too late!! You can look back one day on this time and thank the 37 year old you for making some good decisions. One day at a time, and try to find inner peace along the journey. You got this!!\n\nIf you’re feeling like you might hurt yourself, call/text 988 (US) anytime. You don’t have to carry this alone.",
        "interv2": "When I get overwhelmed by decisions I have made or my circumstances, I treat today as day one.\n\nLike others have said here, connect with social services and reach out to friends and family for help, and be genuinely thankful to those who share it with you. Ask clearly for what you need right now. Today, look up the nearest food bank and go during their next open hours.\n\nYou can find a job, find purpose and be a blessing to others.

        "comment_4o": "Hey there! It’s awesome that you’re looking to make the most of your summer. Since you’re already working out and doing chores, you’ve got a good start. Here are a few ideas to fill your day with more activities:\n\n1. **Learn Something New**: Pick up a new skill or hobby. You could try learning a musical instrument, coding, drawing, or even cooking. There are tons of free resources online to get you started.\n\n2. **Set Small Goals**: Try setting daily or weekly goals for yourself. It could be reading a book, writing a short story, or completing a puzzle. Having something to work towards can give your day more structure.\n\n3. **Volunteer**: Look for local volunteer opportunities. It’s a great way to meet new people, gain experience, and make a positive impact in your community.\n\n4. **Explore Nature**: If you can, spend some time outdoors. Go for a walk, hike, or bike ride. It’s a great way to clear your mind and get some fresh air.\n\n5. **Create a Routine**: Even if you don’t have a lot of responsibilities, having a routine can help you feel more productive. Try waking up at the same time each day and planning out your activities.\n\nRemember, it’s all about experimenting and finding what you enjoy. Good luck, and have fun exploring new things!",
        "interv1": "Totally normal to feel aimless on summer break—you’re not doing anything wrong.\n\nQuick starter: before opening YouTube, do a 5‑minute “first block.” Drink water, step outside for sunlight, then 5 minutes of any hobby. Set a timer. If you keep going, great; if not, you still win.\n\nMaybe try to add a couple hobbies to spend 30–60min every day on (or just 5–15 on low‑energy days). Read a book. Maybe learn the guitar or keyboard or another language (free apps/tutorials). Take a bike ride or run/walk every day. Try woodworking or building things. Offer yard or car washing services in your area to make some $. Also easy/free: drawing, simple cooking, journaling, library trips, volunteering. Just some ideas :)\n\nWhy this helps: tiny, predictable starts kill decision fatigue and build momentum.\n\nMake it easier:\n- Pair it with “after breakfast, before screens” and use a simple rule: YouTube after 1 block.\n- Lay out what you’ll do the night before.\n- If you miss a day, just restart; 5 minutes still counts.\n- Keep a note with 1–3 daily checkmarks; each week keep what was fun and swap the rest.\n\nIf you’re feeling down most days or struggling to get out of bed regularly, let a parent/coach/counselor know.",
        "interv2": "Try a couple hobbies for 30 to 60 minutes daily, and go longer if you want. What do you watch on YouTube, and could you try doing it? Read at your local library. Learn an instrument or a language with free apps or videos. Bike, walk, run, or build something. Offer yard or car washing for money. Cut screen time."
