      "body": "I really feel like a complete failure. I Can\u2019t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I\u2019m not as productive as I\u2019d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I\u2019m just so disappointed in my self. It\u2019s hard to drink water. I\u2019m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I\u2019m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I\u2019m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I\u2019m just mad at life. I\u2019m not depressed I\u2019m just disappointed. \n\nI\u2019m a ball full of energy. I\u2019m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I\u2019m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I\u2019m a caffeine addict. I don\u2019t know how I will function without my meds when I\u2019m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven\u2019t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don\u2019t wanna do. I\u2019m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don\u2019t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can\u2019t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I\u2019m\nTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what's wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\n\nThat's how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\n\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\n\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "Sometimes it helps to simplify and tackle one thing at a time, so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. Try making your routine super basic but consistent: schedule a set bedtime and wake-up time, plan small, reasonable meals or snack times, and keep water close by so you actually remember to drink it. On your non-med days, aim for a short, low-pressure workout\u2014like a 10-minute walk or yoga session\u2014just to keep the momentum. With binge eating, don\u2019t label yourself as \u201cfailing\u201d if you slip up; practice resetting right after rather than waiting until the next day. Even a simple shift like putting your phone in another room while you study or work can help you stay focused. Let yourself build discipline gradually by proving you can stick to tiny, not-too-hard promises each day. Whenever you start feeling discouraged, remind yourself why you\u2019re doing it\u2014your future family, your goals, and your own well-being\u2014and keep stepping forward, even if it\u2019s just an inch at a time."

No Tik Tok, no Instagram, no Facebook- nothing that will allow me to mindlessly scroll. It has actually caused me to pick up a book and read. \n2. When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself \u201cWhat is something small I can do right now?\u201d. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I\u2019m not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in 1 go, but I have at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something. \n3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud \u201cDon\u2019t put it down- put it away.\u201d This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. \n\nMaybe these will help you move forward. It\u2019s a small start.\n\nAlso, the book Atomic Habits is slowly but surely changing my life and making even these tiny gains happen. I recommend running to get it. Before I started to read it, I wondered if maybe I was depressed. And truthfully, maybe I still am. But this book is helping me realize that it is not a lack of goals or motivation that is my problem, it is a lack of good systems in my life.

The key is to build momentum with small wins.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time. Use a planner or an app to keep track of your tasks and prioritize them.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and leisure. Consistency is crucial in building discipline.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process.\n\nThis subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes.

        "o1_comment": "I\u2019ve found that it really helps to start with just one small, clear task and commit to finishing it no matter how trivial it seems. Trying to do everything at once can freeze you in place, so scale down your plan until you feel you can handle it today. When you consistently knock out little tasks, you build a quiet confidence and momentum that makes the bigger stuff less intimidating. It\u2019s not about a personality overhaul overnight, but rather about showing up for yourself each day, even in a small way. And yes, this is definitely the right place to post\u2014people here get the struggle and have lots of good tips and support to share. Keep going and try not to let the guilt take over; focus on making each small win part of your new routine."

My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines .

        "o1_comment": "It\u2019s never too late to start making changes. A simple approach is to treat fitness as your anchor habit and build from there: keep a consistent workout schedule and add one new small routine every couple of weeks\u2014something like waking up at the same time daily, dedicating 30 minutes to job searches or skill-building, or reaching out to someone new each week. This way, you\u2019ll create momentum in multiple areas of your life.

Don\u2019t worry too much about \u201cfeeling old\u201d; there\u2019s no set timeline for figuring out your path.

For the 5am workout habit, since you're already up at that time, maybe try setting up your workout gear the night before so it's the first thing you see in the morning. You could also schedule your workout like an important meeting, blocking that time off just for exercise.

      "body": "\nI am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it\u2019s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it\u2019s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work.

        "gpt_comment": "Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\n\nSince you\u2019re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about finding a balance that works for you. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "Meal-prepping on the weekend can be a huge timesaver. If you can spend a couple of hours chopping veggies, mixing basic sauces, and maybe marinating proteins, you\u2019ll be able to throw meals together more quickly on weekdays. Cooking in batches (like making a big pot of dal or curry and freezing half) also helps so you\u2019re not starting from scratch each evening. It might help to set a fixed weekly grocery shopping time and keep a running list so you\u2019re not constantly worrying about what to buy. As for cleaning, try a quick 10-minute tidy routine each day so it doesn\u2019t build up. You could also consider having a maid come in just once a week for a deeper clean, so the day-to-day upkeep is lighter. For squeezing in workouts, keep it manageable: even a 15-minute routine in the morning or evening can make a difference. Over time, you\u2019ll get into a flow and feel less stressed juggling it all."

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First off, remember that it's completely normal to feel pressure and anxiety when something important is on the line. The key is to channel that energy into productive action. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Instead of thinking about the exam as one huge task, break your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. Set daily goals that are achievable and specific. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\n2. **Create a Schedule**: Structure can be your best friend right now. Make a study schedule that includes breaks and stick to it. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus.\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify your biggest distractions and find ways to minimize them. This might mean setting specific times for social media or using apps that block distracting sites while you study.\n\n4. **Visualize Success**: Spend a few minutes each day visualizing yourself succeeding in the exam. This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can be a great stress reliever. Even a short walk or some stretching can clear your mind and improve focus.\n\n6. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to someone who has been through this process or a mentor who can offer guidance and support.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got a month to go, and that's plenty of time to make a difference. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It sounds like fear of failure is paralyzing you more than the exam itself. One way to push through is to focus on consistent, structured study times and accept that some days won\u2019t be perfect. Instead of letting the pressure build until you collapse, set a realistic schedule in smaller chunks: commit to studying for a set time, then allow yourself a short break to decompress, and repeat. It helps to physically remove distractions\u2014close tabs, turn off your phone, or move to a different room\u2014so you don\u2019t rely purely on willpower. If you find yourself drifting off or fantasizing, notice it without beating yourself up, then bring your attention back to the material. Each session completed is a small win that builds momentum, and the more you repeat this pattern, the more you\u2019ll see you can handle the pressure. Feeling anxious about a huge goal is normal, but you can chip away at that anxiety by doing something productive right now, even if it\u2019s just 20 minutes of focused study. Over time, those 20-minute blocks add up and help you realize that failure isn\u2019t the story here\u2014taking action is."

      "body": "Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \"I didn't have much more to say\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\n\n**Two minors issues**\n\n* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \n \n\n**My two biggest issues**\n\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\" and the thought really really scares me.  \n \n* **Dating** \\--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \n \n\n**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, kudos for reaching out and being open about what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Let's break this down a bit.\n\nFor your body image and gym routine, it's great that you're already making strides. The key to maintaining it is to find a routine that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing long-term. Maybe mix it up with activities you like, whether it's a sport, hiking, or even dancing. Consistency is more sustainable when it's fun.\n\nCutting down on alcohol is a solid move, especially since you've noticed it affects your decisions. Try setting clear boundaries for yourself, like limiting drinks to certain occasions or opting for non-alcoholic alternatives when socializing. It\u2019s all about finding a balance that works for you.\n\nRegarding NoFap, remember that it's okay to take small steps. Instead of thinking about never doing it again, focus on reducing the frequency gradually. Celebrate small victories, like going a few days without it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. It's a journey, not a sprint.\n\nAs for dating, it's perfectly okay to take a break and focus on yourself, especially with all the changes coming up. Building a strong relationship with yourself can make future relationships more fulfilling. If you're worried about loneliness, try deepening connections with friends or exploring new hobbies that bring you joy and community.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right path by identifying what you want to change. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to remember that sustainable change usually comes from steady, realistic habits rather than big all-or-nothing decisions. For the fitness goal, aim for a routine you can keep up even on busy days, like shorter gym sessions or quick workouts at home\u2014something that fits your lifestyle instead of taking it over. That way, once you reach your goal, you won\u2019t be tempted to give it up completely. The same goes for cutting back on alcohol: moderation can be a good step if quitting outright feels too big right now. Little by little, you build momentum.\n\nFor the porn issue, consider focusing on one day at a time rather than worrying about never doing it again. It can feel overwhelming to think in absolutes. You might try filling the times you\u2019d normally slip up with small alternatives, like a quick walk or journaling. Distraction and mindful awareness of triggers go a long way. If you find yourself relapsing, try not to beat yourself up\u2014just reset and keep going.\n\nYour questions about dating sound totally normal, especially when life is in flux. If you\u2019re feeling burnt out by the whole process, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a break and putting that energy toward yourself. Sometimes stepping away to invest in your goals, self-confidence, and well-being makes future connections healthier and less stressful. You\u2019re not missing out if you\u2019re using that time to grow. The key is prioritizing your own stability and happiness first, so when you do date, you\u2019re doing it from a place of strength and clarity. Good luck\u2014take it one day at a time."

I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\n\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don\u2019t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked.

If you slip, don\u2019t beat yourself up; instead, try to understand what triggered it and move on. Replacing porn with a healthier habit\u2014like going for a walk, calling a friend, or even jotting down your goals\u2014can slowly weaken its hold.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to shake things up and push past that comfort zone. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Set Clear, Specific Goals**: Instead of vague goals like \"I want to grow,\" try setting specific, measurable goals. For example, \"I want to learn a new skill, like coding, and complete an online course in three months.\" This gives you a clear target to aim for.\n\n2. **Break It Down**: Big goals can be overwhelming, so break them into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Discipline often comes from routine. Set aside specific times each day or week dedicated to working on your goals. Consistency is key.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community with similar interests. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and accountable.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. What's working? What's not? Be open to adjusting your approach if needed.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Don't wait until you've achieved the big goal to celebrate. Acknowledge and reward yourself for the small victories along the way.\n\nRemember, growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, so embrace the discomfort as a sign that you're moving in the right direction. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "Try breaking your bigger goals into small daily or weekly tasks that challenge you just enough to stretch beyond your usual comfort zone. Then, schedule regular check-ins\u2014whether weekly or monthly\u2014to evaluate if you\u2019re making progress or coasting. If you catch yourself stalling, immediately do something that feels slightly intimidating, like tackling the hardest part of a project or learning an unfamiliar skill. Consistent mini-challenges like these build your tolerance for growth and keep complacency at bay. It also helps to share your plans with someone you trust, so you have a little outside encouragement or accountability. Over time, you\u2019ll train yourself to spot and overcome complacency before it sets in."

My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nGood luck!",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don't suppress it, it will just bottle up and that's not good. Writing things helps me see it as it is and not with emotions but with logic and rationale.",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions, and it's great that you're looking to find a way to manage them better. One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to see emotional awareness as a tool rather than something to suppress entirely. Let yourself feel what you\u2019re feeling, but practice giving those emotions a moment to settle before making any decisions. One simple way is to pause and identify exactly what you\u2019re experiencing, then remind yourself of the outcome or goal you\u2019re aiming for. Some people use journaling or a brief daily check-in to sort out what\u2019s driving their choices. It also helps to plan your next move when you\u2019re not in the heat of the moment\u2014like deciding on your response in advance so you\u2019re not purely reacting when an intense emotion comes up. Over time, this approach builds the discipline to acknowledge feelings while staying logically grounded, and it will get easier to choose actions that align with your deeper goals."

Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. \n\nAnother strategy is to set a timer for a short period, like 10 or 15 minutes, and commit to working for just that amount of time. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going. Also, try to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or not be perfect on the first try.

        "o1_comment": "It can help to shrink the task into a small, easy win so the fear feels more manageable. For instance, pick one tiny part of your homework and spend a strict ten minutes on it\u2014no more, no less\u2014just to prove to yourself you can start. Once you realize you survived those ten minutes, you might feel less pressure and keep going. Another technique is to remind yourself that perfection isn\u2019t the immediate goal; getting something on paper is better than nothing at all. Even if it\u2019s not perfect, you can refine it later. Over time, these small successes add up and your brain learns that starting isn\u2019t as scary as it seems. If you keep confronting that fear in manageable doses, you\u2019ll be building a habit of diving in early rather than waiting for deadlines to scare you into action."

If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

WHAT DO I DO?!\n\nYou might be wondering how this happened...well...\n\nI have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \"content\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.\n\nAnother problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.\n\nEven when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\n\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say \"I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships.

It might be tough, but consider having a candid conversation with your dad and the scholarship committee. Explain that you struggled with the transition and are actively working on improving. They might appreciate your honesty and determination to do better.\n\nRegarding your habits, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. Since blockers haven't worked, try changing your environment. If possible, study in a library or a caf\u00e9 where distractions are minimized. Also, set small, achievable goals for each day.

They can offer support and strategies to manage anxiety, which might help you feel more comfortable tackling these conversations and responsibilities.\n\nLastly, about skipping the semester, weigh the pros and cons.

      "body": "After completing 16 solid hours of productive analytical work, instead of hitting the sack, I go into manic scrolling mode.. Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Reddit, becoming increasingly awake and energetic till 2am, effectively ruining my next day. \n\nWhy is this happening ? How can I stop this?\n\nUpdate: Thank you for insightful comments and great recommendations! I am super grateful for the effort that you guys have put in your replies. I\u2019ve learnt new perspectives from every single comment. This is awesome. Thank you once again \ud83e\udd70\n\nTo summarize \n\n1) Go on dopamine fasting. Rewire my brain to get used to lower doses of dopamine hit. Swear off social media\n\n2) Replace downtime with something constructive, that I can grow over time. Be deliberate about what the replacement activities are before going on dopamine fast. Examples of replacement activities are reading, journaling, exercising, learning a new language, trying to make art\u2026\n\n3) Examine what is causing me to get into social media apps, beyond the dopamine factor. Social media is not my support network. Few books mentioned are Wilpower instinct, Atomic habits, Digital Minimization, the Molecule of more \n\n4) Out of sight out of mind. Keep the phone away, set limits on usage, put on grey mode, tell my brain that I am not missing out anything. Love this quote \"If it's not what you want, are you really sacrificing anything by not doing it?\"",

        "best_comment": "It is called Revenge Procrastination. Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I\u2019m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary \u2018A Social Dilemma\u2019. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it\u2019s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere\u2019s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n\u201cEach time you\u2019re swiping down, it\u2019s like a slot machine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. Sometimes it\u2019s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it\u2019s just an ad.\u201d What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the \u2018pull to refresh\u2019 function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline\u2014whether that\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email\u2014we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising \u2018likes\u2019 or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what\u2019s called \u2018ludic loops\u2019\u2014where a user is unsure whether they\u2019ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation\u2014is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.\u201d\n\nLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. \n\nAs always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of needing to unwind after a long day, but the way you're doing it is actually counterproductive. After such intense work, your brain craves a break, and social media offers quick, easy dopamine hits. The problem is, it can become a cycle that disrupts your sleep and productivity. \n\nTo break this habit, try setting a specific time limit for social media use in the evening, maybe 30 minutes, and stick to it. Use apps that can help you enforce these limits. Also, consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve screens\u2014like reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. \n\nRemember, it's about finding balance. You don't have to cut out social media entirely, but being mindful of how and when you use it can make a big difference. Good luck!",

A big part of it is your brain craving quick rewards after a long workday\u2014it\u2019s an effective but unhealthy way to unwind. One trick is planning a calming activity you actually enjoy before bed, like reading or journaling. Keep the phone in another room or enable strict app limits right after you\u2019re done working. It sounds small, but physically separating yourself from your phone makes a huge difference. You might also find it helpful to remind yourself, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t helping me in any real way, am I really losing anything by giving it up?\u201d Consistency is key here, so a couple of nights in a row sticking to your new routine can set a better rhythm and help you crash at a more reasonable time.

Idk why but shopping is just satisfying and I just can\u2019t help it.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with some emotional spending, which is super common. Here are a few tips that might help you get a handle on it:\n\n1. **Awareness**: Start by tracking your spending. Use an app or a simple notebook to jot down every purchase. This will help you see patterns and understand where your money is going.\n\n2. **Budgeting**: Set a budget for yourself. Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each month. Once you hit that limit, try to hold off on more purchases.\n\n3. **Delay Gratification**: When you feel the urge to buy something, wait 24 hours before making the purchase. This can help you determine if you really need it or if it's just an impulse buy.\n\n4. **Find Alternatives**: Since shopping is a way to cope with negative feelings, try to find other activities that make you feel good. This could be exercising, reading, or even just going for a walk.\n\n5. **Set Goals**: Think about what you want to save for. Having a clear goal can make it easier to resist unnecessary purchases because you know your money is going towards something important.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself as you work on building better habits. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "One simple trick is to put a cooling-off period between feeling the urge to buy something and actually purchasing it, even if it\u2019s just 24 hours. Often, that impulse fades once you step away. Another way is to automate your savings so part of your paycheck goes straight to a separate account you don\u2019t touch\u2014out of sight, out of mind. It also helps to remove card details from websites or apps you frequently use; having to enter everything manually makes you think twice. If shopping feels like emotional relief, try to channel that energy into something else you enjoy (like a quick walk, a hobby, or talking with a friend). Over time, the satisfaction of watching your savings grow can become more rewarding than any impulse buy."

It's also helpful to create a schedule or routine that includes time for rest and relaxation. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly, but about making consistent progress.

        "o1_comment": "It helps to accept that doing everything at once simply isn\u2019t possible, so start by picking your top priorities and figuring out how much time you can realistically give to each. You might devote a few focused hours a week to learning piano instead of trying to practice daily. Or you could batch certain tasks\u2014like cooking meals for a few days at once\u2014so you\u2019re not always in the kitchen. Use a basic schedule to block out chunks of time and then commit to following it, even if it\u2019s just one hour of studying, half an hour of practice, and a quick workout. Doing less but doing it consistently will add up over time. It\u2019s less about hitting every ambition at full force every day and more about finding a balanced pace that you can actually sustain. It also helps to recognize that you\u2019ll have seasons of life where you focus more on work or study, and others where you have space to dive into extra pursuits. By being selective and consistent, you\u2019ll get to see progress without burning yourself out trying to juggle everything all at once."

If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested.

The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\n\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.",

Even if they're not in your ideal field, they can help you save up and gain more independence.\n\n2. **Education**: If you can manage it financially and time-wise, continuing with your class is a good idea. Education can open doors, but it doesn't have to be a full-time commitment right now. Maybe look into online courses or certifications that are affordable and can boost your skills.\n\n3. **Budgeting**: Try to track your expenses and see if there are areas where you can save more. Every little bit helps when you're working towards moving out.\n\n4. **Communication with Your Mom**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your mom about your goals and how she can support you in becoming more independent. Maybe there's a way to gradually take on more responsibilities that can help prove your capability.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be where you are.

Look into financial aid or community college programs you can afford; even taking one class at a time can move you toward a degree without racking up huge debt. If working extra hours or finding a better-paying job allows you to save up and move out sooner, it might be worth doing before pursuing a full load of coursework. Write out a plan each month\u2014how much you\u2019ll earn, how much you\u2019ll spend, and how much you\u2019ll save. Small steps might feel slow, but consistency is what gets you off the treadmill.

        "gpt_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing these thoughts and want to change. Here are a few steps that might help you work on this:\n\n1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning more about the cultures and histories of the groups you find yourself judging. Understanding the context and experiences of others can help break down stereotypes.\n\n2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it's based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\n\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\n\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\n\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds. Listening to their stories and perspectives can be eye-opening and help you grow.\n\nRemember, change takes time and effort, but acknowledging the problem is a huge first step. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself as you work through this.",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to start treating these thoughts like any other unhelpful habit you\u2019re trying to break. When you notice yourself making a sweeping judgment, take a quick mental pause and remind yourself that it\u2019s just a reflex, not a fact. Over time, that pause gets easier and longer. You can also commit to reading or watching content that highlights positive, everyday experiences of people from groups you tend to generalize. This naturally broadens your perspective and makes it harder for those stereotypes to stick. Avoid trying to flip a switch overnight \u2014 instead, think of this process as building a small, consistent practice of challenging your assumptions every time they come up. Gradual repetition and correction really do help reshape your mindset in the long run."

If you start missing days, don\u2019t beat yourself up\u2014just return to that small daily commitment. Over time, those short sessions become a habit and help you rediscover your discipline.

I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:\n\n1. Assess my current situation\n2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self\n3. Create SMART goals \n4. Do a daily review of the day\n\n**Assess the situation**.  \nThis is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  \nI started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  \nInfrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  \nThen i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  \nAfter that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\n\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.\n\n**Map out your ideal self**  \nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SMART Goals**  \nWay to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  \nRelevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   \n\n\n**Daily Review**  \nThe hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  \n\n\nSo these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I\u2019m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I\u2019m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that\u2019s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I\u2019m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist.

Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun.

WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example.

Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH).

It also helps to reduce the \u201cweekend is everything\u201d mentality because you\u2019re sprinkling little pockets of satisfaction throughout the week. As for struggling with getting out of bed and using food as a comfort, try focusing on simple, consistent steps: go to bed around the same time, wake up around the same time, and aim for meals you actually enjoy but that don\u2019t keep you feeling sluggish.

        "best_comment": "Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you\u2019re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

I found it hard to clean up because a messy room was a barrier to entry when I was younger (nothing too sinister just a method of protecting my privacy) maybe you have a similar situation.

        "gpt_comment": "I totally get where you're coming from. Tackling unpleasant tasks can feel like a huge mental hurdle. One trick that might help is the \"5-minute rule.\" Tell yourself you'll only work on the task for 5 minutes. Often, just starting is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it's easier to keep going. Also, try to pair the task with something you enjoy, like listening to your favorite music or podcast. This can make the activity feel less daunting. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset and reduce that pull toward inaction. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "I\u2019ve found it helps to give yourself permission to start super small, like committing to just five minutes of cleaning. Once you start, it often feels easier to keep going. Another trick is pairing the task with something mildly enjoyable\u2014listening to a podcast or some music\u2014so it doesn\u2019t feel like pure drudgery. If you keep your sessions short and consistent, you\u2019ll train your mind to see it less as a dreaded chore and more like a quick daily habit. Over time, it feels more natural and that pull toward inaction won\u2019t be as strong."

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really trying to find a balance that works for you, and that's a great start. First off, don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to have fluctuations in motivation and energy. If 3 hours feels overwhelming right now, it's totally okay to scale back a bit. Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. \n\nAlso, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one. It might also help to set specific goals for each session, so you have a clear purpose and can see progress over time.\n\nSince you mentioned that you don't feel the same immediate benefits from work as you do from the gym or eating healthy, try to find ways to make your work more rewarding. Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.\n\nLastly, it's worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn't, it might be why you're struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "You might start by scaling back a bit and then gradually working your way up. Even if three hours feels \u201csmall,\u201d it\u2019s better to lock in a consistent habit than to overextend and burn out. Sometimes breaking work into bite-sized chunks (like 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off) makes it more manageable. If you\u2019re unsure whether you truly care about the business, try finding a short-term goal or small achievement you can get excited about, so you have a clear reason to sit down and work. Discipline often grows from taking these little wins and turning them into a routine, rather than trying to force yourself through hours of work you resent. It may not feel as instantly rewarding as hitting the gym, but getting in a rhythm of consistent effort can still bring a sense of accomplishment once those small victories add up."

Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I\u2019ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it\u2019s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can\u2019t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can\u2019t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don\u2019t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated.

You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It\u2019s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to be ok, and it does get better. \n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can\u2019t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible.

(For the most part.)\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you\u2019re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don\u2019t be rigid.

For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. \n\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through. \n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days.

Having a tracking app can help you see real progress and give you little hits of motivation\u2014Habitica turns goals into a game, and there are others like Strides or Loop if you prefer something simpler. Some folks also like having an accountability partner or posting updates in supportive subreddits for that extra push. Before bed, try writing down one small objective for each of your four tasks the next day, so you wake up with a concrete plan. Over time, the small wins pile up, and the fear that one misstep dooms you will start to fade. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this."

It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\n\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels\u2014there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\n\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\n\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\n\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It\u2019s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\n\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to pick just one thing you can tackle first\u2014like your sleep schedule or cleaning your bedroom\u2014and focus on making consistent, small changes. For example, set an alarm for a reasonable bedtime and power down electronics half an hour before bed. If that\u2019s too big a leap, start moving your bedtime just 10 or 15 minutes earlier each night. Once you see progress in that one area, you\u2019ll build confidence to tackle something else, like setting a short, focused block of study time every day or chipping away at the mess in your room for a set period of time. It\u2019s less about willpower and more about building routines that get you to act without overthinking. If you\u2019re still feeling stuck with ADHD despite medication, keep talking to your doctor or consider trying different tools (timers, reminders, accountability buddies). You\u2019re closer to crossing that finish line than you might think, and small, consistent steps often do more than big bursts of motivation."

Here are a few ideas that might help: \n\n1. **Simplify Your Meals**: Focus on recipes that are quick and easy but still healthy. Think stir-fries, salads, or one-pot meals that take 20-30 minutes max. \n\n2. **Batch Prep Ingredients**: Instead of full meals, prep ingredients twice a week. Chop veggies, marinate proteins, or cook grains in advance. This way, you can mix and match to create fresh meals quickly.\n\n3. **Use a Slow Cooker or Instant Pot**: These can be lifesavers. You can throw everything in before work and come home to a ready meal. Plus, they often make enough for leftovers that don\u2019t feel stale.\n\n4. **Set a Routine**: Try to set a specific time for cooking, like right after work. It might be tough at first, but once it becomes a habit, it\u2019ll feel less like a chore.\n\n5. **Incorporate Breaks**: If screen fatigue is a big issue, take short breaks during the day to rest your eyes. This might help you feel less drained by the evening.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works for you and making small adjustments. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "Have you tried doing partial prep instead of cooking entire meals in advance? You could chop veggies, marinate proteins, or cook grains on a weekend or a weeknight when you have a bit more energy, then all that\u2019s left is the quick part of actually assembling and heating everything. The simpler your recipes, the less overwhelming it\u2019ll feel on a tired night\u2014one-pot meals, stir-fries, or sheet-pan dinners can all be quick wins. If screen fatigue drains you, maybe set up short breaks during work or limit screen time after hours so your eyes and mind get a rest, letting you recharge enough to handle a quick cooking session. Over time, your body and your routine adapt, and it won\u2019t feel like such a big obstacle each evening. Good luck!"

One thing that might help is to focus on building a routine that feels sustainable rather than going all-in right from the start. Try setting smaller, more manageable goals and gradually increase the intensity or duration of your workouts. This way, you're less likely to burn out.\n\nAlso, consider mixing up your workouts to keep things interesting. If you're an early morning person, maybe try different types of exercises that you can look forward to, like a new class or a run in a different location.

        "o1_comment": "I\u2019ve found it helps to ease up on the all-or-nothing mindset. If you\u2019re burning out after a couple weeks, try shorter or lower-intensity workouts on certain days so you\u2019re not going 100% every time. Consistency is easier when you have something you can stick to even on the days you\u2019re not feeling your best. It might also help to set a strict but manageable schedule\u2014like never skipping a planned early-morning session, even if you only do a light 20-minute routine. That way, you\u2019re reinforcing the habit itself instead of relying on momentum and energy spikes. And if a few days off turn into more, remind yourself that even a short session gets you back on track better than waiting for the \u201cperfect\u201d time. The key is showing up, however you can."

Meals high in carbs or sugar can cause a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash, making you feel tired. Try incorporating more protein and healthy fats into your lunch to see if that helps. Also, consider your portion sizes; eating too much can make you feel sluggish. \n\nAnother thing to look at is your overall sleep quality and quantity. If you're not getting enough rest at night, it can make you more prone to afternoon drowsiness. \n\nFinally, try to get some light physical activity after eating, like a short walk.

The good news is that you can definitely work on building mental and physical strength, and it all starts with small, consistent steps.\n\nFor mental discipline, try starting with mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and learn to manage them better. Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal. It could be as basic as a daily walk or a short workout routine. Exercise is a powerful way to boost your mood and build resilience.\n\nRemember, it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable. It's part of being human. The key is learning how to balance them and not let them control you. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "Start by giving yourself a small win each day. If you\u2019re feeling lost, pick a simple habit\u2014like a quick workout or a ten-minute walk\u2014and stick to it no matter what. Showing up for yourself consistently teaches you that you can trust your own resolve. At the same time, work on your mindset by clarifying why you want to change. Write down a few sentences about the person you want to become and revisit it when you feel old patterns creeping in. You don\u2019t have to shut off all emotion; you just want to respond more wisely. Meditation or slow breathing can help you pause instead of reacting. Over time, you\u2019ll see your confidence and self-control grow, especially if you keep tracking progress. Remember, it\u2019s not about never feeling vulnerable again; it\u2019s about proving to yourself day after day that you can handle life\u2019s ups and downs without letting them derail you."

That used to keep my mind active. But now when I fully want to concentrate, without music or anything, I just can't.

        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're making some great strides with your dopamine detox, but the sleepiness is definitely a hurdle. Here are a few things you might try: \n\n1. **Adjust Your Sleep Schedule**: Even though you're getting 6-7 hours, you might need a bit more. Try going to bed earlier and see if that helps. Everyone's sleep needs are different, and sometimes just an extra hour can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Take Short Breaks**: Implement the Pomodoro Technique\u2014work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and prevent that sleepy feeling.\n\n3. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes, feeling sleepy can be a sign of dehydration. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n4. **Natural Light and Fresh Air**: Try to study near a window or take short walks outside. Natural light and fresh air can be invigorating and help keep you alert.\n\n5. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some light exercise into your routine. Even a quick 10-minute workout can boost your energy levels.\n\n6. **Mindful Music**: If music helped you before, consider using instrumental or ambient music that won't distract you but can keep your mind engaged.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works best for you. Keep experimenting with small changes until you find the right balance. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "You might find it helpful to build a structured routine with little energizing breaks. Take a short walk every hour or two, stretch, or do jumping jacks to keep yourself active. You can also experiment with your sleep schedule\u2014try going to bed 30 minutes earlier and see how you feel. If you miss the stimulation of music, you might use soft background sounds (like rain or white noise) instead, so it\u2019s not completely silent. Staying hydrated, getting natural sunlight in the morning, and eating snacks that release energy slowly (like nuts or yogurt) can help too. Finally, remember it may take a bit of time to adjust to the new routine, so keep an eye on how your body responds and tweak as needed. Good luck!"

Here\u2019s a scenario:  \n\nJust suppose you\u2019re walking along a paved highway toward a beautiful horizon.  The sun is setting just right, you feel the warm air and maybe even a gentle breeze.  As you\u2019re walking you notice how far you\u2019ve come, that\u2019s living in the gain.  The opposite is focusing on how much further you have to go or living in the gap between where you are and where you have yet to go.  \n\nWhen we measure success based on how far we\u2019ve come we see what successes we have had up until now.  On the other hand, when we measure success based on how far we have to go we always feel disappointed.  Bc the thing is we can never actually get to the horizon. No matter how far we walk, run, drive.  The horizon isn\u2019t there for us to get to. These are our ideals.  We will never actually measure up to our ideal self (which is usually ego driven).

I advise that you follow these general rules\n1. the 60 second rule: if you catch yourself procrastinating, tell yourself that you will just work for 60 seconds. afterwards, it will be significantly easier for you to continue working.\n\n2. the two minute habit rule: slowly integrate studying and exercise as habits in your life. however, when you start, you may get a surge of motivation and do too much. if you do this, you will burn out. instead, start by doing the habit in under two minutes a day, and build it up from there. instead of trying to do a full workout routine every day, just do 90 seconds worth of push-ups a day.\n\n3. meditate daily: one of the habits you integrate should be mindfulness meditation. it will allow you to recognize when you are procrastinating faster, and it will make it easier for you to resist the procrastination.\n\n4. the two day rule: some days you just won\u2019t do a habit. it happens. maybe something came up, or you just had a bad day. when this happens, just don\u2019t let it happen two days in a row, or the habit will begin to fade.\n\n5. don\u2019t beat yourself up. progress comes slow, and as i mentioned before, this is something everyone experiences.",

The workouts were long and brutal. Four hour pool sessions. \n\nFor repetitions during push-ups, pull ups, burpees, etc knowing that you have 100 burpees ahead of you is daunting and if you think about it too much you will quit. But if you break it down into manageable chunks, you can keep going no matter what. For example when I knew I had 100 I would start knocking them out. Maybe 20 at a time. Then it would get hard so I would only focus on doing 10. Then 5. Then 2. Break things up into manageable chunks!\n\nI apply this to my life in many ways. When I know I have dishes to clean, laundry to do, meals to prep, etc. I pick one, and start with it. Don\u2019t think about the others. Just start! Once you finish one task that sense of accomplishment will build up. And you will move onto the next. \n\nYou got it! You are capable! Good luck \ud83e\udd19",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're struggling with getting started, which is super common. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, if you need to study, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes and focus solely on that. Once the timer goes off, take a short break and then decide if you want to do another round. This technique, often called the Pomodoro Technique, can make tasks feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Also, try to identify the specific distractions that pull you away and find ways to minimize them, like putting your phone in another room or using apps that block distracting websites. Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself and celebrate small wins along the way. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "Sometimes the biggest struggle is just starting. If you find your mind drifting, try setting a tiny goal that\u2019s too small to resist\u2014like studying for just five minutes or doing one set of exercises. Once you\u2019re in motion, it often feels easier to stick with it. Creating a consistent routine, especially if it\u2019s tied to a specific time of day or immediately after a regular event (like breakfast), can also help train your brain to expect \u201cstudy time\u201d or \u201cworkout time.\u201d When motivation wavers, rely on a simple plan or schedule you\u2019ve made ahead of time, so you don\u2019t give yourself room to negotiate. If you slip up, don\u2019t beat yourself up; just come back to the plan the next time. It\u2019s the daily act of showing up\u2014even in small ways\u2014that builds lasting discipline.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to make some changes, which is a great first step. Here\u2019s a simple approach to get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one small habit you want to build. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or spending 5 minutes sketching or writing. The key is consistency, not intensity.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve in both discipline and creativity. Break these down into manageable tasks. For example, if you want to write a book, start with writing 100 words a day.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your new habit at the same time every day. This helps your brain associate that time with the activity, making it easier to stick with it.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, no matter how small. This positive reinforcement can help keep you motivated.\n\n6. **Be Patient and Kind to Yourself**: Change takes time, and setbacks are part of the process. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day\u2014just get back on track the next day.\n\nRemember, building discipline and creativity is a journey, not a sprint.

        "o1_comment": "Discipline is just like any other skill\u2014it grows with consistent practice, not sudden bursts of inspiration. Try starting with a single, manageable habit you can commit to every day, even if it\u2019s just five minutes of writing or a quick walk. Once you prove to yourself that you can stick with something small, it\u2019s easier to build on it and add more. Also, consider giving yourself clear deadlines or accountability\u2014share your progress with a friend, or mark it on a calendar so you can see your streak build up.

      "body": "Where do I begin?\n\nI'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\n\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)\n\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \"career\" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\n\nI forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \n\n\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \n\n\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \"!?!\" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \n\n\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \n\n\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \n\n\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \n\n\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \n\n\nIf you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \n\n\n3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \n\n\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \n\n\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \n\n\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \n\n\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.",

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but there are definitely ways to start building a path forward.\n\nSince you're having trouble finding a job, consider expanding your search to include online work or gigs that don't require a traditional resume. Websites like Upwork or Fiverr can be a good start for freelance work, even if it's something simple like data entry or graphic design. You can also look into local community centers or libraries for job search resources and workshops.\n\nAs for college, it's not the only path to success. Many people find fulfilling careers through vocational training or apprenticeships, which can be more affordable and quicker to complete. Look into programs that might interest you, even if it's just a little bit, and see if they offer any financial aid or scholarships.\n\nRegarding your interests, it's okay not to have a clear passion right now. Try exploring different fields through free online courses (like Coursera or Khan Academy) to see what might catch your attention. Sometimes, interests develop over time and with exposure to new things.\n\nLastly, learning to drive can open up more job opportunities. Check if there are any community programs that offer free or low-cost driving lessons. It might take some time, but setting small, achievable goals can help you build momentum.\n\nRemember, it's about taking small steps and being patient with yourself. You've got this!",

Often, you'll find that once you start, you'll want to keep going. Also, try to attach the new habit to an existing one.

Instead of skipping a day or waiting for motivation, I\u2019d force myself to show up for just five minutes.

Another thing that helped was creating a ritual around the activity\u2014like making coffee, putting on a certain playlist, or using the same desk setup\u2014so my brain recognized it was time to focus. Eventually, I noticed I\u2019d slip into that flow state more often because I had fewer mental hurdles to clear.

      "body": "So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I will go into further details in this edit.\n\nSome comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\n\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\n\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\n\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\n\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\n\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\n\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.",

Procrastination is a tough habit to break, but it's definitely possible with some small, consistent changes. \n\nFirst, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about an entire project, focus on just the first step. This can make starting feel less overwhelming. Also, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes to work on something. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, you'll find it easier to keep going.\n\nSince the internet is a big distraction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting sites during your study time. You can also try the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make study sessions feel less daunting.\n\nFor your home tasks, try to incorporate them into your daily routine. For example, do a quick 5-minute tidy-up every day instead of waiting for that rare burst of energy. \n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to struggle, and change takes time. Celebrate small victories and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. You've got this!",

Instead of promising to study for two hours, commit to 10 or 15 minutes, then give yourself a quick break. Repeat these little sessions to build momentum and reduce the dread of starting. For distractions, consider putting your phone in another room or using apps that block certain websites during study time so it\u2019s harder to slip into old habits. If you don\u2019t like rigid journaling, try a simple habit tracker or even a short daily recap in your notes app\u2014just enough to keep tabs on progress without feeling like a chore. Finally, pick one small household task to do each day, like tidying up one corner of your room, to train yourself to take action even when you\u2019re not feeling that burst of motivation. It\u2019s all about easing into consistency and building up from there."

If naps re-energize you, try a quick 20-minute nap during lunch, but avoid long naps that can disrupt nighttime sleep. Keep an eye on what you eat at lunch since heavy meals can make you drowsier. For studying, carve out a fixed period\u2014either before or after work\u2014so you have a mental separation between job hours and learning time.

For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.\n\nWhen you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\n\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \"unhealthy\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\n\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot \"fail\" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. \n\nBtw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.\n\nI know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.\n\nF the bikini body, your happiness is more important.

Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternative activities to distract yourself, like going for a walk, reading, or picking up a hobby.\n\n2. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to your food, savoring each bite, and eating slowly. It can help you feel more satisfied with less food.\n\n3. **Healthy Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks on hand for when cravings hit. Things like fruits, veggies, or nuts can be satisfying without adding too many calories.\n\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n5. **Meal Planning**: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive eating.

Here are a few things you might try to help get out of this rut:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small habit to change. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 10 minutes of study or going for a short walk each day. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Limit your time on video games and YouTube. Use apps or tools to block these distractions during study hours. This can help you focus on what you need to do.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for study, exercise, and relaxation. Consistency can help you regain control over your day.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Find a study buddy or someone you trust to check in with regularly. Sharing your goals with someone else can help keep you accountable.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have setbacks. What's important is getting back on track. Celebrate your small victories and don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as planned.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It can help to start by making small promises you know you can keep, even if it\u2019s just studying for 20 minutes or going for a short walk. Each time you follow through, you\u2019ll build a bit more trust in yourself, which can help you stay motivated to do the next thing. Try setting a timer and studying until it goes off, then take a short break\u2014but limit that break so it doesn\u2019t stretch into hours. When it comes to fighting distractions, you might consider blocking certain apps or websites during your study hours and gradually cutting back on the time you spend on gaming or porn. Going back to the gym, even if it\u2019s just a quick 15-minute workout, could also help you feel more energized and focused. The important thing is to commit to small daily goals and show yourself you can stick to them, even on days you don\u2019t feel like it. Over time, those small wins will add up and help you get back on track."

With your new ADHD diagnosis, it's great that you're starting medication and therapy, which can really help with focus and routine.\n\nFor building structure, try starting small.

Use tools like planners or apps to keep track of your tasks and appointments. Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can make them feel less overwhelming.\n\nSince you're in the UK and sunlight can be scarce, consider using a light therapy lamp to help regulate your sleep and mood. Also, keep nurturing your social connections and hobbies, as they can provide a sense of balance and joy.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks.

        "o1_comment": "It sounds like you\u2019ve already made huge strides by seeking a diagnosis, starting therapy, and working out a plan with medication. One practical way to build on that is to create small daily check-ins for yourself at consistent times. It could be as simple as setting an alarm in the morning to remind you of your top three goals for the day, then another alarm at night to briefly see how it went. That rhythm can help you stay aware of where you stand, even if ADHD makes it tough to keep focus. Another idea is to schedule your most important tasks when your medication\u2019s effects are strongest so you\u2019re not fighting your own brain chemistry. You can also reward yourself for those tasks you complete\u2014a small treat, a moment on social media, anything to make the process feel more positive. Over time, those small wins build motivation, and you\u2019ll start trusting your ability to handle bigger goals without waiting for someone to force you. It may not be perfect every day, but showing up for yourself consistently, even in small doses, is what really cements discipline. Good luck, and keep going\u2014you\u2019re doing better than you think."

        "gpt_comment": "Finding a balance between indulging in distractions and dealing with anxiety can be tough, but it's definitely possible with some small steps. Start by setting aside a short, dedicated time each day to be device-free. Use this time to engage in activities that are calming but still engaging, like reading a book, drawing, or going for a walk. This can help ease you into being comfortable with your thoughts without overwhelming anxiety. Also, consider practicing mindfulness or meditation for a few minutes daily. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and reduce anxiety over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be patient with yourself as you work towards finding that middle ground.",
        "o1_comment": "One approach is to start slowly easing the gap between screen time and full-on anxiety. Tiny steps help; for example, set a short timer (like 15 minutes) to do something mildly productive or relaxing that\u2019s not scrolling on your phone\u2014maybe reading a few pages of a book, going for a brief walk, or doing a mindful breathing exercise. Spending small chunks of time away from your devices can build your tolerance for discomfort and help you practice handling anxious thoughts in manageable doses. Gradually increase those chunks as you get more comfortable. You don\u2019t have to force yourself into long, unstructured breaks right away; just aim to build the habit of tolerating a little stress without defaulting to instant dopamine hits. Over time, you\u2019ll likely find that balance comes more naturally, and you\u2019ll start feeling more in control of your schedule and thoughts."

Also, consider not letting your weekend start with a late-night binge\u2014set a reminder on your phone to shut down screens by a certain hour.

This means a comfortable mattress, blackout curtains, and a cool room temperature.

Try to keep your wind-down routine consistent every night to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n3. **Light Exposure**: In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. This can help reset your internal clock and make waking up easier. If natural light isn't an option, consider a light therapy lamp.\n\n4. **Alarm Variety**: Since Alarmy worked well for you, maybe try varying the types of puzzles or challenges it offers. This can keep your brain engaged and prevent you from getting too used to the same routine.\n\n5. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Incorporating a short mindfulness or meditation practice before bed can help improve sleep quality, making it easier to wake up.\n\nRemember, perfection isn't always necessary, and even a 70% success rate is a solid foundation.

I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.\nI got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn\u2019t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I\u2019ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I\u2019m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don\u2019t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I\u2019ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy.

This can make your workload feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.\n\n3. **Establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily routine that includes time for self-care, even if it's just a short walk or a few minutes of meditation. Consistency can help bring some stability to your life.\n\n4. **Reach Out for Support**: It sounds like therapy hasn't been as helpful as you'd like, but don't give up on finding support. Consider looking for support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Guidance**: If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or a hotline. They can provide immediate support and help you find a path forward.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for the support you deserve.",

You\u2019ve already shown you can pull yourself together when you put your mind to it\u2014like passing your classes after everything went sideways. Try to keep that momentum going with small, consistent steps each day. Even just having a regular wake-up time, blocking out time for schoolwork, and removing temptations (like deleting your ex\u2019s number or social media) can help you focus on what matters. It might feel isolating to only do school and work, but consider looking for smaller, low-pressure ways to connect with new people at your university or online communities. You don\u2019t need a big circle to find friends who care. Finally, you might want to keep up therapy or other forms of professional help alongside your routine changes. It won\u2019t be magic overnight, but each little disciplined habit adds up. You\u2019ve managed to bounce back this far\u2014don\u2019t underestimate your ability to keep going."

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-esteem and social anxiety, and there are ways to work through it.\n\nStart small. Pick one thing you want to improve and focus on that. For example, if it's social skills, try setting a goal to have a short conversation with someone each day, even if it's just a simple \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" It might feel awkward at first, but practice helps.\n\nFor ADHD, consider breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Use tools like timers or apps to help with time management. It can also be helpful to write things down to keep track of what you need to do.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be introverted. You don't have to be the life of the party to be successful or happy. Embrace who you are and focus on your strengths. Maybe look for jobs that align with your interests and where being introverted is an asset.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself. Everyone has their own journey, and comparing yourself to others can be a trap. Celebrate small victories and progress, no matter how minor they seem. You've got this!",

Consider testing out different paths in small steps: take a temp gig or volunteer somewhere for just a few hours a week. That can build real-world experience and give you a sense of where you might fit without fully committing. Also, small daily habits like using a reminder app or writing out short to-do lists can help with time management and reduce the stress of forgetting things. Each small win you collect is a step toward seeing yourself in a more positive light. It\u2019s natural to doubt yourself, but it doesn\u2019t have to rule you\u2014focus on these tiny steps, and you\u2019ll start feeling more prepared for bigger challenges down the line."

Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Create a Morning Ritual**: Since you used to wake up for your job, try to recreate that sense of urgency. Set a small task that you have to do immediately after waking up, like making your bed or doing a quick stretch. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to start the day.\n\n2. **Accountability Partner**: Find a friend or family member who can check in with you in the morning. Sometimes knowing someone else is counting on you can be a powerful motivator.\n\n3. **Gradual Change**: If waking up early is too big of a leap, try adjusting your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day. This can make the transition smoother and less daunting.\n\n4. **Reward System**: Give yourself a small reward for waking up on time. It could be something simple like enjoying a favorite breakfast or a few minutes of a hobby you love.\n\n5. **Reflect on Your Why**: Remind yourself why these exams are important to you. Visualize the benefits of passing them and how it will impact your future. This can help reignite that internal motivation.\n\nRemember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself.

For example, place your alarm somewhere you actually have to walk to, and then do something active right away, like splashing water on your face or doing a few squats to get your blood flowing. It may sound simple, but that immediate physical activity can break the drowsiness that tempts you back to bed. If you can, add an external commitment in the early morning\u2014like a quick phone call with a friend, a study buddy session, or even a brief walk with someone else\u2014so there\u2019s a sense of urgency and accountability. Lastly, try to remind yourself that you\u2019ve done it before: your ability to wake up for work came from having a real consequence in mind. See if you can recreate that sense of seriousness now by defining your own stakes (maybe missing study time means postponing career goals), and reinforce it daily so you don\u2019t give in to that morning fog."

        "best_comment": "You need to grow your self confidence.\n\nIn my case. I studied some philosophy.\n\nAlso, you need to be smart to take this criticism like a good sign. Cuz if they have some critics about you, actually you need to think why are they doing this?\n\nIf you feel like you are doing things ok and you know who you are and have a clear goal and objectives that are aligned with your perspective of life, moral and ethics. \n\nThen there is a big chance that they only are making criticism about themselves. Cuz are ppl out there that doesn't have a little of confidence to achieve that you are achieving. Or actually envy your actual position or anything that you are doing. \n\nYou need to be able to identify which critics actually are good for you. Be humble, and accept the critics that can be an improvement for you. Be smart, think about this critics like only information that comes to you. You decide to use it in the way you need. Don't waste good information but if the info comes with hate or trash words, just don't waste your time arguing or being mad, don't auto sabotage your mind.\n\nIn all of the cases that I mentioned critics are so good because if ppl are talking shit or want to demotivate you. It is sign that you are doing things ok. If they are good, the critics are constructive cuz they want you to be better. But in the other hand if they are bad, the critics are trash cuz they envy you and don't want you to success. \n\nBut always listen, and take advantage of information.\n\nMost of ppl actually don't want others to grow and have success in life cuz in that way they feel less bad.\n\nKeep going.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Write down all the things you think are worth criticizing. Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much everything. Don\u2019t take yourself so seriously.",
        "gpt_comment": "One way to develop a thicker skin is to reframe how you view criticism. Instead of seeing it as a personal attack, try to see it as an opportunity for growth. When someone criticizes you, ask yourself if there's any truth to what they're saying and how you can use it to improve. It might help to remind yourself that everyone has room for improvement and that criticism is a part of learning and growing. Also, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of being human. Over time, this mindset shift can help you become more resilient to criticism. Lastly, consider setting small goals to expose yourself to constructive feedback regularly, like asking a trusted friend for their honest opinion on something specific. This can help you gradually build up your tolerance and learn to handle criticism more effectively.",
        "o1_comment": "One approach is to remind yourself that feedback doesn\u2019t define who you are as a whole; it\u2019s just someone else\u2019s perspective on a specific aspect of your work or behavior. Try to identify any useful takeaways, then let go of the parts that aren\u2019t constructive. It helps to pause for a moment before reacting\u2014or even journal if it really stings\u2014so you can process it more objectively. Over time, you\u2019ll build resilience by seeing mistakes and negative feedback as normal parts of growth. It also helps to accept that not everyone will like you, and that\u2019s okay. What matters most is taking what you can learn, making improvements where possible, and then moving forward without dwelling. This kind of consistent focus on learning rather than self-judgment can gradually make criticism feel less personal."

        "best_comment": "A couple of things:\n\nTry not to bring junk food into your house - you only need to say no once at the store, you need to do it 1000 times at home.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It's great that you're aware of the issue and looking to make a change. Here are a few steps that might help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Identify Triggers**: Try to figure out what situations or emotions lead you to reach for junk food. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know your triggers, you can work on addressing them directly.\n\n2. **Healthy Alternatives**: Stock up on healthier snacks that you enjoy. If you have a sweet tooth, try fruits like berries or apples. Sometimes just having a healthier option available can make a big difference.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to the taste, texture, and satisfaction of your food. It can help you enjoy your meals more and reduce the urge to snack mindlessly.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try setting small, achievable goals. For example, limit yourself to a certain amount of chocolate per week and gradually reduce it.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Incorporate some physical activity into your routine. It doesn't have to be intense; even a daily walk can help manage cravings and improve your mood.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "One thing that can help is removing most of the junk food from your home so it\u2019s not right at your fingertips when cravings hit. If it\u2019s out of sight, it\u2019s easier to avoid. You could also try planning your meals and snacks in advance\u2014make sure you have healthy alternatives ready, like fruit or yogurt, before the urge strikes. If you still want chocolate, limit yourself to a small piece of dark chocolate instead of a full bar. It might help to keep a simple food journal so you can track patterns and see where you can cut back. Over time, those small choices build up and you\u2019ll notice yourself craving junk less frequently."

It's easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others, but remember that everyone is on their own journey. Your friend might seem more mature or knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean you can't grow and learn too. \n\nStart small. Pick one thing you want to improve or learn about and dedicate a little time each day to it. It could be reading a book, listening to a podcast, or even just observing the world around you. The key is consistency, not perfection. \n\nAlso, consider writing down your thoughts. It might help you articulate your feelings better and give you a clearer picture of what you want to change. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Progress takes time, and every small step counts. You're worth it, and you have the potential to make a positive impact on yourself and others.

Even if it seems pointless, it\u2019s a tiny win that pulls you out of feeling like you \u201cdo nothing.\u201d If you\u2019re worried about how articulate your friend is, try journaling your thoughts or talking into a voice memo for practice. It\u2019s normal for this stuff to feel awkward at first. Over time, these mini-habits teach your mind you can improve and learn. You don\u2019t have to solve everything all at once. Aim for simpler steps every day, and you might find that slow progress builds your confidence and gives you some relief. There\u2019s no one right way to grow\u2014just keep taking small, consistent actions and be patient with yourself."

You could also try setting a specific morning routine that you look forward to, like making a nice breakfast or doing a quick workout. Having something positive to focus on can help shift your attention away from your phone. If you still want to use your phone as an alarm, consider using apps that lock you out of social media for a set period after waking up. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "I\u2019d suggest putting your phone in a spot where you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off, and set a rule for yourself not to open any apps until you\u2019ve finished your bathroom routine or eaten breakfast. If it\u2019s too tempting, consider using a focus or app-blocking mode on your phone in the morning so social media is locked for the first 15\u201330 minutes of your day. This small shift can help break the habit of mindless scrolling and give you a chance to ease into your morning with more intention."

        "percentile_10_comment": "One possible solution is that don't start with some upheaval task or don't try to finish a task at once. Tell yourself that you're gonna spend only 40 mins on this and no more even if you have really gotten into the rythm. This is because it will help your mind to condition it in a way that you'll think no matter how horrible a task is you won't spend more than 40 mins at a time. Do this with pretty much every task. Whether you love or hate it. Allot it 40 mins or any short period of time and don't extend no matter what. \n\nYou said you know you can do better which means you have some level of confidence so sometimes people don't even start just because they think it's just a tough task. So you just need to fight that resistance. A lot of times if you're able to fight that resistance you realise that this task wasn't as tough as you thought it'd be. \n\nAlso fear can drive people. Be fearful and really force your mind to think the consequences so that you can induce a visceral emotion in yourself about the consequences or the embarrassment you might have to face. \n\nAlso have some hobby(small or big doesn't matter) that you can look forward to. That can help you to keep going when thinks get tough. You'll think that once you're done with all the crap you can spend some time on that and enjoy yourself. Hope this was helpful!",

For chores, try knocking them out at a set hour each day so you don\u2019t dread it all day long; just accept it\u2019s part of your routine and get it over with. Setting reminders on your phone to work on your assignments before you feel the panic can also help. The key is to build the habit of starting early, even if it\u2019s just a little. Reward yourself with something small after you hit your target time\u2014it can keep you motivated to stay on track. And if you slip up, don\u2019t beat yourself up; just refocus and keep going."

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule, and it's understandable how that can spiral into other areas of life. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Gradual Adjustment**: Instead of trying to reset your sleep schedule all at once, try shifting it gradually. Aim to go to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can be more sustainable and less jarring for your body.\n\n2. **Consistent Routine**: Establish a consistent bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, taking a warm shower, or practicing relaxation techniques.\n\n3. **Limit Screen Time**: Try to reduce exposure to screens at least an hour before bed. The blue light emitted by phones and computers can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n4. **Natural Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure during the day, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your internal clock and improve your mood.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Consider sharing your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware of your efforts can be motivating.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned ADHD, it might be worth discussing your sleep issues with a healthcare professional. They can offer tailored advice and support.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to inch your bedtime earlier by small increments instead of trying a drastic jump. For instance, if you usually crash at 7am, aim for 6:30am one night, then 6am the next, and so on, until you\u2019re getting closer to a more reasonable hour. Try to keep to a schedule even on weekends or off days\u2014consistency really makes a difference. Staying active during the day also helps reset your body\u2019s clock. Maybe schedule an early morning walk or get a daylight lamp so you\u2019re exposed to bright light soon after waking. If you slip up, don\u2019t dwell on it; just try again the next day. And since you mentioned ADHD, it could be worth exploring structure-friendly apps or timers that send reminders or shut off certain apps after a certain time. Ultimately, building a sleep routine is about small steps and sticking to them, even when it feels inconvenient at first. It can get better with persistence. Good luck."

I\u2019ve tried to see YouTube videos, googled etc, but I just can\u2019t clean properly. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m like this. I can\u2019t even have guests.

Once you clean your house, It's mostly about maintaining that level through routines. I recommend unf*ck your habitat and the flylady for some simple routine building. \nTo get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it's really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash? You can start by sorting laundry into one place (can be a big corner pile even) to do a load a day until it's done, and a bag of trash on a timer a day. It didn't get messy all in one day, so you won't get it clean that fast either. But by taking small steps it can get better faster than you think. Good luck!",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself\u2014cleaning can be overwhelming, especially when you're juggling work, studies, and other activities. Here\u2019s a simple approach that might help:\n\nStart small. Pick one area or room to focus on, like your bedroom or living room. Set a timer for 15-20 minutes and do what you can in that time. This makes it less daunting and helps build momentum. Once you see progress in one area, it can motivate you to tackle others.\n\nCreate a routine. Try to incorporate a few minutes of tidying up into your daily schedule. For example, spend 5 minutes each morning making your bed or clearing surfaces. Consistency is key, and over time, these small habits can make a big difference.\n\nConsider a decluttering session. Sometimes, having too much stuff can make cleaning feel impossible. Go through your things and decide what you really need or love. Donate or discard the rest. Less clutter means less to clean.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's a friend or a professional cleaner, sometimes a little assistance can make a huge difference and teach you new strategies.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "Cleaning can feel overwhelming when you\u2019re juggling a busy schedule, so start small and build consistency. Try setting a timer for just 10 or 15 minutes each day and tackle one spot at a time. Do your dishes right after meals so they don\u2019t stack up, and throw in a load of laundry more frequently instead of letting it build. After you finish a small task, you\u2019ll get a little boost of motivation that makes the next one easier. Sticking with this routine helps you form a habit, and over time, your house will stay cleaner without feeling like a huge chore. If you miss a day or two, don\u2019t sweat it\u2014just pick up where you left off and keep going."

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and while I'm not a professional, I can offer some tips that might help you get started on a better path.\n\n1. **Small Steps**: Start with tiny, manageable goals. Instead of thinking about studying for hours, aim for just 10-15 minutes. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n2. **Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn't have to be perfect, but having a set time to wake up, study, and relax can help create a sense of normalcy and control.\n\n3. **Breaks and Rewards**: Use breaks as a reward system. After a short study session, give yourself a small reward, like a quick walk or a snack. This can help train your brain to associate effort with positive outcomes.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you've already uninstalled social media, maybe try setting specific times for gaming or phone use. This way, you can enjoy them without them taking over your day.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If possible, talk to someone about how you're feeling. Whether it's a friend, family member, or a counselor, having someone to share your struggles with can be really helpful.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep trying and be kind to yourself in the process. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to bring back structure and gradually restart the things you used to enjoy, even if you\u2019re not feeling it at first. Start ridiculously small\u2014like studying for five minutes or picking up that instrument for just a couple of chords\u2014so your brain sees it as doable. Once you commit to five minutes, you\u2019ll often find yourself going longer. Another trick is scheduling your gaming time so you have a clear boundary: you get a block of uninterrupted play after you\u2019ve made genuine progress on your work. It\u2019s also worth getting checked out if you suspect ADHD or something else might be at play, because that can open doors to real solutions. Most importantly, don\u2019t treat a slip-up as the end of the road; treat it like a small detour. If you make a little progress each day, you\u2019ll be surprised at how momentum can build. Good luck\u2014you\u2019re not stuck forever."

For example, if you're trying to cut down on screen time, start with a 15-minute reduction each day. Next, track your progress. This could be as simple as marking a calendar or using an app. Seeing your progress can be really motivating. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.

One approach you might find helpful is to integrate shorter, more flexible workouts into your routine. Even 10-15 minutes of exercise can be effective and easier to fit into a busy schedule. Consider scheduling these mini-sessions during breaks or right after a class to make them a regular part of your day. Also, try to view exercise as a way to recharge rather than another task on your to-do list. It might help to set a non-negotiable time for exercise, just like you would for a class or meeting.

Consistency, even if it\u2019s small, is the key\u2014once you get used to moving every day, it\u2019s easier to pick up intensity later. Also, put an end date on your \u201ccrazy week\u201d so you know exactly when you\u2019ll jump back in rather than letting it drag out for weeks.

Small wins can build momentum.\n\nFor the fear of the unknown, try to reframe it as curiosity. What if the changes you make lead to something amazing? You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out. Just take one step at a time. Also, consider setting up some accountability. Maybe a friend or a study group can help keep you on track.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Change is hard, and setbacks are part of the process. Celebrate the small victories and keep moving forward. You\u2019ve got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It can help to start by making the smallest possible change and building momentum. For instance, set a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes of studying and do that once a day\u2014no matter what. Once you\u2019ve hit that tiny goal, give yourself permission to stop if you want. That keeps you from feeling overwhelmed and proves you can follow through. The same principle works for moving your body: do a quick stretch, a short walk, or a couple of push-ups to get used to the act of starting. Each time you follow through, you chip away at that \u201cinvisible shackle\u201d feeling and build a new track record of accountability. As for your phone, try something like giving yourself one phone-free hour right when you wake up to focus on study or exercise. Small, consistent habits are less daunting and more likely to stick. When you\u2019re worried about the unknown, practice focusing on each day\u2019s immediate goal instead of the long-term outcome\u2014your future self will thank you for every little step you take now."

Dealing with both weight and depression can feel overwhelming, but small, consistent changes can make a big difference over time. Start by setting very manageable goals. For example, try to incorporate a short daily walk, even if it's just around the block. This can help with both your mood and your weight. Also, focus on making one small change to your diet, like adding more veggies or cutting back on sugary drinks. Remember, it's not about perfection, but progress. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself along the way. If you can, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can provide support tailored to your situation. You've got this!",

Consistency is what really matters\u2014try doing something active at the same time each day, whether that\u2019s a walk, a gentle workout video, or stretching before bed.

Here are a few thoughts that might help you find some direction:\n\n1. **Start Small**: If you're interested in design but unsure about school, try taking a few online courses or workshops. This can help you gauge your interest and build some foundational skills without a huge commitment.\n\n2. **Explore Your Passions**: Since you love animals, maybe look into volunteering at a shelter or working part-time at a pet store. This could give you a sense of fulfillment and help you decide if you want to pursue something more in that field.\n\n3. **Balance and Prioritize**: If you decide to go back to school, consider part-time classes. Many people work and study simultaneously, but it's important to find a balance that works for you. Prioritize what's most important to you right now, whether it's education, work, or relationships.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Overthinking can be paralyzing, so try setting small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning something new or setting aside time each week to explore different interests.\n\n5. **Stay Open and Flexible**: Life is a journey, and it's okay to change paths. What matters is that you're moving forward and learning along the way.\n\nRemember, it's perfectly fine to take your time figuring things out. You're already on the right track by putting yourself first and exploring what you love. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "Sometimes the easiest next step is just to pick one path that sounds interesting and begin, even if it\u2019s with a single class or a small side gig. If you love design but doubt your discipline, try an online intro course or volunteer for a small design project to see if you enjoy the grind before committing to a degree. Same goes for working with animals\u2014maybe shadow a vet or volunteer at a shelter. The key is starting small and consistently showing up, even when you\u2019re uncertain. People juggle work, school, and personal lives by mapping out their priorities weekly, focusing on tasks like \u201cone chapter a night\u201d or \u201cgym before class,\u201d rather than trying to do everything at once. You\u2019ll find your rhythm when you stop worrying about doing it perfectly and just do it consistently.

      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I'd suggest to try breaking down the 'complex' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)\n\nFor example: \n\n1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you're trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your 'excuse' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. \n\nThe goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being 'complex' or 'scary'. You just see all things you did 'wrong' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren't that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be 'beaten' / fixed.\n\nBesides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to 'stop escaping' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don't need it. Let's cross-check it altogether, let's not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you'd like to stop escaping in first place.\n\n**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let's imagine (for example) it's social media. \n\nFine - for the list of things you 'escaped', out of 10 things - let's imagine that 5 were 'escaped' due to social media distraction. If it's true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it's something else - doesn't matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).\n\n**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before).

        "gpt_comment": "Escapism is something a lot of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. One approach to tackle this is to start small and gradually build up your discipline. First, identify the specific activities you use for escapism and set limits on them. For example, if you find yourself binge-watching shows, decide on a specific time limit for watching each day. \n\nNext, try to replace some of that escapism time with activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or going for a walk to clear your mind. \n\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for the tasks you're avoiding. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming. Reward yourself for completing these tasks, even if it's just a small treat or a break to do something you enjoy. \n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to seek help if you need it.

Another strategy is to schedule your escapist activity for a specific time so it becomes a reward rather than a distraction. If you keep track of what triggers you to avoid real work\u2014maybe boredom, frustration, or fatigue\u2014you can head it off by taking short breaks or switching tasks before you wander off completely. Over time, these small steps build a habit of facing your responsibilities instead of running from them.

I live in patterns, i live day in and day out in patterns in my mind and my actions, it never ceases, i always can recognize the patterns which are harmful, but i am too paralyzed to stop them\n\n\nI am only getting older, i know some responses are going to be about going to the gym but how do i even tell my ego and fear to shut up so i can get there\n\nI am constantly depressing my dead relatives if they are watching by acting out in harmful ways to myself and others, i feel like i am made of stone, i stood on a bridge 3 months ago thinking about jumping but i knew i never could because i dont have the guts and i would rather survive the fall to get sympathy and live hedonistically and say i survived to fool others and myself into thinking i am strong \n\n\nI go to college soon, i dont know how to become more stable, maybe that is a lie too\n\n\nAny advice please, i do want change but my subconscious knows how to avoid the change and be the same forever \n\nI dont want to be 35 years old and still be 18 mentally",

        "best_comment": "One thing I will say is a lot of things that you seem to be beating yourself for, are the same types of problems that you\u2019ll find in a lot of people. I know it feels like you\u2019re alone in your struggles but you are not.\n\nAlso, while reading this, it\u2019s seems like you are demanding a lot of yourself and punishing yourself when you don\u2019t meet those standards. First thing, I\u2019d say is to focus more on being more gentle with yourself. It\u2019s ok to have desires but try to stray away from the \u201cdo or die\u201d mindset and just focus on thinking of it more optimistically. Don\u2019t think \u201cI have to do this or x will happen\u201d but more \u201cIf I do this, x will happen\u201d. \n\nTrain yourself to do that everyday and you\u2019ll see change eventually. You\u2019ll be looking at your life with a healthier perspective and your desires will naturally be answered because of that. Patience and perseverance is key though. Take it day by day, and don\u2019t tell yourself that you are running out of time, as long as you are working towards what you want to accomplish in the present moment, you have time.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I\u2019ve been there. Turns out I had a lot of trauma that turned into anxiety that turned into numbness and/or inappropriate emotional reactions. I didn\u2019t understand me cuz I couldn\u2019t feel me. And I couldn\u2019t feel me because it was unbearable. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s today. Maybe it\u2019s five years from now. (A therapist or close friend can definitely help expedite the process.) One day you feel your feels. Pat yourself on the back if you do. This is called emotional processing and it\u2019s necessary to heal but it doesn\u2019t need to be rushed.\n\nYou\u2019ll be okay.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to commend you for reaching out. That's a big step in itself. Here are a few thoughts that might help you start moving forward:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one small habit to work on. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or going for a 5-minute walk. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Try to spend a few minutes each day reflecting on your thoughts and feelings. Journaling can be a great way to get to know yourself better and start identifying what truly matters to you.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide guidance and help you work through these feelings. It's okay to ask for help, and it can make a big difference.\n\n4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break down your goals into manageable steps. Instead of thinking about where you want to be in years, focus on what you can do this week or even today.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and it's okay to have setbacks. Treat yourself with the same kindness and patience you would offer a friend.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "It might help to start small, because everything feels overwhelming when you\u2019re stuck in your own head. Even something like setting a simple routine\u2014waking up at a consistent time, making your bed, going for a short walk\u2014can build a tiny sense of momentum. Those small wins show you that you can decide to do something and follow through, which eventually helps quiet the fear that whispers you\u2019ll never change. If the idea of the gym scares you, try replacing it with another physical activity that fits your comfort zone first, like walks, jogging, or even short at-home workouts. Over time, you might find it easier to step into a gym once you\u2019re used to moving regularly.\n\nTry finding at least one thing that really grabs your interest, whether it\u2019s reading, art, music, or anything that makes you curious. Spending time on something you genuinely enjoy can anchor you in feeling like a person with passions rather than someone reacting to fear. Journaling or writing down your thoughts for just a few minutes every day can help you see patterns in how you think, and that new awareness makes it easier to notice when fear takes over and to challenge it.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling so overwhelmed that you\u2019ve considered that extreme step of harming yourself, please reach out for professional help as soon as you can. Contact a counselor, your campus health center when you start college, or a trusted hotline. Talking to someone about these thoughts can feel scary, but it\u2019s a strong move toward finding stability. You\u2019re not alone, and there\u2019s support out there for both your mental health struggles and for practical steps to build the discipline you want. It takes patience, but every small action you stick to can add up to real change over time. You deserve that chance. Good luck, and take care."

      "body": "TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?\n\n(30-Age)\nAlright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don\u2019t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very na\u00efve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don\u2019t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn\u2019t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don\u2019t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",

I\u2019ve been doing what I can to turn myself around. I\u2019ve been going to therapy, I\u2019ve been working on myself by looking long and hard at my life, I\u2019ve been working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof method, etc. What really started to make a big difference was my diet - I went zero carb and my mental health improved dramatically. The effect would not have been so big without the other stuff, I think. \nIn short - have faith, work on yourself, try every day, strive to be and one day you will wake up who you want to be.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and considering therapy and talking to a doctor. That's a huge step in the right direction. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar feelings and challenges.\n\nStarting small can be really helpful. Pick one thing you want to work on and focus on that. It could be as simple as setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a hobby or exercise. The key is to build small, manageable habits that can gradually lead to bigger changes. \n\nAlso, try to be kind to yourself. It's easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate your wins, even if they seem minor. \n\nLastly, don't compare your journey to others. Everyone has their own path, and what works for someone else might not work for you. Focus on what makes you feel good and what you want to achieve. You've got this!",
        "o1_comment": "Starting small can really help when everything seems overwhelming. Try picking just one habit or goal\u2014something doable\u2014and commit to it daily. For example, if you want to build consistency, set a specific time to wake up or tackle one recurring task (like tidying up your space) each day so your brain gets used to the rhythm. If it feels too hard, scale it down until it\u2019s almost impossible to fail. Little wins give you a sense of forward momentum and help rebuild trust in yourself. Therapy and talking with your doctor are great moves too. It can take time to figure out what sparks real motivation, but each small success strengthens that discipline muscle. Even if it feels awkward at first, keep pushing forward and let those daily actions speak louder than your doubts."

      "body": "I do a multitude of things. I write, read, draw, make music, design book covers, learn languages and lately picked up (and dropped) chess. I even liked studying because I loved my field. \n\nI just can't seem to tolerate the actual process of sitting down and engaging in any of them anymore. I really want to but I can't stand it. I can't write anything, can't draw, can't study--can't stand doing anything persistantly for more than 10 to 15 minutes. I get stressed out and anxious pretty easily and quickly switch to something else to detach my mind. \n\n\nOn the rare occasions I sit down and really get sucked into something I *can* actually go for hours on end. If I can somehow get myself to be like this all the time, I'd be killing it rn. But it feels like there's a block in my mind stopping me, like a writer's block or an art block, except for my mind as a whole. Cheesy analogy, I know. \n\n\nThought maybe adhd for a while but I dropped that suspicion. Can't say if I've always been like this. This either started or became noticeably bad enough at the beginning of last year/late 2020. Can't say much about my childhood since i don't remember much anyways beside just being a lonely weirdo. \n\n\nPersonal life aside, my greatest concern rn is my tilting academics. I know what I need to do, I can hash out a good plan to do it, I want to do it, I know I can if I can bring myself to it. But I just can't. Can't start, can't keep going. Some days I'm moderately motivated, others I'm detached. Either way I'm doing nothing. Semester started about six weeks ago, I'm quickly falling behind. My mind, body and heart are refusing to cooperate. \n\n\nCan't afford time and money for therapists atm. If anyone has any tips on how to manage this on my own and combat this behaviourally/mentally please share\n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to emphasize that I do not believe I have had this issue further back than 2021 or 2020. I'm turning 23. This is fairly recent. I relate to r/adhd but it's hard to distinguish adhd from chronic stress for example. The symptoms are similar, the actual culprit is hard to pin point. So I don't think specifically assuming adhd out of a whole bunch is wise, and I'm trying not to carry it anymore \n\nEither way I'm looking for practical tips that don't involve me going to a therapist because there are literally none around me and if I find one I can't afford seeing them or the meds (bc, developing country w civil unrest rn)",

        "best_comment": "Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few strategies that might help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes to work on a task. The goal is to make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n2. **Routine and Environment**: Create a dedicated space and time for your activities. Even if it's just a corner of your room, having a consistent spot can help signal to your brain that it's time to focus.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Breaks**: Practice mindfulness techniques to help manage stress and anxiety. Also, schedule regular breaks to prevent burnout. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break) can be effective.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what typically distracts you and try to minimize these interruptions. This could mean turning off notifications or using apps that block distracting websites.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of each day, take a few minutes to reflect on what worked and what didn\u2019t. Adjust your approach as needed.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
        "o1_comment": "Sometimes, going smaller and simpler helps. Try telling yourself you\u2019re only going to do a task for five minutes. For those five minutes, remove as many distractions as you can: silence your phone, close unrelated apps, and commit to that short burst. If you feel like continuing, keep going; otherwise, stop and come back later for another small session. These short, focused intervals can gradually train your mind to stay on tasks longer. You can also pick the easiest part of what you need to do first\u2014like free-writing a couple lines or sketching a rough outline\u2014so you lower the mental barrier to getting started. Even if you have to repeat these mini-sessions multiple times a day, it can help you ease into deeper focus and build up your tolerance for longer sessions. Over time, the five-minute rule can grow into a habit and make it easier to push through the initial resistance without feeling stuck or overwhelmed."
