      "title": "[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.",
      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

That’s a significant achievement, and it showcases your ability to commit to a goal. Starting from where you are, consider these steps to improve well-being and discipline:\n 1. **Set small, achievable goals**: Start with manageable goals that help you build confidence. This could be as simple as maintaining a healthier diet consistently or dedicating an hour each day to learning a new skill or job searching.\n 2. **Seek professional help**: Given your background with depression and substance use, speaking to a mental health professional can provide you with tailored strategies to cope and move forward.\n 3. **Financial literacy**: Educate yourself about budgeting and financial management. There are plenty of free resources online that can help you understand how to manage and control your finances effectively.\n 4. **Build a routine**: Structure your day to include time for job applications, skill development, physical activity, and leisure. This helps in reducing the feeling of aimlessness and increases productivity.\n 5. **Connect with others**: Try to rebuild or strengthen relationships with family or friends. Social support is crucial for mental health and can provide motivation and accountability.\n 6. **Mindfulness and presence**: Engage in mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga. These can help improve your focus and reduce the dominance of negative thoughts."

But, for short term solutions or when my meds aren’t kicking in:\nThe podcast “sleep with me” is great, literally bores you to sleep with mindless rambling. Or, the podcast “stuff you should know”, and pick a boring topic. And I’d echo the first comment about elevating your legs, even a pillow under the knees. Sometimes when I can’t sleep I try to sleep on the couch, are you able to change your scenery? Sometimes even the floor with pillows is weirdly enough to reset my brain. Another trick I use is to close your eyes and start planning something very far in the future that is non-consequential. Like your wedding day or exactly how you’d lay out a castle if you lived in it. Or, get out of bed and start reading a dry book, realize how tired you are, and get back in bed lol. Follow along to a 5 minute deep breathing video on the floor. An app I like that is very calming is called Monument- a simple puzzle game that has lovely music and colors. Lastly, everybody is human and sometimes rescheduling your morning event is the best thing- people will probably understand.

This has led me to limit myself and doubt every decision I make.

Success in these smaller endeavors can boost your confidence.\n 3. **Positive affirmations**: Regularly affirm your capabilities and strengths.

I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. \n\nI have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. \n\nHow can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.\n\nEdit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted.

        "best_comment": "26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

I listen to my body more, I rest more and quit drinking, I take the time to do painting / drawing, whatever creative activity calms me down. Cut out all social media except for Reddit sometimes, never at night. I started feeling more relaxed in the evenings, and I came to enjoy reading a book at 10pm as much as I used to enjoy binge watching Netflix all night.

        "best_comment": "I will give you my advice, but I think I should provide some context to help you decide what is it worth.\n\nI am a doctor currently finishing a dual specialisation in two specialities, one in pathology and one in clinical medicine. I have had to sit a LOT of exams, some of which were among the most stressful and intense experiences of my life. I would have similar anxiety spirals in the lead up to them. Exams are stressful.\n\nBefore each exam, or during each storm of panic, the single most helpful thing I did was breathe. Sit up straight at your desk, close your eyes, and breathe in deeply, hold it for a few seconds, and then out. Google “box breathing” for more detailed techniques. It is amazing how much the simple act of breathing can pull you out of your thoughts, reaffirm you are alive, and that it will all be ok.\n\nThe second most important thing to do is take small steps. Set yourself small, achievable goals. Write a paragraph, or read some text, then break for 5 minutes and have a cup of tea, or some other small, easy reward. Lengthen the amount of time you spend working until you find your mind drifting, then another small break. Small breaks are ok, and essential to remaining productive over a whole session. I do 50 minute sessions, 10 minute breaks, but find the mix that is right for you. If you can only do 25 minutes, that is ok. 25min is > 0 min.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, beware the mental trap of exams. Exams trick you into thinking they are the most important event in your life, and are linked to your worth as a person/student/academic/whatever. They are neither. They are simply another small hurdle in  a very long journey getting you where you want to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps, but regardless, good luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Breathe, small increments, take the long view.\n\nedit: grammar.",

        "gpt_comment": "The fear and anxiety you experience around exam preparation are common, but there are effective strategies to manage them. First, establish a structured study schedule with clear, achievable goals each day, breaking your material into manageable chunks. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, which involves studying in 25-minute intervals followed by short breaks. This can help maintain focus without becoming overwhelmed. Additionally, practice mindfulness or deep breathing exercises to reduce anxiety and improve concentration. Seek support from friends or a study group to feel less isolated in your preparation."

        "best_comment": "Same. And I haven't found any way or method that universally, always helps me cope better with this. In a way that makes sense - to be human means to operate in changeable situations, and to not always do what should be done. So the solutions are also going to look different day-to-day and sometimes they won't work. The key thing is to try different stuff, to have lots of different \"tools\" to try in this situation, but even that will not always work. One of the most difficult hurdles is using a tool in the first place, just as you articulate. But, I believe you can do it at least some of the time! I believe you can develop some tools for moment-to-moment use. And hopefully you can find something to help longer-term too (I agree that depression and ADHD are possible underlying things that are happening here).\n\nSome things that help me, to give you an example of what I mean by \"tools\":\n\n-Lots of forgiveness. Actively speaking to myself in a kind, forgiving, compassionate way. It's important because forgiveness clears my energy and creates security in myself, which encourages me to risk trying things that might not work. Plus kindness is the nice thing to do. It's soothing. It's a way to parent myself through difficult feelings. If I do want to be mean to myself, I try to at least do it in a joking or ironic way to make myself laugh in the process. Laughter makes things seem less serious. But generally, I assume if I can't do a task that it means I am feeling vulnerable in some way and need soothing and compassion. I could speak to myself kindly or ask someone else for a hug or something like that.\n\n-Deciding a first action, setting a 5 minute timer, then acting once the timer goes off. It's like that \"countdown\" technique people use to get themselves moving, but with a longer range, to give the subconscious mind time to adjust to the idea. One reason to procrastinate can be a struggle with making transitions between different activities (changing from activity A to activity B). Giving myself a slower pace of change can help me with transitions sometimes at least. And making the signal external to me reduces the work my mind has to do. Often I am thinking \"do it now!\" and I don't act, in fact I feel I can't. But sometimes when the timer goes off 5 minutes after I decided my action, I can act. If not, I can set the timer 1-2 more times to see if it works then. If not, only 15 minutes have elapsed and I know that I tried to find a way out of being trapped and that because this didn't work, I can see that the problem is not going to be easily solved this time.\n\n-\"Wiggle your big toe\". It's a scene in the film Kill Bill where the character must get her legs to work, so she starts with intensive focus on one toe. Can't do a big movement like turning your whole body or sitting up? Try a small one.\n\n-Promise myself a reward and then give it to myself once I have done something. Even something small like putting on the lip balm could count if it's something difficult for you and if thinking about a reward for doing it helps you actually do it. Don't judge what you consider a reward, figure it out and accept it and work with it. (I am food motivated. I loathe the idea of leaving the house as a reward because it feels like a task in itself.)\n\n-Physically changing my location/movements while keeping my mind blank. Don't know why this works, but it does sometimes help me. For example, I was standing up staring down at a whiteboard, trying to get motivation to clean it so I could use it. But I just felt dread and reluctance. Then I made my mind blank, and just sat down next to the whiteboard, only seeing it through my peripheral vision. Pretty quickly, I felt a change internally. Suddenly the task felt doable and I got up and got going with it, no internal \"forcing\" necessary. If I need to clean, making my body just mindlessly pick things up and put them other places can actually get me into the right frame of mind to genuinely start cleaning. It's like, if figuring things out mentally isn't helping, then engage the body first!\n\n-Try and really dissect certain situations for what is creating discomfort, reluctance or dread. This might be extremely difficult (it is for me), so it's not somethingto push - but gently be aware of. For example, I realised I often don't leave bed because I dread being cold. It took me a long time to recognise that, even though it is simple. Judging that doesn't help me - wrapping up warmer while in bed in preparation to leave does. Underlying reasons can be much less obviously connected to problems, though. My therapist guided me through a decision making technique and it starts with \"feel and acknowledge\". Before deciding what you should do, perhaps try to understand yourself in that moment? Only after doing that can you negotiate between your wants and your needs. One way to cultivate awareness of this is to ask yourself whether anything negative has happened recently, that might be affecting your mood, energy or concentration in general. Because those things affect the decisions you make, if you are struggling in the afternoon and in the morning you argued with someone, the struggle might have little to do with the task and everything to do with the argument. Finally, deeper things like fears and insecurities can prevent action - in this case you cannot brute force a solution, but need a gentle set of steps to follow, or an alternative way of looking at the task so that it doesn't feel so scary and important.\n\n-That brings me to ask whether you have received any external support recently? It seems like some of the problems here are self-sustaining in the sense that you feel behind and unable to catch up, which would increase your worries and stresses, which would decrease what you can cope with. Perhaps someone else can help you see the situation in a different light that seems more manageable, could get you some supports so you're not facing it alone? \n\nThese things listed above are just possibilities. And, I am sorry I added much of my own experience - you are your own person and solutions will come from you, not from others. But I do know what it's like to go through this. I hope this post helps you a bit. Please let me know whether anything I said was unclear.",

No body knows why. I'm on the overweight side so Endocrinologists said that I need to loose weight to optimize my hormonal profile. My psychiatrists talked about watching porn and porn induced erectile dysfunction. Urologists don't have answers, for them I should proceed for implant surgery which other doctors are refusing since I'm not completely flaccid. Not before I solve my porn addiction and overweight problem.\n\nI tried hard loosing weight staying away from porn but everytime I fail, I get depressed and I become worse than before. I know some people my consider this nonesense but I always had problems with my self confidence and social anxiety. That was the final blow. Eventually my wife left me. that was 1 year ago. My depression starting reflecting on my behaviuor with her. I started treating her badly but i never hit her before you jump to conclusions. Although by the time she left me, I already had started seeing psychiatrists but she couldn't take it anymore. I love her so much. I want her back. She never did me any harm and I treated her badly. I want to fix myself but I don't know if I can do it or no.\n\nI need to become athletic to correct all my hormones which I never did in my life even as a kid I wasn't active.

I need to clean the house. Since my depression worsened my personal hygiene level has detriorated dramatically. I need also to study hard for an exam that I've been failing each year for the last 3 years. I need to quit watching porn. I need to quit staying glued to my phone screen for long hours. The older I get, the harder it gets to achieve anything.My work routine isn't regular which is another problem.

        "best_comment": "You're like that because no one has taught you how to clean. We aren't born knowing how to be tidy, we have to learn, so that's not your fault at all. Once you clean your house, It's mostly about maintaining that level through routines. I recommend unf*ck your habitat and the flylady for some simple routine building. \nTo get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it's really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash? You can start by sorting laundry into one place (can be a big corner pile even) to do a load a day until it's done, and a bag of trash on a timer a day. It didn't get messy all in one day, so you won't get it clean that fast either. But by taking small steps it can get better faster than you think. Good luck!",

I get so stressed I end up doing nothing, and am miserable every day due to all this stuff taking up my space. It's insanity",
        "gpt_comment": "To overcome the overwhelm associated with cleaning, break the task into smaller, more manageable parts. Schedule regular cleaning sessions throughout the week instead of one large cleaning day. Create a checklist of daily, weekly, and monthly tasks to provide structure and ensure consistency. Consider seeking help from a professional cleaner to get started, or use apps and online communities focused on home organization for tips and motivation. Remember, maintaining a clean home is a skill that can be developed over time with practice and patience."

      "title": "I'm so tired of procrastination and feeling like shit [Discussion] [Need Advice]",
      "body": "So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I will go into further details in this edit.\n\nSome comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\n\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\n\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\n\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\n\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\n\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\n\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.",

I tell my friend or family ‘I need to finish this task by this date, and I can do *this* as a reward’. Those people often don’t even need to check in on me, but the accountability to another is far more powerful than to myself. \nI also set timelines. “This research needs to be done by 10:00 on Tuesday.

        "gpt_comment": "Procrastination, especially from a young age, can become a deep-seated habit that affects various aspects of life, including academics and personal tasks. It seems like you've identified a pattern of relying on last-minute pressure to complete tasks. To address this, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps and set deadlines for these smaller tasks well before the final due date. Use a digital tool or app that blocks distracting websites during study hours. Also, try studying in a different environment, like a library or a study room, to mentally separate leisure and work activities. To address commitment issues with journaling or planning, try starting with a very simplified version, such as listing just three small tasks you want to accomplish each day and gradually build from there."

I’ve been like this since I can remember, only difference now is I have tools to help vent the frustration instead of just blowing up at everyone. \n\nBut I also utilise this Frustration Time to my advantage — I open up my computer and set up my To Do word document, and get my phone out and set it up so I can type up things from the notes app straight into my computer.

Now you’re already halfway there and your brain is probably already getting excited thinking about how it can better arrange the bookcase. \n\n***\n\nIf you can’t get into that headspace at all when you get home, try wandering around your house doing random tiny jobs.

Instead of trying to narrow your interests down to one, consider rotating them on a schedule that allows you to engage with each one regularly but not simultaneously. This can keep the novelty alive and prevent burnout. For each interest, set specific, small goals that are achievable within a short time frame, which will give you a sense of progress and accomplishment.

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance.

In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”\n\nLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/\n\nThere’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. \n\nAs always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!",

Start by simplifying your schedule to the bare essentials and prioritize tasks that have the most immediate deadlines. Use tools like timers and app blockers to minimize distractions during study times. Regular, short breaks during study sessions can help maintain focus and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Additionally, continuing therapy can provide support as you work through these challenges. It's important to communicate openly with your therapist about your struggles so they can tailor their approach to suit your needs."

        "best_comment": "Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a significant challenge with maintaining focus and motivation, which is affecting both your personal interests and academic performance. Here are several strategies you might find helpful to manage and improve your focus and discipline:\n\n1. Set Small, Achievable Goals: Break your tasks into very small parts and set achievable goals for each session. For example, instead of aiming to study for an hour straight, aim for 15 minutes of focused study, then take a short break. Gradually increase the duration as you build stamina.\n\n2. Create a Structured Schedule: Establish a routine that allocates specific times for different activities. Stick to this schedule as closely as possible to create a sense of normalcy and expectation.\n\n3, Use Timers: Employ a timer to help you stay on task. This could be through techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This method can help manage anxiety and prevent burnout by providing regular breaks and structured work periods.\n\n4. Change Your Environment: Sometimes, a change of scenery can help improve focus. If possible, try to study or work in different locations to find out where you feel most productive. This could be a quiet part of your home, a library, or a cafe.\n\n5. Limit Distractions: Before you start a work session, eliminate as many distractions as possible. This might mean turning off your phone, using apps that block distracting websites, or clearing your workspace to minimize clutter.\n\n6. Mindfulness and Meditation: Practice mindfulness or meditation to improve your ability to concentrate and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a significant difference in your mental clarity and stress levels.\n\n7. Physical Activity: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Exercise can help clear your mind, reduce stress, and improve your overall ability to focus.\n\n8. Reflect on Your Progress: Keep a simple journal where you record what you accomplish each day, no matter how small. Reviewing your progress can provide motivation and help you understand patterns or triggers related to your focus issues.\n\n9. Accountability Partner: Find someone you trust to act as an accountability partner. Share your goals and daily achievements with them. This could be a friend, family member, or even an online peer who has similar goals.\n\n10. Reward Yourself: Set up a reward system for meeting your goals. This could be as simple as allowing yourself to watch an episode of your favorite show after completing a set number of tasks or study sessions.\n\nWhile these strategies can help, it's also important to acknowledge when professional help might be needed, even if it's not immediately accessible. Look for online resources, community groups, or even telehealth services that might offer support at lower costs or on a sliding scale. Additionally, learning more about time management and cognitive techniques through free online courses or materials might also provide some useful tools for managing your challenges."

I don't like to think of these as excuses, but I do recognize they can make things difficult for me. I've just also never had self discipline. I don't want to sound snobby, but I've never had to try. I've had at least moderate success in just about everything I've tried, school included, though I've always had good grades. However, I procrastinate everything until the absolute last second, even if I know about it and don't mean to. I always mean to do things, my brain just... Kind of shuts down if I need to do tasks?

I just pretty much cram and skim until I find answers, and it's ALWAYS the day of the due date.

I think I huge reason why I repeat this behavior is because I still succeed. \n\nHowever. I want to get back into reading. I want to start editing videos again. I want to start eating healthier (Right now my main goal is to kick my binge-eating habit). And honestly I want to study. I want to be what I would consider a traditional student.

There's so many things I want to do, and I keep trying and failing. I need help and I just don't know what to do. \n\nThank you if you've read this far, sorry if it's disorganized at all it's past 4am and I haven't been able to sleep (Another thing I want to fix)",

        "best_comment": "Hello! First of all, I'm proud of you for making this far! It is amazing that you have accomplished so much with those two horses dragging you down! Congratulations! Really!\n\nSecond of all, asking for help is already another step foward. I also have depression and anxiety and I know how it is to have those blockdowns. That being said, how are you with social media? I found out that, for me, not having a time limit on instagram and tiktok made me scroll aimlessly between them until I feel too guilty to do anything. So what I did is that I put a time-limit on tiktok with a password and my bf set the password up, so I have no clue what it is. You could do something similar if you have someone you trust to set up a password for you. If you don't, you can always put the time limit yourself and it will, at least, make you remember that this is not good for you and you'll probably move on to do something better.\n\nWhen you are in a low moment of your life and just don't feel like doing nothing, choose a comfort movie for you and watch it. It requires no effort and, in the end, you will be feeling slightly better, maybe better enough to do one small taks like taking the garbage out. And this can become a snowball effect if you are in the mood: \"I already done this, so I can do that other slightly bigger thing now\" and so on.\n\nIn therapy, idk about you, but I sometimes hid what I was ashamed of concerning my behaviour so my therapist thought I was getting better. DON'T BE LIKE ME! Tell all the worse and the best things to your therapist!!! Only then change can get to you faster. You need to tell everything.\n\nConcerning the binge-eating, idk who does the shopping at you home, but if it is you, build up the strenght to simply not buy what you binge-eat. You could also try to replace the foods with popcorn (with little butter and a pinch of salt), that is healthier, or buy more fruits and have them already saved on the fridge sliced, so that you can binge eat those. One fruit that helps me a lot (since sometimes I just don't have the energy to slice fruit up) is grapes. I love those green grapes that are \"seedless\" and they only require you wash them before you eat, so I always buy a great amount of them and when I feel the urge to eat something bc I'm anxious I go to the fridge, grab them and there you go, eating but not those muffins I used to eat before. Nuts in general are also a good option, the thing is to control yourself to eat one at a time and not put a handful in your mouth.\n\nAnd finally, I know how you feel about wanting to do everything all at once and then getting frustrated because you can't. Try this: for this month, I want to get back to reading, so every week from now on I will choose a short story to read. If I manage to do so, I will get a book to read, and I will finish it until the end of the year (remember, set major goals that are volatile and with a large expiration date, only the minor goals within the major ones should be with an expiration date closer to you). To do so, you can say \"I will try to read at least one page before going to bed/after waking up/during lunch\". And you can adapt this scheme to any other goals you might have. Just remember, it is little penguin steps at a time, because if you set a goal that is minor, it is easier to go beyond that and you will feel amazing bc you did more than you have set to do. This won't happen if you set a major goal that is difficult to achieve right away.\n\n(Oh, and one more thing, if you are the competitive type, you can make a competition with yourself, like \"I dare myself to cut this whole watermelon and put it in the fridge before this podcast episode ends\" and  if you don't make it, you at least already started doing it, so you can set another challenge \"I will do this before the sun sets\" or something else you feel appropriate to you)\n\nI hope this all helps :)",

      "body": "I’m a 22yo female. Growing up, I loved learning. I was a branded as a ‘gifted’ child. I always worked so hard. After my GCSE’s, it felt like my ability to stay motivated started declining. I’ve now graduated from university and it’s a struggle to do anything. \n\nAs for background info, I was prescribed antidepressants 4 years ago. Over that time, I’ve tried different types and doses. I think the most recent change was about 2 years ago. My depression has definitely contributed to times of feeling lethargic and demotivated, but lately it feels different.\n\nAfter graduating last July, I had a few months break before getting a retail job to earn some money. I left at the end of January this year to take the time to apply for a masters course. Any time I felt drained, I assumed it was from being at work a lot or recovering from my retail routine, however, it’s now been months and I’m still struggling. \n\nI have a lot of hobbies. I get interested in something for a while and then move onto something new. Some stick, a lot don’t. Now, I can’t seem to do any of them. I have dreams and goals, but anything more than getting out of bed feels too difficult. I have a very imaginative mind, but I no longer feel like I have the motivation to put it to use. Occasionally, I’ll have a day where I manage to clean my whole room or go for a run, but soon I go back to how I felt before. Even small attempts to break the cycle don’t seem to work for me. If they do, I eventually go back to struggling with things like putting a sock in a drawer. It makes me angry, frustrated and I feel worthless.\n\nOrdinarily, I find it hard to accept that sometimes my mental health prevents me from doing things. I automatically think I am making excuses and that I’m using my depression as one. I even feel like I’m making my depression up at times and convince myself I am attention seeking. Now, it’s even worse and I can’t stop worrying that I’m using depression as an excuse for plain laziness. I’ve wondered if something like ADHD or bi-polar is responsible, but again, I feel I am looking for a reason to explain ordinary laziness. \n\nI often see things like ‘don’t demand too much of yourself’ and ‘it’s ok if all you did today was survive’ or ‘you are allowed to take a break’, but I tell myself that these don’t apply to me. I shouldn’t go easy on myself because I have no reason to be like this. I am just lazy and useless and it is my own fault.\n\nI just want to go back to feeling motivated and being productive. Or, at least, I want to feel less guilty about not being able to. I’d love any advice or reassurance - I think it would really help. Thanks :)",

        "best_comment": "It might be useful to understand how habits work.\n\nFor habits a few things that helped me were knowing:\n\n* They become automatic\n* They can be measured (using the Self Report Habit Index) and you should record them to help with adherence\n* They take longer than you think to establish (average: 66 days)\n* It's generally better to start one at a time (though there are exceptions)\n* They get harder before getting easy\n* Implementation Intention, forming a clear trigger, is really key\n* Mental Contrasting, planning for potential stumbling blocks is also a lab tested method of getting to a habit\n* Tiny Habits, starting ridiculously small UNTIL the habit forms up, THEN and only then expanding it, really helps avoid the tendency to quit after 2 or 3 weeks.\n* When forming they don't require a strict streak. So if you miss a day, remember that the habit is a deeper structure in the brain that is still forming. So be compassionate, pick it up tomorrow, and try not to make it a streak of missing the activity. Do not think you're starting from square one.\n\nSo right there you've got a good starting map. You might also think about how sleep works. Some things that helped me with my sleep issues were:\n\n* Figuring out the variables that had the most impact. For me that was light and caffeine.\n* Getting more light - especially 30 min as soon as I got up - significantly improved my sleep onset latency\n* Programming my phone helped as well. Blue light filters automatically go on, and I\"m seriously considering using the Bixby Samsung Routines app to just block all distracting apps at bed time.\n* Nighttime routines are great, but most people will formalize them by saying \"I'll do X BEFORE I go to bed\". That's not how habits work. You need a trigger first - so set one if you're going to make a nighttime habit.\n* Some great nighttime habits are alternative bridging activities that get you ready for bed. Journaling, stretching, light meditation, pranayama, creativity and art (non perfectionist, low stakes) works great for me.\n* I found that my natural wakeup time has more to do with what I did the day before. Focusing on getting that morning light and getting to bed on time helped make waking up early *solidly* solved, and not a matter of setting a bunch of stressful alarms, which is a topical solution.\n\nProductivity at work:\n\n* There's a lot here, but one thing that really helped me was understanding optimal work times. I highly recommend Cal Newport's book Deep Work.\n* He advocates really being strict by building up. Most people can't just jump into even a bit of deep work without strain.\n* Managing productivity is a whole thing unto itself. It's navigating the post lunch slump, knowing how, when, and what breaks to take. And it's knowing how to assign what KIND of task when - if you're tired, you probably don't want to be editing anything.\n* One of the best things that helped me was interspersing workouts with work. The optimal work:rest ratio is 52:17, which gives me enough time to do some micro workouts. Not only can you get a full workout in (and there are people talking about this is you look it up), but you energize yourself without tiring yourself out with a full separate workout habit. Behaviorally it also seems to lodge the workout habit (very quickly) in better because it's sandwiched between another structure of work. Obv, this depends on your work, but it's something to think about.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

If you have some inkling of different directions you'd potentially like to explore, I would bring these up as well as your concerns.  They may not have answers, but they potentially can point you in the direction of people who may be able to help you.  Another avenue that you might want to consider is the mental health counselors.  Most of the time they are free, and they can also assist you determine what goals are important to you and how you can go about achieving those goals while filtering out the stuff that isn't helping.  Another route that you could check out would be a mentor.  Some colleges have alumni in all walks of life who volunteer their time to help mentor current students.  They can give insight based on their experiences and help you to build out your network.  Your school may also have vocational tests available that you can take that might bring something to light that you hadn't considered in the past, and give you an opportunity to explore, also using the resources available at the school.\n\nAs for the RT program specifically, see if you can shadow at a local hospital in the various areas that your degree will apply to.  Being a radiology tech gives you a potential career path in a number of areas of the hospital that you may find interesting.  Some of the procedure areas, like Cath Lab, Interventional Radiology, Electrophysiology, Interventional Neurology, and Structural Heart (to name a few) employ RTs to assist the physician during the procedures.  Spending two or three hours shadowing and observing may give you a new perspective on your degree and help you find a more focused path to follow.  Or, it could end up definitively showing you that it's not the direction you want to go, which is also a good thing to find out.\n\nGood luck!",

      "body": "Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \"I didn't have much more to say\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\n\n**Two minors issues**\n\n* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \n \n\n**My two biggest issues**\n\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\" and the thought really really scares me.  \n \n* **Dating** \\--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \n \n\n**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",

Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit?

I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible.

Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid.

I was your typical student who got A's and B's up until my sophomore year in HS where I basically gave up on it. Grades dropped and did only the very bare minimum to breeze through with a low C. I eventually only graduated because of COVID when my HS put in some VERY lenient standards for its students (for example, there was nothing that could lower your grade in classes. Not doing homework? Not showing up to those zoom calls? Perfect, my C in that class would remain unchanged). Woohoo class of 2020.\n\nSkipped the fall 2020 semester at my local CC because of my laziness and irresponsibility to register early. I did my first semester in Spring the following year and failed all my classes. Now I just missed this year's fall semester again because of the same reason before.\n\nNow, I'm unemployed with no driver's license. I have my fourth try in a couple weeks (I failed twice for stupid mistakes, and I couldn't even take it the third because my brakelight went out).

Whatever it is there has to be real negative consequences if you don't show or if you call in sick. It'll get you going so the days don't just slide by. It is a huge boost to have people rely on you and to be contributing in a real way to helping other people succeed. Progressively adopt more and more responsibility. It changes everything. \n2. Definitely quit the porn and probably the video games. Too much easy dopamine. Dopamine is what will get you out of bed and looking for work, trying new things, meeting people, etc. You don't want to use all of it up on stuff that isn't moving you forward.\n3. You are on the right track with a predictable and consistent daily schedule and some fitness habits. That made a big difference. I'm just not sure I could have implemented this without also doing #1 above.\n4. As soon as possible, move out of your parents house.

But as typical of me, I've done nothing but put it off. \"O I'll start Tomorrow, today my study table is not in order\" then tomorrow comes and I put it off to the next. In doing so I kinda lost believe and faith in myself.\n\nI've basically wasted the last 6 years of my life. And I've gotten so accustomed to this current state of being--lazy, unmotivated, no plans, unemployed, obese, depressed,anxious--that any move towards a positive change scared me. Am afraid of change and what lies beyond. \n\nI know am supposed to be hitting the gym, I know am supposed to be ahead of the teacher, I know I should diet. But for some strange reason I can't move forward. It all sounds good in my head but I cant put it to action. its like am in invisible shackles.  So far am 20 chapters behind and we're in the final stretch of the semester and am still procrastinating.\n\nMy self sabotage is beyond belief. I know what am supposed to do and I know how guilty I would feel if i don't do it. But I still don't do what's required of me.  \nAlso I got an extreme 12hr/day phone addiction. And am currently afraid for my future. Will I be stuck for the next 6 years?\n\nAnd finally am afraid of what lies beyond, the uncertainty kills me. Am so deep into my comfort zone, which consists of nothing but bad habits,e.g in bed 24/7 with my phone glued to me. It feels like I've been stripped of my manhood. I'll always  choose the path of least resistance. \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.",

I don't have any friends so I need some advice on what to do for fun outside of my house on a weekend night. Normally I get into my bad habits at night where I would just watch youtube videos and play video games with some people that may be ok to do but for me, I think it leads to more bad habits that I have like masturbation and watching porn because I get too comfortable at home and therefore start doing bad habits at night and then it leads me getting discouraged because of what I did. My goal is to get out of the house until it gets too late outside, like I said I don't want to be at home and try to replace a bad habit with a good habit because I usually do my good productive habits outside of the home and I treat my home as a place to relax and be comfortable, but I get too comfortable to the point that I start watching porn and eating junk food.

No matter how hard I tried, it actually seemed to set my parents off faster. But its good you see it and want to change it, that's huge. So congrats on that part. In my adult life I refuse to argue with people, and by extension be yelled at or yell back and forth. If it's something that needs to be talked about, it will be talked about after both parties take a breather and are at the point of actually talking to each other. Until then, the subject needs to be left alone. If it's something that can be left as \"agree to disagree\" then sometimes that is best. It wasn't an easy learning process, but I've learned you'll say things while angry that you don't necessarily mean and then that festers until it gets brought up. Normally out of nowhere. Learning to deal with your emotions so They don't control you in certain situations would help. That would differ from person to person though. But thats what helped me, and ultimately helped with me choosing not to argue with people. What others still continue to try and do is nothing I can control, remember that.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I came to live with my husband over 12 years ago. We were still bf and gf back then. I came from a yelling-everything family and I brought the yelling in this household too. It wasn't always arguing, but simply different views. \n\nI am maybe lucky to have the partner I do, that kept calm and never yelled back. Took me years to unlearn the yelling after over 20 years of it being something normal. These last 2 years I can't remember yelling once, but I might remember smth before these 2 years. \n\nIt is an urge deep inside, but it comes easy with practicing few steps, especially when you are the one engaging someone else in conversation:\n\n1. Think of what you need to say and if it is actually important saying. Sometimes we act out of impulse, giving 0 thoughts to how this might carry on. \n\n2. Do you really need a feedback on something or you already know what's to be expected from the other person? In the intimacy of a family, you already know, from past emcounters what the other person wants or needs or what view has. Some questions make others wander if you are actually listening to them and it gets frustrating to know you pay no attention and, coming back to them with a similar situation or question, may fuel some negative feeling. This is why thinking on past situations might help. \n\n3. Know, before engaging with anyone in a conversation, that voices might be raised. Allow yourself to calm down first (because knowing what will come will give you a start-up of your own \"bubbling\" even before you say the first word). It is important to forgive the other person even before they yell at you. It is even best when you go into a conversation with this positive attitude and no one is yelling. For me, this was amazing. Now I rarely feel joy about it :) ...well, because no one is yelling anymore these days haha!\n\n4. Confirmation. This is important for a person that yells. Going into a conversation with this type of people (and I know, because I was one too) is to approve what they say if you indeed approve with them. This should be the only way to talk back to them before getting a chance to speek as well. Let them speak/yell what they need to \"let out\" and till they are finished, just tell them \" I agree with that view too\" (or something similar, depending what it is said), or even nodding helps, while they talk. This will defuse the state of mind they are in. When it is your turn to speak, start with letting them know you agree with what they said (it is even better if you actually say, word by word, what are you agreeing with), and then approach a different view ifbit is the case(smth like a question: \"what do you think if this happens\", \" I hear you and I think I need an advice if smth goes different, what should I do?\"). But!!! Sometimes is ok if you let a period of time to cool and come back to them and just telling them you thought of what they said and then start with agreeing with their view/perspective. Afterwords bringing up other things you need to follow up with. Giving them the feeling they are important in any matter of your life is something they find peaceful and they will be in a different set of mind. \n\nIn time, yelling family members will learn that they can talk to you in a different manner. They will come to you too and  the same \"lay-back\" situation you can apply. Even if they start yelling first and you don't have that thinking time ahead, you can just agree, trying to pay attention to the message itself and not letting your voice to get too high. You can actually ask them to let you think of what they ask you or tell you and reassure them that you will give your feedback. \n\nFor you, dear OP, it will be easier to change than for them. They did not thought of change as you did. Asking them now to stop yelling is an insult and I'm sure you don't want them feel like this. They will see, little by little that you'll yell less and less and that you listen more and maybe, one day, they will change too. \n\nI can report now that my relationship with my family is yelling-free. They yell at each other sometimes, but in relationship with me, because I sticked with my plan, they stopped. And OP,  it is such a beautiful thing to have this type of conversations, even if we disagree with each other, no more yelling 🥳\n\nYou have a long way ahead of you if, you want to start this process. Think that it is possible, but allow it to get fixed in years too. It is not a \"out of nowhere\" thing. \n\nPlease remember to be kind to yourself first of all. The way you described things I do too think that they love you and not everything that they yell is meant to harm you (actually nothing is). Listen to the message, not the voice. \n\nI hope this works out for you and your loved ones :) because one day, dear redditor, you will feel as I do and I promise, it is SO WORTH IT! \n\nI wish you best of luck and a happy life! 😇✌",
        "gpt_comment": "Breaking the cycle of yelling inherited from family dynamics involves developing new communication strategies and often, professional guidance. First, recognize triggers that lead to yelling and actively work on maintaining composure during these moments. Practice deep breathing or stepping away from the situation temporarily. Communicate your efforts to your family, and suggest implementing \"cool-off\" periods during disagreements. Consider seeking family therapy to develop healthier communication habits and address underlying issues contributing to the yelling."

I’m 24 y/o and never went through high school.\n\nI grew up in a Christian homeschooled household and to make a very long story short, since middle school my parents never kept me accountable with my school work. I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off. That coupled with my parents never checking up on how I was doing/if I was completing my schoolwork, my education just slipped through the cracks. I started working and moved out when I was 17.

I honestly don’t remember what grade I got to in school before I dropped out, I’m assuming 6th or 7th. \n\nNow that I’m nearing my mid twenties I’m realizing I’d like to go to college in spring of 2024 but I have no idea where to even start.

I have a hard time dealing with stress, and it is heavily affecting my work life. Since elementary school, I have been very depressed and I guess my defense at that time was to give up and shut down. Now that I’m an adult that just can’t work anymore. I have trouble holding down a job because when something tough hope s, I get so stressed out and I shut down.

I’ve gotten really sick when thinking about going to work or if something stressful happens at work and my Systolic BP went dangerously high. \n\nIt affects my self worth, and confidence. I have a very hard time supporting myself, and my wife struggles a lot to financially support me when I get fired or quit. I’ve been hospitalized over psychosis from breaking from stress. But the worst part is that I know the jobs I do would be mild-mid stress level for most people but it just overwhelms me . I’ve been trying different antidepressants and anxiolytic medicines, and still attend therapy, but it doesn’t help me enough to function more than a year (if that) in a “real job”\n\n\n\nAnd another thing I would love some direction in is validation seeking. I have such low self image and self worth that I’m always seeking validation from others. I try to show off stupid things that I admit are somewhat impressive the first time but I can’t help but keep prompting validation from others. Due to my mental health issues, I have lost contact with a lot of friends as I reclused myself. And now I’m so desperate for human interaction that people I meet can feel it I think.

        "best_comment": "I am sorry to hear that you’re dealing with such difficulties. Dealing with anxiety and depression is a real bitch. Like you, I have dealt with anxiety and depression for a majority of my life. I have spent thousands of hours in therapy, tried different medications, treatment methods, all with varying results but the one constant in my life seems to be the depression and anxiety. \n\nNot unlike you, I grew up in an unstable environment, I never really felt comfortable or safe at home, school or anywhere really. I was constantly on edge, almost always in fight-or-flight mode. I constantly worried about what in my environment might hurt me and looked for ways I could find refuge or relief. I internalized all of these feelings and as I grew up I continued to deal with it on my own by withdrawing into myself and shutting down when things got overwhelming. \n\nI believe the self-doubt, insecurity, anxiety, and depression are the result of my experiences growing up and how I chose to deal with them, along with a sprinkling of genetic predisposition, of course :)\n\nFast-forward to today, not much has changed in how I deal with my experiences and feelings. That’s where the problem lies. I continue to work with a therapist and try different treatment methods, but it continues to be a long and difficult journey. Changing habits that have been engrained in your brain over many years, habits used to protect yourself (often successfully) from the outside world, is a complicated and arduous process. It is certainly doable, but it will not be easy. \n\nI have made notable progress with my mental health in the past couple of years but recently I have been struggling so forgive me for the length of this comment; writing this feels therapeutic for me. Although I do not have an exact answer for you on where to get started or how to make an immediate impact on your mental health, I can spout off a few thoughts that have helped on my journey:\n\nIf nothing else, It is important to always keep in mind that the journey to the promised land of mental well-being is not a linear progression, there will be many ups and downs. Keep going through difficulties. \n\nWhile it is important to persevere through difficult times, it is equally important to recognize when something is not working for you. Knowing when it is the right time to change course and try something new is a difficult question to answer, especially when you’re already full of self-doubt, but only you can decide to keep trying. \n\nThat said, it is immensely helpful to have someone that you can talk to and to hold you accountable, be it a therapist, partner, family member, or friend. Find someone that you can trust, to be open and honest with so that you can honestly discuss your problems and get help when you need it. \n\nStrive to be radically honest with yourself and with others. You will not change unless you are honest with yourself about what needs to change. This goes for dealing with your therapist or someone who is helping and holding you accountable: they cannot help unless you are being honest, even when it hurts. \n\nI hope this helps. I feel better for writing my thoughts out. Thank you for sharing yours.",

        "gpt_comment": "The quest for self-worth and reducing validation seeking starts with internal work. Therapy is a good foundation, but also consider activities that build self-esteem independently of others' approval, such as volunteering, hobbies, or learning new skills that provide intrinsic satisfaction. Mindfulness and meditation can help center your thoughts and reduce the impulse to seek external validation. Gradually, try to shift your focus from external validation to recognizing your own accomplishments and values."

In fact I've done just that before.\n\nI realize it will ultimately come to \"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\" which is fine.

      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "Here’s the thing - it’s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that’s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here’s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

Once you get into your 40s and especially your 50s you realize that all of those milestones are not as important as they seemed in your 20s. Everybody’s life has a different path and while others may be hitting certain milestones those may not be your milestones. You’ll achieve other milestones that are important for your life. And when you reach your 40s and 50s you’ll realize that the only thing that’s really important is that you’re happy. You’ll realize that a job that you enjoy is the most important thing because living your entire career for Fridays and holidays and vacation days is a horrible way to live. And I know because I did that for 26 years. Find some thing you love that doesn’t make you dread Sunday night because you know Monday’s coming and you don’t live for days you don’t have to go to work. Find friends that are loyal and true that you can completely be yourself with, your quirky, weird side no one really gets to see. And if you’re creating a bucket list of things you’d like to do don’t wait, go do them right now. Because you don’t know what 20 or 30 years down the line in your life will look like. And I know because at 50 I became disabled. And now I cannot accomplish many of the things that were on my bucket list. I hope somehow this was helpful. But just judge your life by how you feel and not what everyone else is doing. And the things you don’t get done today, they will still be there tomorrow to finish. Be kind to yourself. And if the panic attacks continue please talk to your doctor. You don’t really realize how severe they are until you stop having them. Also try some meditation and some yoga.

Even if you're not depressed, the same methods he teaches can be used to handle these thoughts. A lot of his methods are about handling automatic negative thoughts.\n\nYou can talk back to the thoughts:\n\n\"Thank you, brain! Thank you for sharing!\" (from a video link somebody posted on this subreddit in the last few months) while smiling and then ignoring it\n\n\"What if it doesn't?\"\n\n\"What about the 999,999 people that isn't going to happen to?\" (The what-if generating part of the brain doesn't tend to be impressed by logic, the word \"not\", or small probabilities, though; it's more into pictures, associations and emotions. So this kind of reasoning might not help much but it doesn't hurt.)\n\n\"There's a thought. OK. Right now is the time for sleeping. Tomorrow at 10AM I'll sit down with paper and pencil and work out whether there's any action to be taken on that.\" (After a few days, if you really do sit down and work things out, even if it's to write \"no action required\", your brain tends to learn to trust that and sleep.) Keep a pad of paper beside the bed to write down a couple of words as a reminder when any concerns pop up.\n\nTaking action on your concerns, for example suggesting to your father not to yell; learning not to yell yourself, etc. can help calm these thoughts down (I think -- or does it encourage them?)\n\nOften when we worry, it's our subsconscious trying to distract us from our real concerns. Think about what you're really supposed to be taking action on now -- Income tax forms? Studying for a test? etc. -- and take some action every day on those things. Then the subconscious won't need to think up worries to distract you.\n\nI find it helps to take a few minutes just before going to sleep, to meditate and clear the mind. Rather than thinking about something, by having an empty mind, it allows any deeper worries to come up and also be calmed and set aside. Otherwise, when I start to fall asleep, I stop thinking about whatever I was thinking about, and then the deeper worry steps in and wakes me up.",

If you find that you're losing interest quickly, it might help to set specific, short-term goals within your hobbies to achieve a sense of accomplishment that encourages continued engagement. Also, consider whether external factors like peer influence or changing life priorities might be affecting your interests."

      "body": "I’m destroyed my life\n\nI’m 23 now and I’ve destroyed my life. I got out of college and went to a party school right out of high school(I had no friends in hs and I was a loser) rushed a top ranked sorority and started going out every night( I ended freshman year with a 1.0 gpa) I did better my second year but my parents caught me smoking and made me drop out of college and move home. I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.\nI got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn’t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I’ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I’m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don’t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I’ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy. I have no friends, ive gained a ton of weight and all I do is work and do hw(it’s undergrad hw idk why its so hard for me to complete) and cry. I’m going to graduate soon (maybe) and I have about 30k debt: with the expulsion and the dui, the chances of getting into a masters program or a higher paying job is slim. I have about 30k in student debt and I have no car. If I get a car and insurance it will be 900 a month just insurance, I have no support system and live with my parents who hate me. I work remote and 7 days a week so everyday I wake up to the hellacious nightmare of the same reoccurring day. I want to kill myself, I work a call center job and I’m never going to get out. I’m too old for things to change, everyone has a partner and I lost the only person who cared about me. I tried dating again and it wasn’t the same. I’ve tried making new friends but no one really likes me, I’ve been in therapy for 7 years. Nothing changes, I should end it.",

        "gpt_comment": "I’m sorry to hear about the intense challenges and setbacks you've faced. It sounds like you've been through a tremendous amount of stress and heartache. While your situation feels overwhelming, it's important to recognize the resilience you've already shown by continuing your education and maintaining employment despite these hardships. Here are some strategies that might help you find some stability and start rebuilding:\n\n1. Continuing Therapy: It's great that you've been in therapy for several years. If you feel it hasn't been effective, it might be beneficial to discuss this with your therapist or consider seeking a different therapist who might offer new approaches or perspectives. Sometimes a fresh approach can make a significant difference.\n\n2. Building a Support System: While making new friends can be challenging, consider joining clubs, groups, or online communities that align with your interests. These could be academic groups, hobby-based communities, or local meetups. Connections can take time to develop, but shared activities can provide a natural foundation for friendship.\n\n3. Financial Management: With your financial concerns, including student debt and the potential cost of a car, it may help to consult with a financial advisor or explore financial counseling. Some universities offer free financial planning services for students and alumni. They can offer guidance on managing debt, budgeting, and planning for financial independence.\n\n4. Career and Academic Advising: Since you're concerned about your academic record affecting future opportunities, speak with a career counselor at your university. They can assist you in identifying paths forward in your career or further education, even with a complex history. They can offer strategies for addressing these issues in applications and interviews.\n\n5. Physical and Mental Health: Addressing your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental well-being. Simple activities like regular walks, yoga, or other forms of exercise can reduce stress. Also, consider nutritional counseling to support your physical health, which can be interconnected with mental health.\n\n6. Mindfulness and Stress Reduction: Techniques such as mindfulness meditation, breathing exercises, or yoga can help manage stress and improve your mental state. Many resources are available online that can guide you through these practices.\n\n7. Gradual Changes: Focus on making one small change at a time rather than overhauling your life all at once. This could be as simple as setting a goal to complete one homework assignment on time or to make one positive interaction each day.\n\n8. Exploring Creative Outlets: Since you’ve expressed creativity in the past, reconnecting with creative activities like drawing, writing, or music can provide a therapeutic outlet for your emotions and stress.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that despite feeling stuck now, you are still very young and have many years ahead to create a different life for yourself. Each small step you take can lead to changes and eventually to a vastly different place. If you are having thoughts of suicide, it is important to speak to a professional immediately. Suicide is a permanent decision to a temporary problem and there are always other solutions available. If you ever feel overwhelmed or unable to cope, please reach out to a mental health professional or a crisis hotline in your area immediately. Your life is valuable, and there is hope for a better future.'"

      "body": "Where do I begin?\n\nI'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\n\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)\n\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \"career\" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\n\nI forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.",

        "best_comment": "First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \n\n\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \n\n\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \"!?!\" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \n\n\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \n\n\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \n\n\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \n\n\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \n\n\nIf you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \n\n\n3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \n\n\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \n\n\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \n\n\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \n\n\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.",

Job Applications: Broaden your job search beyond retail by considering other entry-level positions in areas like hospitality, administrative support, or other fields that often have higher turnover and more openings.\n4.

When you're feeling lost you're actually casting judgment on the world and your life, you're interpretating things in a way that doesn't point forward anymore.  Don't cling too tightly to any self definition or sense of ego if you start to regain it, you're always changing.\n\nI would advise you to lead with your heart instead of your head. If you've struggled with these things for a while, coming to the very true realization that our perception of the world is fallible and learning to rely on a sense of community/interconnectedness, and an acceptance of paradoxes for this reason is important. \n\nFeeling lost/like life is meaningless is actually our rational brain's attempt at understanding the world as a constant framework. Rather than seeking a constant (which you will never find) you can move forward in a way that never demands it, but is still positive (this is how we all were as kids, where we decided we didn't know enough about how the world worked yet).

      "body": "I often procrastinate with my assignments out of fear, I find myself doing anything possible to avoid the task at hand because it’s too daunting so I wait until the clock is shoving me to start the work, days before the deadline which never goes well because it’s just sleep deprivation and mental breakdowns.\n\nThe 5 second rule doesn’t even work for me because my head knows I’m trying to trick myself, my brain has also gotten so good at rationalizing and reasoning my avoidance behaviors that I don’t even really feel guilty in the moment for not doing the work like I used to. It feels like I have reached new heights with procrastination and can’t seem to avoid it, it’s probably the worst it’s ever been. \n\nAnother thing to note is that I really struggle to sit at my desk with my computer. Even when I force myself to sit at my desk to start my work (sometimes even being in tears out of sheer fear) I get started on the work but the slightest inconvenience like struggling to find a file or waiting for a software to open gets me distracted and before I know it I’m back in bed avoiding the task. If I somehow manage to start the task because I have everything set up and it’s going smoothly my body literally will make me feel the need to shit, pee, get thirsty, feel cold/hot just so I can have an excuse to get up and delay the task more.\n\nIt usually ends decently I’ve never failed an assignment but have gotten a passing grade once as a result of procrastination so it always feels like I can get away with it. Im not bad at the school either the work I do is usually of good standard after all this so sometimes it really really bugs me knowing how much better I could do when I don’t get the high grade I want or knowing how I could have gotten this grade minus the breakdowns and hits to my mental health if I managed my time better. Every time I don’t get the grade I want I also get very easily discouraged and just think that I’m either just dumb or bad at the work that it hinders my potential or any chance of really trying.\n\n If anyone has this same issue and can help with any advice or suggestions please feel free.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

I would say, as someone who is 33, that the importance of trying to address this ASAP can't be understated. Synapses that fire together wire together, so the longer this happens the harder it is to break - so treat it as important as that. \n\n  \nI read several books saw alot of therapists, yada yada - what really spoke to me was atomic habits. And basically what he preaches is measurement and incremental improvement. This isn't going to change overnight. Nothing I say, or anyone says, is going to make this go away tomorrow its a process at getting 1% better everyday. What I do is journal in the morning, make intention just write out all my thoughts, write my todo list and do journaling checkins at 2PM, 5PM, 8PM. When you fail at some of the todo list items, like writing your paper, try to ask yourself why. Study yourself, figure out how you could have made it gone differently? Could you have started with an outline, that slowly progressed? Could you have worked with another person? Write that as the test for tomorrow, and then try that. When that fails, keep trying. **Eventually** you'll find something that works for you. And you will relapse into another rut, what matters is not failing at a task, its showing up consistently with the process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are also therapists, coaches, doctors, etc. What I would say about medication is try to use it as a crutch with the intent of just supporting the healthy habits and getting off at some point but to each his own.",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like your fear of assignments has become a significant obstacle, leading to procrastination and distress. One strategy to consider is breaking down each assignment into smaller, manageable tasks and setting clear, achievable deadlines for each one.

Additionally, try to create a structured routine and a pleasant workspace that minimizes distractions. For the emotional distress you experience, it may be beneficial to seek support from a counselor or therapist who can help you develop coping strategies for anxiety and procrastination.

I don’t hold any resentment.\n\nHaving said this, I’m now becoming very aware of the influence they had on me. I come from a very low income family (multi generational poverty) and I am struggling to break through the conditioning. I see others in my family succumbing to it, and it’s scary. My favorite cousin is looking at serious prison time through a series of completely preventable situations because he’s not aware of how influenced he is. \n\nIn my early 20’s if I hated a job, I would just quit. I was taught that “others” are the problem. I thought this was completely normal. I was discouraged from attending college. When I attended anyway and wasn’t doing well (had a toddler and was a single mom) I was encouraged to quit and “be a mom” instead. I was told college is for rich white kids and I was already too smart to need it. I listened. \n\nGrowing up, I never witnessed anyone succeed at anything. My family was chronically homeless, in debt, and with gambling issues. I’m not just talking about my parents either. We moved around constantly due to evictions. My parents moved from job to job. They never had goals, were never financially secure, and in some cases dissuaded me from auditioning for things or joining teams at school because they didn’t want the additional expense. \n\nI was wildly naturally talented with zero support. I moved in with a friend in high school because my parents moved to another city and I loved the teams I was on and didn’t want to quit. Her family had money and I’m so grateful they helped support me.\n\nFast forward to my 30s. I have a good career, a loving partner, and my son has done well. Yet I cannot shake the urge to flee when things get difficult. I never realized it was unusual until now.

By being aware, you already won 50% of the battle. When you feel like you're spiraling, double down in your self care, and remember that you have choice. And you can choose to be brave and know that your feelings may not reflect reality. You can choose to address intergenerational trauma head on. And in doing so you're setting an incredible example for your family. I don't think there's actually a way to never have the negative feelings come back, only empower yourself with the tools/ therapy to pull yourself out. And then over time, it gets easier. At least this has been my experience.",

        "best_comment": "I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.\n\nIn my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

I only need to lose about 25 pounds but its been tough. For context I also work a semi stressful job that usually leaves me feeling emotionally drained by the end of the workday. \n\nRecently I read Atomic Habits, and it really helped me set small goals that I've been very consistent with. The issue is that I feel like im losing all the things that made me happy and I just feel miserable despite making good progress on my goals. I love going out for food and I enjoy having some wine after work and with dinner to wind down. My new routine doesn't really allow for these things as I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit. I still allow myself to have these things but in moderation, so think twice a week or so. \n\nWhen I resist the temptation to go out for food or get alcohol I don't feel happy about it, I just feel annoyed that I cant do the thing that makes me happy. When I cave and do these things anyways I feel happy in the moment but then feel bad about it after. Being in a caloric deficit also make tired and cranky overall so most days after work I just feel tired and drained and I don't feel like I even enjoy my hobbies anymore.\n\nIs this a normal adjustment to a new routine?

      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "This has been me for years and I think I’ve finally found a way to overcome this. As far as my story goes, I had a traumatic brain injury 12 years ago, followed by trauma with friends, family, roommates, employers… the whole shebang. But I’m an engineer, so I’ve spent the last 12 years trying to find a solution to all of my issues. Obsessed with it really. If you want tips on other approaches to handling trauma, like mindsets, routines, supplements, or life style, you can DM me and I’d be happy to offer some simple, small steps you could take to help in those areas too. \n\nBut as far as the one thing that finally helped me get out of bed and stop playing minesweeper for hours on end is massaging my body. This relieved the build up of tension in my body, which eased the tension in my mind. \n\nThis might sound antithetical to fixing your thoughts, but despite everything I’ve tried this is the biggest thing that’s calmed my thoughts. It makes perfect sense to me why it works too, but unfortunately it isn’t used a whole lot in the western world’s counseling. It’s picking up, but it’s still in its infancy. \n\nAnyway, the body and the mind are one thing: the brain and the nervous system. You notice how when you get nervous you tense up? Or when you get angry you have this build up of energy that makes you want to punch something? Or when you’re shy you just want to curl up in a ball? This is your mind telling your body how to react to these emotions… how to handle the energy behind these emotions… to release the build up of energy (anger) or to preserve the little energy you have left (exhaustion). \n\nBut the nervous system is a two way street. Just as the mind can tell the body how to behave, the body can tell the mind how to behave. \n\nTrauma is a psychological condition that affects our entire nervous system. This explains the cramp you feel in your stomach. Our nervous system is what’s responsible for all of our organs. It’s what relays messages from the mind to your stomach to tell you you’re full, for example. So the traumatic thoughts you’re having and the tension you feel in your body are one illness. Helping one helps the other. \n\nAs for how to massage, here’s my routine. I like doing things bottom up, step by step, but you can do it in whatever way feels comfortable for you. If my description is too much for you right now that’s ok, just start with the first one and you can slowly work in the other ones later at whatever feels comfortable for you. \n\nIf you have a massage ball or anything you can roll on your skin that would help too, but it isn’t needed.  Some important notes are included. \n\n1. Feet. Start here. They have over 2000 nerves and are an important player in releasing tension. They’re what ground us to this planet and are what support our entire structure. \n\n2. Slowly work you’re way up each leg. You can do one at a time or both, it doesn’t matter. \n\n3. Once you’re up to the thighs, play close attention to your inner thighs. The sacral nerve is here and it’s a very important nerve to massage. It’s a main nerve that’s responsible for your bladder and rectal muscles. Massage will  especially help if you have diarrhea or constipation. \n\n4. Slowly work your way up the side of your torso and gently massaging your abdomen. Massaging your sides will help calm your vagus nerve, which is a main nerve responsible for digestion, heart rate, and immune system. Likely responsible for your stomach issues. \n\n5. Arms. Start by placing your hands on the opposite shoulder and giving yourself a hug. Give just a gentle squeeze and slowly work your way down your arms, to your wrists, and back up again. Do this a couple times if it feels comfortable and end by massaging the back of each shoulder. The gentle hug isn’t only good for your nervous system, but your psyche as well, often bringing us back to memories of being loved as a little kid, and receiving protection. \n\n6. Massage the sides of the neck. The vagus nerve runs through here and is a good spot to massage. \n\n7. The head. Slowly start from the bottom, working your way up to your scalp. The jaw often holds a lot of tension for a lot of people and is a really good spot to focus on. If you have real vagus nerve issues like I do, the ear area is a really good spot to focus on too, specifically the left ear. It’s where the nerve starts. Be gentle here. The ear:\n1. Massage above the ear, gently moving the skin in whatever way feels comfortable. \n2. Place your finger in the ridge of your lobe, just gently moving around. It doesn’t take much movement here. \n3. Place your pinky finger inside your ear and very gently push against the back of your ear. \n\nYou can finish massaging your scalp and you’re done! \n\nNotice how your thoughts are now. They should likely be much more relaxed. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions if you have any.",

If for you that's a job, then apply to at least three-four jobs a day. No matter how shitty you feel while you're doing it(I know it can feel really intimidating), do it anyway. It may only take an hour or two. When you're done, not only can you acknowledge that you did something incredibly substantial in a short amount of time, you've just improved your chances of getting a job you want. If you want to go really hard, add on top of that--you have to cold-email/message someone at a company you want to work for. Do that, and you're a god.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep a calendar in your room, and every time you finish your step for the day, cross off a date. Do everything you can to not break your chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to hold this practice when doing something difficult for me--I count down from ten, and by the time I reach 0, I have to start the task. This gets rid of the anxiety associated with starting in the first place. This applies to social situations too--I count down from 5, and by the time I reach zero, I have to go interact with whoever I have to, whether that be a stranger, a cashier, or a long-time friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen doing all of this stuff, it's okay to sometimes struggle through the tasks. Starting and showing up are more important. HOWEVER, IMO it's never okay to not believe in yourself. When you're filling out job applications, know that one day, you will get the job you're looking for. That doesn't mean never learn from mistakes, that means have faith in the process of progress. Small steps lead to big changes over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. I'd recommend starting by doing something simple now, *right now*, like making your bed. See what difference it makes over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, don't let the label of NEET define you. Yes, you are a 'NEET' right now. But tell yourself that you only need to take more chances. Being a NEET doesn't mean you can't succeed, and don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You need to get lucky. But luck comes to those who search for it. If you try enough times, even if your success is 1 in 100, you'll  likely get it after 100 tries.",

I'm not asking what it says on the thermostat, but instead what it actually is inside the house. You may consider raising the temperature a little.\n\nSecond, light is important. People design their offices for low energy and for being sleepy. Put in 100 watt natural daylight LED bulbs in your office space. You should have 2 or 3 of them. Turn up your monitor brightness. You might even consider putting your lights on a timer. I have the lights in my bedroom come on automatically right after 7:00. Again, I am using natural daylight hue and I have the brightest LED panel fixture I could get. When the lights come on, it's a bright sunny day. The light helps you to wake up.\n\nThird, make sure you are getting decent sleep. You need to eat your meals and go to bed then get up at a consistent time every day - even the weekends. You want to aim for 8 hours.\n\nThere are a few other things.  A light, protein and fiber heavy meal first thing in the morning with a bit of coffee will really get you going. I'm talking 200 calories or less - something like a hardboiled egg, a protein bar, some lunchmeat, something like that. Absolutely no sugar or carbs though unless you want to have a blood sugar crash later.\n\nIt sounds to me also like you are having some dry skin issues. After showering, I would recommend slapping on some moisturizer. Use something water based. Apply daily everywhere, then to the exposed surfaces a few more times through the day, and to your hands after each time you wash them.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "In addition to the temperature and lighting mentioned by other posters, consider taking vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency can make you tired and is usually worse during the winter. \n\nI'd also recommend getting checked for basic vitamin levels and thyroid etc by your doctor because your fatigue seems to be impacting your daily life. They can give you more specific recommendations and make sure you don't go overboard.",
        "gpt_comment": "Your difficulty maintaining wakefulness during the winter might be influenced by the reduced daylight and colder temperatures, which can significantly affect mood and energy levels. To help manage this, consider using a light therapy lamp to simulate sunlight, which can improve mood and energy. Establishing a consistent daily routine, including regular sleep times and a structured work schedule, can also help regulate your body's clock. If wearing layers is uncomfortable, try using a space heater in your workspace or heated clothing that offers temperature control without bulk. Addressing the physical discomfort with hypoallergenic materials might also help alleviate irritation."

This was initially supposed to be submitted in May, but I got an extension as I could not submit it at the time. My grandmother, my parents and sister all got covid, and given everything that has been happening, I couldn't focus on any of my academic submissions.

Neither did I have the motivation to, nor the willpower. I have also been having suicidal thoughts since the last 6 months, and I know that I am not okay.\n\nYesterday, I saw a lot my batchmates post on social media about their online graduation and that they finished their degree and I have been anxious ever since about failing now.\nOur college won't provide the option of taking a break year and continuing, nor will I have support from my family, so I have to finish this, no matter what.

If your mind refuses to focus, do some exercises for 5 minutes - it will increase blood flow and the brain can actually burn lactic acid for energy. Edit: the brain doesn't burn it, it actually triggers norepinephrine, which is a hormone that encourages focus, affects our stress response, improves memory, and relates some bodily functions that can become distractions (bathroom, hunger).

      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "This kind of change generally requires two types of discipline. You'll need to consistently get up early, but you'll also need to consistently go to bed early.\n\nMost adults need to consistently get 7 or more hours of sleep per night. It's not unusual for someone to need 8-9 hours of sleep to feel fully rested. If you start getting less sleep than usual because you're waking up at 5 am without going to bed earlier, it's very likely to cause problems. Feeling tired during the day is just one of them. Lack of sleep may impact your mood, decision-making skills, creativity, and other abilities.\n\nIt can also be difficult to sleep well if you make a big change to your sleep schedule all at once. You might be more successful if you shift your sleep schedule 15 minutes at a time over a period of days until you're waking up as early as you want.\n\nIt also helps to keep a consistent sleep schedule. It will probably be easier to wake up consistently at 5 am if you're on the same sleep schedule every day, instead of only waking up early on certain days. It's not a problem to stay up a bit late or sleep in every once in a while, but a consistent sleep schedule tends to be easier to maintain.",

Try going to bed 15 minutes earlier each night and waking up 15 minutes earlier each morning until you reach your desired wake-up time. Also, prepare your gym clothes and essentials the night before to minimize morning hurdles. Lastly, consider the motivation of feeling energized for the day ahead as a key benefit of your morning workout, which might help you persist through the initial adjustment period."

I still want to lose weight and get fit, if necessary by other means, but I do not have the energy to carry out extensive internet researches for plans, apps and guides.

Over the last year I lost that extra weight and built up muscle due to regular exercise. I go for a 1h swim six times a week nowadays, but at the start I was barely managing 20 minutes and swimming less then 0,5 km. I swim 2,7km in 1 hour now. \nI'm also off anti-depressants now and I am in the best shape of my life (though I'm not done yet). \n\nMy advice? Start exercising now. Do whatever you can, and do as little or as much as you can.\n\nDon't feel like running? Walk.\n\nCan't walk much? Then walk for 5 minutes.\n\nDo crunches or push-ups at home. Can't do more than one? Then just do the one.\n\nWhatever you do and no matter how little you do, just do it, and do it everyday. This alone will make you feel better.\n\nDon't push yourself too hard, though. You will fail if you try to run marathons now. \nAim to run marathons in a couple of years. \nBe patient with yourself. \nBe kind to yourself.\n\nAnd if you can, seek professional help.

Your pleasure seeking self has some control, your lazy self has some control, you all have some control together.\n\nIt's important to create feedback loops. There is a 100% chance that you won't get everything right on your first try. Therefore create mechanisms to constantly correct your plans. There are PDCA cycles, there is scrum, there is journaling.

        "gpt_comment": "Balancing a demanding schedule with exercise is challenging but doable. Since you enjoy exercising at home, consider integrating short, high-intensity workouts that can be more effective and less time-consuming. Also, try to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine in other ways, such as taking short walk breaks during your study sessions or practicing stretching exercises. On extremely busy days, even 10-15 minutes of physical activity can be beneficial and help maintain your exercise habit."

Not saying you have ADHD or Anxiety just that this is like default operating mode with ADHD and sometimes anxiety, also similar to the patterns in being addicted to something.\n\nProblem is, you probably do know how to change your mind and start doing these things, it’s just that some base level networking in your brain is telling you ‘that will take too long to feel good, so do THIS which will make you feel good right now’ and you’re LETTING it run your life, at least for now. \n\nIt’s not like you’re gonna wake up tomorrow and change it all, but based on a pretty simplified understanding of how brains work; the more you do one thing, the more your brain gets wired to do it. So just start small, be willing to FORGIVE yourself when you fuck up, and remember that it takes time to accomplish any goal. It wouldn’t be a ‘goal’ if you could just do it right now and be done with it. \n\nBased on that, the best course of action IMO is to accept “yes I’m addicted to shit I don’t like, and I want it to change, but it’s not gonna happen overnight, so I’ll start small”. So if you’re 100% stuck doing the things you don’t like today, tomorrow try and force yourself to do 5% of the things you want to do, and accept that you’ll probably do 95% tiktok and time wasting. Then work towards 10%. Then 20%, and so on and so forth. Overtime, you’ll start building some fucking discipline and drag yourself out of the dopamine seeking hellhole that it sounds like your living in. \n\nIt’s great to aim high over the long term, and maybe you will get there, but for the short term, lower your expectations, and aim for mediocrity, then once you’ve gotten there, start aiming a bit higher each time, just slowly increasing your ability to sustain motivation, determination, and focus at a pace that is OK FOR YOU! Everyone is different, so don’t worry about how long it takes you, just take things one day at a time, or even one hour at a time, and chip away at using video games and tik tok slowly. Just remember those things have no ‘tangible gains’ they are all just fleeting moments of distraction and contentment, just temporary distractions from feelings of unhappiness and lack of content with life. \n\nWhen I wanted to turn off the world around me, I would get high, turn to the bottle, blast the music, just to temporarily feel good so I could ignore alll the things that made me feel bad. It’s been nearly 4 years since then, and I still have shitty coping mechanisms to ignore the things I’m not working on and know I need to be, but overtime I’m getting better at it, and maybe somewhat closer to letting any joy in life slip entirely through my fingers.",

Got less than average grades. Couldn't get accepted in a good college. And had to study for my first year of college by MYSELF and give exams as an individual privately, which is an option for failures like me. I don't know how to say it but it felt like a fuse just lit up in me and i was fucking studying hard. Turns out, that was my best performance ever. I had the best possible grade in all of my first year college exams studying by myself. Immediately, after that i got into a college for my second year with a full scholarship. But, i had lost my winning mentality and couldnt zone in on it. I had basically zoned out of it and possibly permanently. Got above average grades but i know that i performed no way near my first year.

It's easy to say you can't help it, or that you can't control it, but at the end of the day, you can. You just haven't been able to.  \n\n\nAlso, if you don't believe you can keep it consistent, then you won't be able to. Whatever you believe will be what ends up happening.  \n\n\nSo, the first thing you should do about this is to hold yourself accountable. It is your fault you can't stay consistent and you just need to do better in the future.  \n\n\nNow, after that, once you recognize you have full control over your own actions, then it's time to think WHY it is that you're feeling such a strong resistance. Is your life lacking balance? Are you having enough fun? Or are you just wearing yourself down?  \n\n\nCould this be a motivational thing? Maybe you're just not as intrinsically motivated to have the best performance possible academically. How much does that matter to you and why does it matter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving your WHY extremely clear will help you a lot.  \n\n\nAlso, you should try to analyze what were the factors that contributed to your epic performance in the past.

Many of my creative projects like programming, 3d modeling, game design, etc. I have a huge burst of motivation, energy, where I get a lot done in a short time frame, even being able to sit down and produce meaningful progress on many of them. Then follows maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe months of inactivity on them and I move onto another project, just eventually getting into that cycle all over again.\n\nI've tried to completely draw out my schedule, as in, what needs to get done, at what time, by what day, the description, all that. Yet I always fail to complete them (strangely enough though this doesn't really happen to me with writing). I feel like it's a mixture of burn out, frustration, and maybe incompetence? Once I hit a roadblock that I can't overcome after a decent amount of time, or having to learn a completely new library, plugin, leads to procrastination on my part. Of course, I do know that I am procrastinating during this, but anytime I try to force myself to sit down and think and get back into a similar state of mind when I was actually making progress, my mind starts to wander, and I eventually give up.\n\nIt also doesn't help that generally I'm much slower at making progress than I should. For example, it could take me 2 hours to finish a math homework that should only take 45 minutes or less, even if I completely understand the material and get the right answers. It's not like I CAN'T overcome the problem, it's just that I lose all motivation to even attempt the hours long debug or learning of something else after my initial burst. I've done this off-and-on for about since I was 13-14, so 2-3 years.

People who had loving, affirming, supportive caregivers usually don’t develop such a poor self image like you are describing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You may just have an unregulated nervous system and never properly learned how to ground yourself in your own body/experience. Maybe check out r/CPTSD?",
        "gpt_comment": "Dealing with self-loathing and severe self-criticism can be paralyzing. It's important to challenge these negative thoughts by focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, no matter how small. Therapy can be incredibly beneficial in addressing negative thought patterns and building self-esteem. Additionally, engaging in activities that make you feel competent and confident can help counteract feelings of inadequacy."

        "best_comment": "Firstly, I would start by saying, your first problem is thinking that you need motivation. Yeah, you heard me right. The greatest mirage society has ever created is that notion that “you need to feel motivated to be able to accomplish something”; this right here messed me up through out secondary school, I repeatedly kept failing classes all because I was too busy worrying that I couldn’t read unless I was motivated. Here’s where discipline comes in; doing it not because you FEEL like but because your growth as an individual DEPENDS on it ( this doesn’t apply only to academics).\n\n     I know all these might sound like a cliché but I’m honestly speaking from experience. I’m currently in my 1st year law major(18m) in my undergraduate University , 1st semester was hell on earth for me. However, what helped me was that I started looking into what my problems actually were, because after I read a book called “atomic habits”, it helped me understand myself better. One good point it made was this “our minds are pre-conditioned to avoid anything that stresses us”, and it deals with these through procrastination that usually comes out as lack of motivation. \n\nAfter identifying these problems, I  now had to ask myself “why does studying stress me out”? I did some research and it turned out that I had a terrible reading habit of regression and fixation; They are conscious acts of re-reading sentences and reading one word at a time, which impairs reading comprehension and efficiency. After this discovery, I worked hard to find a solution to them.  Over the months, I have consistently improved on them. Saying that by addressing these problems helped boost my academic performance would be an understatement in all honesty, because I went from procrastinating on a 12page weekly reading  to handling 70+ page weekly readings, and I ended up getting straight A’s in my previous semester, thanks to way I addressed these problems.\n\n \nLastly doing all these was extremely heart wrenching for me and incredibly frustrating as well. There were  many points in time where I wanted to give up, but I continued, not because I was motivated to but because I had to. \n\nP.S : Hope this helps, and good luck with your exams!",

        "gpt_comment": "Losing motivation to study can be tough, especially when facing significant exams. Try to recreate the environment or routines that helped you study effectively in the past. Breaking your study sessions into focused, short periods with clear goals can make the task seem less daunting. Also, consider studying with peers or joining study groups to enhance motivation through accountability."

      "body": "I am a 24 year old male who has aspirations of becoming a doctor. I once considered myself a hard worker and overall a good student (Found myself rarely procrastinating outside of a handful of situations). However, everything changed around the 5th and final year of my college degree when the pandemic hit. I found myself not caring for anything and having trouble getting the motivation to study as all the exams were open book and not really stimulating. I finally graduate from college and for the past year I have been preparing to take the mcat. However, for almost a year now I found myself not really studying or even putting in much effort in anything at all. I would study maybe 1-2 hours in the morning every day and get distracted/feel unmotivated (because of the difficulty) to continue until it's 1 pm and it's time to go to work. I took my MCAT back in September and got the results in October, and I bombed it pretty bad. I have no excuses as to why except that I was lazy and didn't give it a good effort. So I schedule my exam for January 27th of next year, made a schedule and commit and attempt to really put in effort. All of November was completely fine and my motivation was good, but I found myself slowly but surely getting less and less motivated and less and less disciplined. I am not afraid of failure, but I hate this feeling of failing myself and I am honestly so sick an tired of it. I planned on rescheduling my exam to march and honestly want change for the better. I want to go back to how I once was, but I need help and would appreciate any advice (don't sugar coat anything because I think I really need to hear it).",

        "best_comment": "No sugarcoating? Aight fam. \n\nBeing a doctor is way more stressful than sticking to a study routine for a couple months. Yeah, the pressure is unreal for the MCAT - but nothing compared to the pressure you may feel depending on what type of doctor you become, or the pressure to keep money coming into the hospital so they keep you, or the pressure to balance your insanely demanding career with the needs of your family. You need to develop an acquired taste for pressure, my dude, or you’re going to be miserable. \n\nYou slippin’ cause you’re at the homestretch and your mind has already considered it a given? Happens to the best of us. Few things are more powerful wake up calls than investing a shit ton of time/energy into something and it slipping away when it was almost within reach. You’re in the danger zone; **focus**. Senioritis is real, but you’re not at the end of anything dude, you’re barely at the beginning. Residency is going to *wear you out* for starters. \n\nOn the flip side, evaluate your well-being to make sure you’re firing on all cylinders - something may need addressing. Physically - get enough sleep, eat well and get your vitamins (why am I listing this out you’re a med student, you know the drill). Emotionally/mentally, are you running from something? Did the lockdowns shift your perspective? *what changed?* It may not simply come down to a lack of momentum that you’re having a hard time restarting - figure this part out. You’ll want it resolved before residency. \n\nThe path you’re going down requires more than people anticipate - all look at the benefits, glaze over the costs. Make sure you’re prepared to pay the cost, and if so, dig deep to reignite the drive (yeah, it’s gonna hurt and you’re gonna have to go out of your comfort zone so prepare for that). \n\nBest of luck.",

      "body": "I rarely use Reddit so not sure if this is the best place to share my ramblings but hopefully someone can offer some advice it would be much appreciated. This will probably be a long one.\n\nA year ago I was academically dismissed from college. I was in my 4th year and botched 2 semesters in a row. When COVID started everything went online and from that point I gradually started to lose all motivation to even touch my laptop. Got to a point where I just gave up on all of my classes and stopped doing anything for months. \n\nI just sat in my apartment and watched paint dry until the year was over, my lease was done and the letter came that said I was dismissed. I came back home to live at my Moms house and have been working my part time grocery store job that I’ve been at since high school. \n\nI’ve never been a great student but I wouldn’t say I was overall horrible either. I was always a B student but sometimes I could pull of an A if I really tried. When online school hit I quickly felt like I wasn’t capable of doing the work anymore. The college workload became annoying to me and I just got sick of doing the assignments. \n\nI don’t know how to convince myself the work isn’t stupid. It felt like most of the assignments I had to do were pointless, tedious busy work that didn’t really give me any skills or help improve anything for me to benefit. College felt more like it’s just pretentious professors that love hearing themselves talk more than anything else. I lost the will power to get things done even when annoyed by the college routine. So I failed. And the major of all things is media production. \n\nNot the most difficult thing you would think of. Which adds to the guilt and the feelings I have that make me think I’m a failure and that I’ve wasted a good opportunity. But I wasn’t really THAT interested in the major. It just seemed like the only one I could tolerate. \n\nI genuinely have no idea what I’m supposed to do with my life and I never have. I just chose media production because I thought, “video editing doesn’t sound too bad.” That’s all the thought that went into that decision. I’m not sure why some people believe that everyone has a passion buried inside of them but I have never been able to figure that out. I’m skating through life and literally feel worthless. \n\nI have no skills. I have nothing to show for myself. I somehow just lived for 22 years and now I have to figure out what to do with my life. Therapy isn’t bad, but I didn’t feel like it made any of this more clear. They just ask the same questions as everyone else. \n\n“What do you like to do?” \nIdk man that’s literally why I’m here I have no idea what I like to do I haven’t done shit my whole life. I’m currently miserable the only thing I like is not working all day like a rat. \n\nI don’t know if I’d even be able to go back to school or if I want to. I feel powerless because nothing entices me enough to bite the bullet and jump through hoops to accomplish something. I don’t know what I’m capable of. I envy people with a plan. I wish I had one. This whole year I’ve been trying to think of SOMETHING to do and I am no closer to figuring it out than I was a year ago. \n\nI know I sound like a bitter, irresponsible idiot, because I think I am one. I’m ashamed of wasting time doing absolutely nothing, but I’m not going to pick some random shit out of a hat on a whim because I will probably end up wasting even more time being miserable doing that.\n\n“Just try shit” doesn’t resonate with me. It’s such a vague thing to say. Try what? I’m not doing a trade wasting my life fixing furnaces in someone’s filthy ass basement for semi decent money. I have friends that do HVAC and I would rather jump into a volcano.\n\nI know how to use Adobe premier(but I’m in no way great at it) and probably wouldn’t hate video production as a career, I just hate school. The hoop jumping is what gets me. 99% of what I learned about editing came from YouTube. And at least half of the classes that cost thousands of dollars to take have nothing to do with shooting video or editing. This definitely factored into why I stopped trying in school. \n\nThere’s so much more I could say but Reddit mobile gets so laggy after the first few paragraphs so I’ll end it here. Thanks to anyone who took time out of their day to read this it feels good to write this out even though I’m clueless of what to do.\n\nEdit: Also I don’t want this to come off like a sob story or that I’m trying to make people feel bad for me or anything like that. I’m fully aware that I’m still blessed for having a mother who’s willing to put up with my dumbass living in her house while I have an existential crisis. I know there are so many people out there that have it so much worse than I do and that I eventually will straighten this shit out. I really appreciate everyone’s comments it means the world to me.",

It’s just that your aimlessness sounds a lot like executive dysfunction. \n\nADHD brains don’t make dopamine the way typical brains do.

So it’s extremely hard for some people to do.. anything. Because there is literally no Feel Good Reward after they do it. So sometimes it’s hard to find anything to be interested in at all. \n\nAnyway. Just a thought. Might help to rule it out if you haven’t already.",
