    "post_body":"I really feel like a complete failure. I Can\u2019t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I\u2019m not as productive as I\u2019d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I\u2019m just so disappointed in my self. It\u2019s hard to drink water. I\u2019m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I\u2019m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I\u2019m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I\u2019m just mad at life. I\u2019m not depressed I\u2019m just disappointed. \n\nI\u2019m a ball full of energy. I\u2019m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I\u2019m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I\u2019m a caffeine addict. I don\u2019t know how I will function without my meds when I\u2019m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven\u2019t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don\u2019t wanna do. I\u2019m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don\u2019t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can\u2019t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I\u2019m\nTired of going in circles :\/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",
    "comment_best_human":"Re: the meds part, why?  Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what's wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\n\nThat's how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol",
    "comment_10th_human":"Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That\u2019s why you feel like you have no energy.  It\u2019s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it\u2019s worth it.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\n\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\n\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not a failure. You have a job, you're in school, you take care of your appearance, and most importantly - you WANT to improve. That's a solid foundation to build from.\n\nLet's tackle this step by step. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE small habit to master first. Since you mentioned feeling physically bad, let's start with water intake. Get a large water bottle and keep it with you always. Set specific times to drink - when you wake up, with meals, etc. Make it dead simple.\n\nFor the binge eating, especially on non-medication days, try planning your meals in advance. Prep healthy snacks and meals when you're on Vyvanse and feeling motivated. That way, when the harder days come, you just need to heat up what's already made. The goal isn't perfection - it's making the healthy choice slightly easier than the unhealthy one.\n\nFor productivity and focus, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day. Your brain is like a muscle - you need to gradually build up its capacity for sustained focus. Don't expect to maintain the same productivity level off-medication as on it. Instead, adjust your expectations and create different routines for different days.\n\nWhen you slip up (which everyone does), don't view it as starting over. Think of it like GPS recalculating - you're just finding a new route to the same destination. Keep a simple journal noting what triggers your binges or productivity dips. This info will help you adjust your strategy over time.\n\nRemember: discipline isn't about being perfect every day. It's about showing up consistently and making slightly better choices over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're really struggling with developing discipline and breaking free from some tough habits, especially when it comes to food and motivation. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing these patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. \n\nGiven your ADHD diagnosis and medication schedule, it might be helpful to focus on building small, manageable habits on your non-medication days. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start with tiny goals like drinking one extra glass of water or taking a short 10-minute walk. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum.\n\nIt's also important to address the binge eating and emotional relationship with food. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders - they can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues. \n\nIn terms of rewiring your brain for discipline, it's not about being perfect, but about making progress. You might find it helpful to set clear, achievable goals for yourself, break them down into smaller tasks, and create an environment that supports those goals (e.g., removing tempting foods from your home, finding a workout buddy, etc.). \n\nRemember, discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it's okay if you don't see immediate results. It's about showing up every day, making small efforts, and being kind to yourself when you slip up. You're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you develop the habits and discipline you're looking for. Keep in mind that it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, but also that you're really motivated to make some changes, which is awesome. It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're juggling ADHD, binge eating, and everything else life throws at you.\n\nFirst, be kind to yourself. You're already doing a lot \u2013 college, a job, taking care of yourself. That's not nothing! It's easy to get caught up in what you *aren't* doing, but try to acknowledge what you *are* accomplishing.\n\nRegarding discipline, it's not about a complete brain reset. It's more like training a muscle. Start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's drinking more water. Set a realistic goal \u2013 like one extra glass a day \u2013 and build from there. When you've nailed that, add another small change.\n\nFor the food and phone cravings, try to identify your triggers. When do you usually reach for those things? Can you replace them with something else? Maybe a walk, a quick meditation, or even just a different app on your phone. There are apps that can help you limit your time on social media, which might be useful.\n\nAbout your meds, have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling on and off them? Maybe there's a tweak that could help with the binge eating on your off days. It's also worth exploring therapy, especially for the binge eating disorder. A therapist can give you tools to manage those urges and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nAs for staying focused, the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks) can be really helpful for ADHD. It breaks down tasks into manageable chunks and gives you built-in rewards.\n\nFinally, remember that setbacks are normal. Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You've got this! Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n",
    "comment_o1":"Sometimes it helps to simplify and tackle one thing at a time, so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. Try making your routine super basic but consistent: schedule a set bedtime and wake-up time, plan small, reasonable meals or snack times, and keep water close by so you actually remember to drink it. On your non-med days, aim for a short, low-pressure workout\u2014like a 10-minute walk or yoga session\u2014just to keep the momentum. With binge eating, don\u2019t label yourself as \u201cfailing\u201d if you slip up; practice resetting right after rather than waiting until the next day. Even a simple shift like putting your phone in another room while you study or work can help you stay focused. Let yourself build discipline gradually by proving you can stick to tiny, not-too-hard promises each day. Whenever you start feeling discouraged, remind yourself why you\u2019re doing it\u2014your future family, your goals, and your own well-being\u2014and keep stepping forward, even if it\u2019s just an inch at a time.",

    "comment_best_human":"I am right there with you fighting the same battle. The only things helping me move forward (slowly) are these 3 things:\n1. I deleted all social media beside Reddit. No Tik Tok, no Instagram, no Facebook- nothing that will allow me to mindlessly scroll. It has actually caused me to pick up a book and read. \n2. When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself \u201cWhat is something small I can do right now?\u201d. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I\u2019m not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in 1 go, but I have at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something. \n3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud \u201cDon\u2019t put it down- put it away.\u201d This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. \n\nMaybe these will help you move forward. It\u2019s a small start.\n\nAlso, the book Atomic Habits is slowly but surely changing my life and making even these tiny gains happen. I recommend running to get it. Before I started to read it, I wondered if maybe I was depressed. And truthfully, maybe I still am. But this book is helping me realize that it is not a lack of goals or motivation that is my problem, it is a lack of good systems in my life. Maybe the book and those 3 starters can help you begin building up your systems too. Sending good thoughts your way!",
    "comment_10th_human":"I'm about to do the reverse, reddit got to go it's mindless scrolling for me, even the \"news\" is filled with mindless drama and banter. Pages and pages of tits and ass I'll don't know and will never know. Outlandish rage inducing video that suck you in to scroll hours of dumb comments. At least with facebook it's real friends and Instagram it's my buddy's posting things about there life I can relate too.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but the good news is that you're already taking the first step by reaching out for advice. Here's a simple approach to get started: \n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task that you can complete today. It could be as simple as making your bed or organizing your desk. The key is to build momentum with small wins.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time. Use a planner or an app to keep track of your tasks and prioritize them.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and leisure. Consistency is crucial in building discipline.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process.\n\nThis subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes. Keep pushing forward, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there - this is definitely the right subreddit, and what you're describing is super common. The key is to start really small instead of trying to tackle everything at once.\n\nPick ONE tiny task that takes 5 minutes or less. It could be making your bed, doing 5 pushups, or reading one page of a book. Do just that one thing consistently for a week. Don't worry about anything else on your to-do list right now.\n\nThe goal isn't the task itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on a commitment. Once that small habit feels automatic (usually takes 1-2 weeks), add another tiny task. \n\nThis approach works because it:\n1) Prevents the overwhelm that's currently paralyzing you\n2) Builds momentum through small wins\n3) Rewires your brain to associate action with positive feelings\n\nRemember: You don't need motivation to act. Action creates motivation. Start ridiculously small, be consistent, and let the momentum build naturally.\n\nWhat's one tiny task you could commit to doing tomorrow?",
    "comment_llama":"You're definitely in the right place here on r\/getdisciplined. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge where you're at and want to make a change, so kudos to you for that first step. To start building a different mindset, I'd recommend beginning with small, manageable tasks that you can accomplish daily. This will help you build momentum and confidence. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your goals into tiny, bite-sized chunks. For example, if you want to start exercising, commit to doing just 5-10 minutes of stretching or a short walk each day. As you consistently complete these small tasks, you'll start to develop a sense of discipline and productivity that can then be applied to larger goals. It's also important to set clear priorities and focus on one task at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by your entire to-do list. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You got this, and we're all here to support you.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that feeling of being stuck. It's super common! The \"overwhelmed and do none of them\" part is key. You're trying to tackle too much at once.\n\nHere's my advice: start ridiculously small. Seriously. Pick ONE thing you want to do, and make the goal laughably easy. Like, if you want to read more, aim for reading just one page a day. If you want to exercise, do 5 minutes of stretching. The point isn't the accomplishment itself, it's building the habit of *starting*.\n\nOnce you've consistently done that tiny thing for a week or two, *then* you can gradually increase it. The momentum will surprise you.\n\nAs for mindset, it's less about a sudden shift and more about consistent action. Each small win builds confidence and makes the next step easier. And yes, this is definitely the right subreddit for this! Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve found that it really helps to start with just one small, clear task and commit to finishing it no matter how trivial it seems. Trying to do everything at once can freeze you in place, so scale down your plan until you feel you can handle it today. When you consistently knock out little tasks, you build a quiet confidence and momentum that makes the bigger stuff less intimidating. It\u2019s not about a personality overhaul overnight, but rather about showing up for yourself each day, even in a small way. And yes, this is definitely the right place to post\u2014people here get the struggle and have lots of good tips and support to share.

My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost.

A 10 or 100 small steps in the right direction  will still be 10 or 100 steps better then where you were before.\n\nHaving said that, make a list of things or goals in major areas of your life physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.\n\n3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\n\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to make changes and improve your life. You're not alone in feeling lost, and taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Keep pushing forward!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there. First off, 31 is still young - you've got plenty of time to build the life you want. It's good that you already have fitness as a cornerstone habit and some savings to work with. Let's build on that foundation.\n\nStart by creating a simple daily routine. Since you're already into fitness, use that as your anchor. Add one small habit at a time - maybe reading for 15 minutes after your workout, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill online. The key is consistency over intensity.\n\nFor the career front, consider what interests naturally align with your fitness background. Personal training, health coaching, or even fitness-related content creation could be worth exploring. Or you might want to go in a completely different direction - that's fine too. Pick one direction and take small steps: update your resume, apply to one job daily, or take an online course in your chosen field.\n\nFor building relationships, look for local fitness groups or sports leagues. These give you a natural way to meet people while doing something you're already comfortable with. Meetup.com can be good for finding groups aligned with whatever interests you develop as you explore new activities.\n\nRemember that everyone you meet who seems to \"have it together\" went through their own period of feeling lost. The difference is they kept moving forward, even if they weren't sure of the destination. Focus on taking one small action each day that moves you toward a better life, whether that's applying for a job, learning something new, or meeting new people. Progress compounds over time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, which is totally understandable given everything you've been through. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you have some savings to fall back on and that you're taking care of your physical health through fitness - those are definitely positives to build on. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small and focus on building one or two new habits or routines outside of fitness. This could be something as simple as reading for 30 minutes each day, learning a new skill or hobby, or volunteering in your community. Sometimes, having a sense of purpose or feeling like we're making progress in one area can help spill over into other areas of our lives.\n\nIt's also worth considering seeking out some professional help, whether that's a therapist or counselor, to work through some of the underlying issues that might be contributing to your feelings of depression and isolation. They can help you develop strategies for managing your emotions and improving your relationships with others.\n\nAs for feeling like you're making a difference in people's lives, that's a really admirable goal. You might consider looking into local volunteer opportunities or joining a community group that aligns with your interests. This could be a great way to meet new people and start building a support system, while also feeling like you're contributing to something bigger than yourself.\n\nLastly, try not to be too hard on yourself about your past relationships or the fact that you don't have everything figured out at 31. Lots of people are still finding their way at this age, and it's never too late to make positive changes in your life. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging where you're at and wanting to make a change - now it's just about taking things one step at a time and being patient with yourself as you work towards building a more fulfilling life.",

Think about what aspects of fitness you enjoy \u2013 is it the structure, the physical challenge, the feeling of accomplishment? Try to apply those elements to other areas.\n\nJob-wise, even small steps can make a difference. Could you dedicate just 30 minutes a day to job searching or skill-building? Maybe take an online course related to something you're even remotely interested in. The key is consistency, even if it's just a little bit each day.\n\nRegarding relationships, it's understandable that you're feeling isolated. Instead of focusing on finding a romantic partner right now, maybe try joining a group related to your fitness interests or a hobby you'd like to explore. It's a low-pressure way to meet people with shared interests. Even volunteering could help you feel like you're making a difference and connect with others.\n\nAs for feeling \"crazy,\" it's normal to have ups and downs. Maybe consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and help you develop coping mechanisms.

    "comment_o1":"It\u2019s never too late to start making changes.

For the 5am workout habit, since you're already up at that time, maybe try setting up your workout gear the night before so it's the first thing you see in the morning. You could also schedule your workout like an important meeting, blocking that time off just for exercise. If you find yourself gravitating towards work, maybe set a rule that you can't start work until after your workout. Lastly, consider finding a workout buddy or joining a class to add some accountability. Keep at it, and soon it'll be as automatic as your other habits!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, congrats on successfully building those two solid habits - flossing and cold showers are no small feat! The fact that you've already experienced the benefits of 5am workouts (more energy, better food choices) is actually a huge advantage. You know the \"why\" behind wanting to make this stick.\n\nSince you're naturally gravitating toward work in the morning, try creating a physical barrier between you and your work setup. Put your workout clothes right next to your bed the night before, and maybe even sleep in your workout shorts. Make getting to work slightly more difficult than getting to your workout gear.\n\nOne effective approach is to start ridiculously small - commit to just 5 minutes of exercise when you first wake up. Often the hardest part is just starting, but once you're moving, you'll likely want to continue. After a week of consistent 5-minute sessions, gradually increase the duration.\n\nYou might also try \"habit stacking\" - link your workout to your existing morning routine. Right after your cold shower could be your trigger to exercise. The key is making the workout the path of least resistance in your morning.\n\nRemember that missing one day isn't failure - it's just a data point. What made you choose work instead? Use that insight to adjust your strategy. The goal is progress, not perfection.",
    "comment_llama":"It's great that you've already established some solid habits like flossing and cold showers, and now you're looking to add another one. Given that you're a morning person and can wake up at 5am without issue, it sounds like the challenge is more about prioritizing your workout over work. One strategy you could try is to set a clear goal for what you want to achieve with your 5am workouts, and then schedule them in your calendar as non-negotiable appointments. This might help you mentally prepare to put your workout first, before diving into work. Additionally, you could try to make your workout routine more enjoyable, whether that's finding a workout buddy, listening to music or podcasts, or trying out a new type of exercise. This might help shift your motivation and make it feel less like a chore. Lastly, consider starting small - instead of aiming for a full hour-long workout, start with 20-30 minutes and gradually increase the duration as the habit becomes more established. Good luck!",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, congrats on the flossing and cold showers, that's awesome! It sounds like you're already building good momentum.\n\nSince you're a morning person and the waking up isn't the issue, it seems like the pull of work is the biggest hurdle. Maybe try these:\n\n1. **Prep the night before:** Lay out your workout clothes, have your water bottle ready, and maybe even pre-select your workout. Reduce any friction that might make you choose work.\n\n2. **Start ridiculously small:** Don't aim for a full hour workout right away. Commit to just 15 minutes. Tell yourself you can stop after 15, but often you'll keep going. It's about building the habit, not crushing a workout every day.\n\n3. **Reward yourself (appropriately):** After your workout, have something you enjoy (that isn't work!). Maybe a specific coffee or a few minutes of reading. Positive reinforcement can work wonders.\n\n4. **Accountability:** Tell someone you're doing this, or find a workout buddy. Knowing someone else is expecting you can be a powerful motivator.\n\n5. **Reframe \"work\":** Is it possible you're using work as a form of avoidance? Maybe there's something about the workout you're not enjoying. Experiment with different types of exercise until you find something you genuinely like.\n\nGood luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"One trick is to pre-commit the night before by laying out your workout clothes and planning exactly what you\u2019ll do in the gym.

Also, try establishing a rule for yourself that work can\u2019t start until you\u2019ve done at least a brief workout, even if it\u2019s just 15 minutes at first. This helps tell your brain, \u201cWe do this before anything else.\u201d Once you\u2019ve built that initial consistency, you can gradually push yourself to longer or tougher sessions, and you\u2019ll likely find it easier to stick to once your routine is locked in.",

    "post_body":"\nI am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it\u2019s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it\u2019s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don\u2019t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it\u2019s cheap in India) but I don\u2019t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it\u2019s another hassle to manage. \nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\nIs it too much to ask ? Please help.\nAlso, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.",
    "comment_best_human":"Cook in Batches like for 2\/3 days. It saves a good chunck of time and you can use it for purposes. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.",
    "comment_10th_human":"Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it",
    "comment_gpt4":"Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\n\nSince you\u2019re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about finding a balance that works for you. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there! Your situation is totally manageable - lots of working professionals face similar challenges with balancing work, cooking, and self-care. Here's what's worked well for others:\n\nMeal prep is going to be your best friend. Pick one day (maybe Sunday) to do most of your cooking for the week. Make larger batches of curry, dal, or whatever you enjoy, and portion them out. You can freeze some portions for later in the week. This front-loads the time investment so you're not cooking daily.\n\nFor weekday cooking, start with a \"capsule kitchen\" approach. Keep a limited but versatile set of ingredients that can make multiple dishes. Rice, lentils, common vegetables, and basic spices. This reduces both shopping time and decision fatigue.\n\nSince you're not keen on hiring help (which is completely understandable), try breaking housework into small daily tasks rather than letting it pile up. Maybe 15 minutes of cleaning in the morning and washing dishes right after eating. Put on some music or a podcast - it makes chores more enjoyable.\n\nFor morning routine, instead of forcing yourself to wake up super early, focus first on consistency. 8am is fine! Build a reliable routine at that time before trying to shift earlier. A consistent wake time will actually help you feel more energized than constantly fighting to wake up earlier.\n\nConsider doing quick workouts at home to save commute time to a gym. Even 20 minutes of yoga or bodyweight exercises can make a big difference. You could do this while your breakfast is cooking.\n\nRemember - you don't have to perfect everything at once. Start with one area (like meal prep) and once that becomes routine, add another habit. Small, sustainable changes add up to big improvements over time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're taking on a lot of new responsibilities and wanting to prioritize your work, health, and personal time. First, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of cooking for yourself and wanting to manage your household independently. To save time physically and mentally, consider implementing a few strategies: meal prep on weekends or one day a week, plan your meals for the next few days, and make a grocery list to avoid last-minute shopping trips. You can also look into simple, one-pot recipes that don't require a lot of cleanup. \n\nFor managing your household chores, try breaking them down into smaller tasks that you can fit into your daily routine, like washing dishes immediately after dinner or dedicating 10-15 minutes to tidying up each day. As for waking up earlier, it's great that you're trying to adjust your schedule - start by setting small, achievable goals, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and use that time for a short workout or some stretching.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect; it's about finding a balance that works for you. You might need to experiment with different routines and schedules before finding what suits you best. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything right away - focus on making progress, and celebrate your small wins along the way.

It's great that you're trying to build healthier habits and manage your own space.\n\nFirst, about the food situation: meal prepping is your friend. Since you're already thinking about chopping veggies in advance, dedicate a couple of hours on the weekend to prepping all your ingredients for the week. Think about batch cooking too \u2013 make a big pot of something on Sunday that you can eat for lunches or dinners for a few days. There are tons of simple recipes online that require minimal effort. Also, don't feel like every meal has to be a gourmet experience. Sometimes a simple salad or a quick stir-fry is perfectly fine.\n\nRegarding housework, maybe try setting a timer for 15-20 minutes each day to tackle one specific task, like dishes or wiping down surfaces. Small bursts of focused effort can make a big difference. You could also break down cleaning into smaller, more manageable chunks throughout the week.\n\nAs for the maid situation, I get your hesitation. Maybe you could try finding someone through a trusted referral or a reputable agency that does background checks. Even having someone come in once a week for a few hours could free up a lot of your time and mental energy.\n\nFor workouts, don't feel pressured to wake up super early right away. Start small. Maybe try a 10-minute stretching routine or a quick walk before work. Gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get more comfortable.\n\nFinally, remember to be kind to yourself.

    "comment_o1":"Meal-prepping on the weekend can be a huge timesaver. If you can spend a couple of hours chopping veggies, mixing basic sauces, and maybe marinating proteins, you\u2019ll be able to throw meals together more quickly on weekdays. Cooking in batches (like making a big pot of dal or curry and freezing half) also helps so you\u2019re not starting from scratch each evening. It might help to set a fixed weekly grocery shopping time and keep a running list so you\u2019re not constantly worrying about what to buy. As for cleaning, try a quick 10-minute tidy routine each day so it doesn\u2019t build up. You could also consider having a maid come in just once a week for a deeper clean, so the day-to-day upkeep is lighter. For squeezing in workouts, keep it manageable: even a 15-minute routine in the morning or evening can make a difference. Over time, you\u2019ll get into a flow and feel less stressed juggling it all.",

    "comment_claude":"Here's what helped me break the endless scrolling cycle: start by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete social media apps and only access them through your browser. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less appealing.\n\nNext, create \"speed bumps\" that make you pause before mindlessly grabbing your phone. Move social media apps into a folder on your second or third home screen. Set up app timers (both iPhone and Android have these built in). Put a rubber band or sticky note on your phone as a physical reminder to ask \"do I really need to check this right now?\"\n\nThe key is replacing the habit with something else when you need breaks. Keep a book nearby, do some quick stretches, or even just close your eyes for 2 minutes. These alternatives can still give you that mental breather without sucking you into the scroll vortex.\n\nStart small - try setting a 15-minute daily limit on your most-used social media app. Once that feels manageable, gradually reduce limits on other apps. You'll likely slip up sometimes, but that's normal. Just reset and try again the next day.\n\nRemember: your phone should be a tool that serves you, not the other way around. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the issue. Now it's just about making small changes that add up over time.",
    "comment_llama":"One strategy that might help is setting specific times when you allow yourself to check social media, and sticking to those times.

You could also try removing social media apps from your phone's home screen or using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl to limit your access to certain sites during certain hours of the day. Another approach is to replace social media with a different habit when you feel tired or need a break, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises.

Delete the apps from your phone and only access them on your computer (which is less convenient). Or, use app blockers to limit your time on specific apps.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself.

For example, if you need to write a report, set a goal to write just one paragraph today. This makes it less daunting and easier to start.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your tasks at the same time each day. This helps build a habit and reduces the mental energy needed to decide when to start.\n\n3. **Use a Timer**: The Pomodoro Technique can be really effective. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and prevent burnout.\n\n4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for completing even the smallest tasks. This can help reinforce positive behavior and keep you motivated.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of the day, take a moment to reflect on what worked and what didn\u2019t. Adjust your approach as needed.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",

And each time you break that promise to yourself, you're weakening your self-trust. \n\nTry this approach instead: When you start a task and feel that initial boost of accomplishment, immediately set a tiny next step. Not \"I'll finish this later\" but \"I'll do exactly X more minutes\/pages\/steps right now.\" Make it small enough that it feels almost ridiculous to quit. This builds momentum through small wins rather than relying on sustained motivation.\n\nFor breaking the procrastination loop, use the 5-minute rule. When you catch yourself thinking about doing something \"later,\" either start it for just 5 minutes right now, or explicitly schedule it (with a specific time) in your calendar. No vague \"tomorrows.\" This forces you to either commit or honestly acknowledge you're choosing not to do it.\n\nRemember: Future You will have the exact same struggles as Present You.

Make sure these chunks are so small that you can't say no to them - like 10-15 minutes of work. This way, you're not relying on feeling motivated or confident, but rather on a clear plan of action. Additionally, try to acknowledge and accept your past procrastination patterns, rather than beating yourself up over them. It's okay to have struggled in the past, and it doesn't define your ability to succeed in the present.

Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus.\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify your biggest distractions and find ways to minimize them. This might mean setting specific times for social media or using apps that block distracting sites while you study.\n\n4. **Visualize Success**: Spend a few minutes each day visualizing yourself succeeding in the exam. This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can be a great stress reliever. Even a short walk or some stretching can clear your mind and improve focus.\n\n6. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to someone who has been through this process or a mentor who can offer guidance and support.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got a month to go, and that's plenty of time to make a difference. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"The pressure you're feeling is completely normal given what's at stake. But here's the thing - you're sabotaging yourself because you're afraid of giving it your all and still failing. It's easier to say \"I didn't really try\" than \"I tried my absolute hardest and it wasn't enough.\"\n\nFirst, you need to accept that failure is possible even with your best effort. That's scary, but it's also liberating. When you truly accept this, you can stop avoiding the work and start focusing on what's in your control - your daily actions.\n\nFor the next month, create a strict daily schedule. Break your study sessions into 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro technique). Start with just 4 chunks per day and gradually increase. During study time, put your phone in another room and use website blockers for distracting sites.\n\nEach evening, write down your specific study goals for the next day. Make them concrete and achievable - like \"Complete practice problems 1-20\" rather than just \"study hard.\"\n\nRemember, MIT isn't a dream - it's a goal that requires consistent action. Whether you succeed or fail won't be determined by fate or luck, but by what you do in these next 30 days. Every time you feel the urge to procrastinate, ask yourself: \"What would my future self want me to do right now?\"\n\nYou've already put in a year of preparation. Don't let fear waste that investment. Start small, but start now. The next 30 days can change everything, but only if you're willing to be uncomfortable and face the pressure head-on.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of fear of failure and procrastination, which is totally understandable given the high stakes of this exam. One thing that might help is to break down your studying into smaller, manageable chunks, so it doesn't feel as overwhelming. Instead of thinking \"I need to study for hours every day,\" try telling yourself \"I'll study for 25 minutes without any breaks, and then I can take a 5-minute break.\" This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n\nIt's also important to address the underlying fear that's holding you back. You mentioned that you're afraid of failure, but it sounds like you're also afraid of not living up to your own potential. Try to reframe your thinking around this exam - instead of \"I need to pass this exam or my life will be ruined,\" tell yourself \"I'm going to do my best to prepare for this exam, and whatever happens, I'll learn from the experience and move forward.\" Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you can always try again.\n\nAs for the distractions, it might be helpful to remove or limit your access to them while you're studying. Try turning off your phone or putting it in a different room, or using a website blocker to prevent yourself from getting sidetracked by social media or other online temptations.\n\nLastly, remind yourself why this goal is important to you - getting into MIT is a huge opportunity, and it's worth putting in the hard work to achieve it. You've already come so far and prepared for an entire year, don't give up now. You got this!",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's awesome that you're reaching out and recognizing the issue. Procrastination and avoidance are super common when the stakes feel high.\n\nFirst, cut yourself some slack. You've been working hard for a year, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. But you're right, you need to shift gears.\n\nInstead of thinking about the whole exam and MIT, break things down. What's one small, specific thing you can study for 30 minutes *right now*? Seriously, close Reddit and do that one thing. Then take a *real* break \u2013 get up, walk around, grab a healthy snack.\n\nThe key is to build momentum. Small wins lead to bigger wins. Try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused study, 5-minute break. Repeat. It helps manage the urge to get distracted.\n\nAlso, be honest with yourself about the distractions. Block those dating sites and maybe use a website blocker for porn. It's temporary, just for this month.\n\nRegarding the \"what ifs,\" try writing them down. Get them out of your head. Then, write down counter-arguments. Challenge those negative thoughts.\n\nFinally, remember why you started. Visualize yourself at MIT. Feel that accomplishment. Use that as fuel. You've got this. One month is plenty of time to make a difference. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It sounds like fear of failure is paralyzing you more than the exam itself. One way to push through is to focus on consistent, structured study times and accept that some days won\u2019t be perfect. Instead of letting the pressure build until you collapse, set a realistic schedule in smaller chunks: commit to studying for a set time, then allow yourself a short break to decompress, and repeat. It helps to physically remove distractions\u2014close tabs, turn off your phone, or move to a different room\u2014so you don\u2019t rely purely on willpower. If you find yourself drifting off or fantasizing, notice it without beating yourself up, then bring your attention back to the material. Each session completed is a small win that builds momentum, and the more you repeat this pattern, the more you\u2019ll see you can handle the pressure. Feeling anxious about a huge goal is normal, but you can chip away at that anxiety by doing something productive right now, even if it\u2019s just 20 minutes of focused study. Over time, those 20-minute blocks add up and help you realize that failure isn\u2019t the story here\u2014taking action is.",

    "post_body":"Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4\/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \"I didn't have much more to say\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical \/ affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3\/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\n\n**Two minors issues**\n\n* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4\/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \n \n\n**My two biggest issues**\n\n* **Dealing with porn \/ masturbation \/ NoFap** \\--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3\/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn \/ masturbation in my life?\" and the thought really really scares me.  \n \n* **Dating** \\--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \n \n\n**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",

If you\u2019re dissatisfied now that means you need to take whatever small things you can start TODAY and go from there. It takes such a long time to make active changes in your life no matter how small or low you aim you need to start today.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, kudos for reaching out and being open about what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Let's break this down a bit.\n\nFor your body image and gym routine, it's great that you're already making strides. The key to maintaining it is to find a routine that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing long-term. Maybe mix it up with activities you like, whether it's a sport, hiking, or even dancing. Consistency is more sustainable when it's fun.\n\nCutting down on alcohol is a solid move, especially since you've noticed it affects your decisions. Try setting clear boundaries for yourself, like limiting drinks to certain occasions or opting for non-alcoholic alternatives when socializing. It\u2019s all about finding a balance that works for you.\n\nRegarding NoFap, remember that it's okay to take small steps. Instead of thinking about never doing it again, focus on reducing the frequency gradually. Celebrate small victories, like going a few days without it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. It's a journey, not a sprint.\n\nAs for dating, it's perfectly okay to take a break and focus on yourself, especially with all the changes coming up. Building a strong relationship with yourself can make future relationships more fulfilling. If you're worried about loneliness, try deepening connections with friends or exploring new hobbies that bring you joy and community.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right path by identifying what you want to change. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Thanks for sharing your story - it takes courage to open up about these challenges. Let me address your main concerns:\n\nFor the porn\/masturbation issue, rather than thinking of it as a permanent life change that you have to commit to forever (which can feel overwhelming), try taking it one day at a time. Each day is a fresh start. When urges come up, have a plan ready - go for a walk, do some pushups, call a friend, or work on a hobby. The key is replacing the habit with healthier coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety.\n\nRegarding dating, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. There's nothing wrong with taking a few months to focus on personal growth, especially given your upcoming moves. Use this time to build habits that make you feel good about yourself - the gym routine you've started is perfect. When you do date again, try to approach it with less emphasis on impressing others and more on genuine connection.\n\nFor maintaining habits long-term (like the gym), the key is starting small and being consistent rather than perfect. Instead of working out daily, maybe commit to 3 times a week so it's more sustainable when school starts. Same goes for alcohol - rather than trying to quit completely, set clear boundaries like \"only on weekends\" or \"max 2 drinks.\"\n\nRemember that building discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small, consistent improvements and getting back on track when you slip up. Focus on one change at a time rather than trying to transform everything at once. You've already taken positive steps by going to the gym and reducing drinking - that shows you're capable of making meaningful changes.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles and vulnerabilities with others, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of emotional, physical, and habitual challenges, but the fact that you're acknowledging them and seeking help is a huge step forward.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was your tendency to self-sabotage or fall back into old habits when things get tough. This is really common, especially when it comes to things like exercise, drinking, or porn use. One strategy that might help is to focus on building self-compassion and understanding why you're turning to these coping mechanisms in the first place. Instead of beating yourself up over setbacks, try to approach them with kindness and curiosity. Ask yourself what triggered the behavior, and what you can do differently next time.\n\nRegarding your concerns about dating and relationships, it might be helpful to take a step back and focus on building a stronger sense of self before diving into new relationships. This doesn't mean you have to give up on love or connection entirely, but rather that you prioritize getting to know yourself, your values, and what you want out of life. This can help you develop a sense of stability and confidence that will serve you well in any future relationships.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the NoFap journey. It's tough, and it's okay to slip up sometimes. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to quit cold turkey forever, try focusing on progress, not perfection. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be afraid to seek out support or resources when you need them.\n\nRemember, personal growth is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own needs and well-being above all else. You got this, and you're not alone.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now, but it's awesome that you're actively trying to improve things. It takes courage to face these issues head-on.\n\nRegarding the gym, instead of aiming for perfection right away, maybe focus on consistency. Even if it's just 2-3 times a week when school gets busy, that's way better than stopping completely. Think maintenance, not just transformation. Find something you enjoy doing at the gym too, that'll make it easier to stick with.\n\nCutting back on alcohol is a great goal. Maybe try finding some non-alcoholic drinks you enjoy so you have options when you're in social situations. It's okay to take it slow and celebrate small wins.\n\nThe porn\/masturbation issue is tough, and it's super common. Don't beat yourself up about relapsing. Five days is a good start! Instead of thinking \"never again,\" maybe focus on smaller, achievable goals, like \"I'll go one day without it.\" Find other things to do when you feel the urge \u2013 go for a walk, read a book, call a friend. The fear of a \"life-changing decision\" is real, so break it down into smaller, manageable steps. There are some great resources in the r\/NoFap community too.\n\nAs for dating, it's totally valid to feel exhausted by it. Maybe take a break and focus on building your own stability and happiness. You don't *need* a relationship to be happy. Use this time to explore your hobbies, connect with your friends, and just enjoy being you. When you feel more grounded, you can revisit dating if you want. It's okay to prioritize yourself right now, especially with the upcoming moves. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find \"the one,\" and that can make dating feel like a chore.\n\nJust remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs. Be kind to yourself, celebrate your wins, and learn from your setbacks. You've got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to remember that sustainable change usually comes from steady, realistic habits rather than big all-or-nothing decisions. For the fitness goal, aim for a routine you can keep up even on busy days, like shorter gym sessions or quick workouts at home\u2014something that fits your lifestyle instead of taking it over. That way, once you reach your goal, you won\u2019t be tempted to give it up completely. The same goes for cutting back on alcohol: moderation can be a good step if quitting outright feels too big right now. Little by little, you build momentum.\n\nFor the porn issue, consider focusing on one day at a time rather than worrying about never doing it again. It can feel overwhelming to think in absolutes. You might try filling the times you\u2019d normally slip up with small alternatives, like a quick walk or journaling. Distraction and mindful awareness of triggers go a long way. If you find yourself relapsing, try not to beat yourself up\u2014just reset and keep going.\n\nYour questions about dating sound totally normal, especially when life is in flux. If you\u2019re feeling burnt out by the whole process, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a break and putting that energy toward yourself. Sometimes stepping away to invest in your goals, self-confidence, and well-being makes future connections healthier and less stressful. You\u2019re not missing out if you\u2019re using that time to grow. The key is prioritizing your own stability and happiness first, so when you do date, you\u2019re doing it from a place of strength and clarity. Good luck\u2014take it one day at a time.",

    "post_body":"For the past two years, I have been sleeping, dreaming about me being a sissy and pleasuring different people I have met and am friends with. I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\n\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don\u2019t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked.

    "comment_claude":"Hey there - this is clearly having a significant impact on your life, and it's good that you're reaching out for help. Porn addiction is a real issue that can affect many aspects of life, including sleep, focus, and self-image. \n\nThe first step is to recognize that this has become a compulsive behavior that's interfering with your studies and mental wellbeing. You'll want to break this cycle through a combination of practical changes and support.\n\nStart by installing solid website blockers on all your devices - I recommend Cold Turkey or Freedom. Block access to all porn sites and related content. Delete saved links and clear your browsing history to remove easy access points.\n\nFor the sleep issues, you'll need to establish a new bedtime routine. Put your phone in another room. Try meditation apps, reading, or listening to sleep stories instead. It may be tough at first, but your brain needs to relearn how to sleep without the current associations.\n\nFor your studies, set up your workspace in public areas like the library where you can't access inappropriate content. Use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minute breaks. This helps rebuild concentration gradually.\n\nMost importantly, you don't have to tackle this alone. Consider joining r\/pornfree for community support. There are also counselors who specialize in porn addiction and can help you work through the underlying issues. Many universities offer free counseling services - take advantage of that.\n\nRemember that your worth isn't defined by this struggle.

First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share something like this, so kudos to you for being honest about what you're going through.\n\nTo start addressing this, I'd recommend taking a two-pronged approach: tackling the sleep issue and working on building your confidence and motivation. For sleep, you might want to try establishing a consistent bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn or erotic thoughts. This could be as simple as reading a book, meditating, or doing some light exercise before bed.\n\nRegarding the porn addiction, it might be helpful to identify triggers that lead you to watch sissy porn and find alternative ways to cope with stress or boredom. You could try replacing porn with other activities that bring you joy or help you relax, like hobbies or spending time with friends.\n\nIt's also important to address the underlying confidence issues that are affecting your studies and presentations. Consider seeking out resources on building self-confidence, such as books, TED talks, or even therapy sessions. Additionally, you might want to try practicing positive self-talk and reframing negative thoughts about yourself.\n\nLastly, since you're a master's student in finance, you might find it helpful to break down your study goals into smaller, manageable tasks.

Don't beat yourself up about it, but recognize it's something you need to actively address.\n\nPractical steps you can take:\n\n1.  **Blockers:** Install website blockers on your phone and computer. There are many options out there, some even let you set a password that only someone else knows, adding an extra layer of accountability.\n2.  **Replace the Habit:** When you feel the urge to watch porn, immediately do something else. This could be exercise, meditation, reading, calling a friend, or working on your studies. The key is to interrupt the thought pattern.\n3.  **Scheduled Study Time:** Treat your online lectures like in-person classes. Find a quiet place, turn off your phone (or put it in another room), and focus solely on the lecture. Break down your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks with short breaks in between. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break) can be really helpful.\n4.  **Address the Underlying Issues:** You mentioned a drop in confidence. Consider exploring why you feel this way. Journaling can be a good way to process your thoughts and feelings. If possible, talking to a therapist or counselor could provide valuable support and guidance.\n5.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn. This could include reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n6.  **Accountability:** Tell a trusted friend or family member about your struggle and ask for their support. Having someone to talk to and hold you accountable can make a big difference.\n\nIt's going to take time and effort, and you'll likely have setbacks. Don't let those setbacks derail you.

Do this multiple times a day, whether you feel like it or not.\n\nSoon the habit of studying starts to form and then you will be studying more often and it won\u2019t seem so unpleasant after a while.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t happen overnight.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're aware of your challenges, which is a great first step. Here\u2019s a simple approach to help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each study session. For example, aim to focus for just 10-15 minutes at a time, then take a short break. Gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a consistent study routine. Having a set time and place for studying can help train your brain to get into \"focus mode.\"\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those. This could mean studying in a quiet place, using apps to block distracting websites, or keeping your phone out of reach.\n\n4. **Use Your Short-Sightedness as a Tool**: Since you mentioned your vision, maybe use it to your advantage. Sit closer to the board or screen if possible, and use it as a reason to focus more intently on what's in front of you.\n\n5. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself a small reward after completing a study session. This could be a snack, a short walk, or a few minutes of a favorite activity.\n\nRemember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"It sounds like you already know what works for you - taking notes and researching what you don't understand. The challenge isn't finding the right strategy, it's getting yourself to actually do it consistently.\n\nStart small. Instead of trying to take perfect notes for every class, commit to just 10 minutes of focused note-taking per day. Set a timer on your phone if you need to. The key is making it so easy that you can't talk yourself out of it.\n\nFor the daydreaming, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique when you catch your mind wandering. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring your attention back to the present moment.\n\nYour short-sightedness is a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. Have you talked to your teachers about sitting closer to the front? Most are happy to accommodate this kind of request. You could also record lectures (with permission) to review later when you can see your screen clearly.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small improvements consistently. Pick one tiny change to implement this week. Once that becomes routine, add another. Over time, these small wins compound into major progress.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're aware of your strengths, like being able to learn through listening and note-taking, but are struggling with motivation. One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle a huge study session, commit to focusing for just 10-15 minutes at a time, and then take a short break. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, try to identify what triggers your daydreaming - is it boredom, stress, or something else? Once you know what's causing it, you can develop strategies to address the root cause. It's also great that you've found ways to adapt to your short-sightedness in the past, so see if you can tap into that resourcefulness again to find ways to stay engaged and motivated. Remember, developing discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time - don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up, just acknowledge the setback and try to do better next time.",

Seriously, just that one small thing. Don't worry about being perfect, just focus on that one action.\n\nAlso, about the eyesight thing \u2013 could you get your glasses updated? Even a small improvement might remove that mental hurdle. If glasses aren't enough, maybe talk to your school's disability services; they might have resources to help you focus.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Everyone struggles with motivation. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Small wins build momentum! Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"Try sitting in a spot where you can see as clearly as possible, and if that still isn\u2019t perfect, jot down key words or phrases you hear so you can look them up later. Even if you\u2019re feeling lazy, promise yourself you\u2019ll do at least a little bit each day\u2014like staying fully focused for the first 10 minutes of class or finishing a short review after school. Once you prove to yourself you can handle those small commitments, it\u2019ll be easier to gradually increase the time you stay on task. If you lose focus, gently pull yourself back to what\u2019s happening in front of you and continue on.

    "comment_claude":"Kudos on planning ahead for your return to school! Starting to build study habits a year in advance is a really smart move. Here's what worked well for me and many others:\n\nStart small - pick one subject you're interested in and dedicate 30 minutes each day to learning about it. This could be through free online courses, textbooks, or educational videos. The specific subject matters less than building the routine of focused learning time.\n\nCreate a dedicated study space at home, even if it's just a corner of a table. Having a consistent spot helps train your brain to focus when you sit down there. Keep it clean and organized, with good lighting and minimal distractions.\n\nTry the Pomodoro technique - study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This helps prevent burnout and makes the process less daunting. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the study intervals.\n\nPractice active recall rather than passive reading. Take notes, summarize key points in your own words, and try explaining concepts out loud. This engages your brain more effectively than just highlighting text.\n\nConsider joining a study group or finding an accountability partner, even before starting school. Local libraries often have adult learning groups, or you could connect with other returning students online.\n\nRemember - you're not starting from zero. Your work experience has taught you valuable skills like time management and problem-solving. Those will definitely help in your academic journey.\n\nStart implementing these habits now, and by the time classes begin, studying will feel much more natural. You've got this!",

This could be reading books related to your desired field, taking online courses, or watching educational videos. The key is to create a habit of consistent learning and reviewing material. You might also consider starting a journal or log to track your progress, note what works for you, and identify areas where you need improvement. Additionally, you could try reaching out to current students or professors in your desired program to get a better understanding of what to expect and how to prepare.

A year is a great runway to get back into the swing of things.\n\nInstead of jumping straight into \"studying,\" maybe start by focusing on building a routine. Pick a subject you're interested in (doesn't even have to be related to your future studies) and dedicate a small amount of time to it each day \u2013 even 15-20 minutes. Consistency is key here. Think of it like warming up a muscle.\n\nExperiment with different learning methods. Try reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, or even just having discussions with people about the topic.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to shake things up and push past that comfort zone. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Set Clear, Specific Goals**: Instead of vague goals like \"I want to grow,\" try setting specific, measurable goals. For example, \"I want to learn a new skill, like coding, and complete an online course in three months.\" This gives you a clear target to aim for.\n\n2. **Break It Down**: Big goals can be overwhelming, so break them into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Discipline often comes from routine. Set aside specific times each day or week dedicated to working on your goals. Consistency is key.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community with similar interests. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and accountable.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. What's working? What's not? Be open to adjusting your approach if needed.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Don't wait until you've achieved the big goal to celebrate. Acknowledge and reward yourself for the small victories along the way.\n\nRemember, growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, so embrace the discomfort as a sign that you're moving in the right direction. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Overcoming complacency starts with recognizing that growth requires deliberate discomfort - you're already ahead by acknowledging this. The key is creating systems that push you forward rather than relying on motivation alone.\n\nStart by setting specific, measurable goals in different areas of your life. Instead of vague aims like \"get better at programming,\" try \"complete one new coding project each month\" or \"learn three new programming concepts weekly.\" This makes progress trackable and gives you clear targets to work toward.\n\nA practical approach is to schedule regular \"growth reviews\" - maybe every Sunday evening. During these sessions, evaluate what you accomplished that week, where you stayed in your comfort zone, and plan one specific way to challenge yourself in the coming week. This builds accountability and keeps growth at the forefront of your mind.\n\nTo consistently push boundaries, try the \"plus one\" method: whatever you're currently doing, add one small challenge. If you read one book monthly, aim for two. If you exercise twice weekly, add a third session. These incremental steps make getting out of your comfort zone more manageable while maintaining steady progress.\n\nRemember that growth isn't always about doing more - sometimes it's about doing different things or approaching familiar tasks in new ways. Mix up your routines, take on projects that scare you a little, and connect with people who inspire you to level up.\n\nThe antidote to procrastination is making the first step ridiculously small. Want to write a book? Start with one paragraph daily. Want to learn a language? Begin with five minutes of practice. These tiny commitments often naturally expand once you're in motion.\n\nYour awareness of complacency is the first step to defeating it.

    "comment_llama":"Overcoming complacency is a great goal to have, and it's awesome that you're recognizing the need for growth in multiple areas of your life. One strategy that might help is to set specific, challenging goals for yourself in different areas, like learning a new skill or taking on a new hobby. Break down these larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to help build momentum and make progress feel more tangible. It's also important to create an environment that encourages growth, whether that means surrounding yourself with people who inspire you, reading books or articles that challenge your perspectives, or seeking out new experiences that push you out of your comfort zone. \n\nAnother approach is to schedule regular \"check-ins\" with yourself, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly, to reflect on your progress and identify areas where you might be getting too comfortable. Ask yourself questions like \"What have I learned recently?\", \"What challenges am I avoiding?\", and \"What small step can I take today to move closer to my goals?\" By regularly assessing your progress and making intentional decisions about how you want to grow, you can start to build a sense of discipline and momentum that helps you overcome complacency. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you find it tough to get out of your comfort zone at first - it's a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

If you want to learn a language, don't aim for fluency right away. Aim for learning 5 new words a day. The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no. Those small wins build momentum and make the bigger picture less daunting.\n\nSecond, actively seek out discomfort. Complacency thrives in comfort zones. Try something new every week, even if it's just a different route to work, a new genre of music, or striking up a conversation with a stranger. The more you expose yourself to the unfamiliar, the less scary it becomes.\n\nThird, find an accountability buddy. Tell someone your goals and ask them to check in on your progress. Knowing someone else is watching can be a powerful motivator.\n\nFinally, remember that growth isn't always linear. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're not making progress. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Good luck, you got this!\n",

    "comment_best_human":"I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter\/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nGood luck!",

One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there - this is actually a really common challenge that many people face. The goal isn't to completely suppress emotions (they're valuable signals), but rather to create some space between feeling and acting so you can make clearer decisions.\n\nHere's what's helped many others in similar situations:\n\nThe \"pause and name\" technique is a good starting point. When you notice strong emotions arising, pause and literally name what you're feeling: \"This is anger\" or \"I'm feeling hopeful right now.\" This small act creates a bit of distance and helps engage your rational mind.\n\nFor bigger decisions, try the 24-hour rule. When emotions are running high, commit to waiting 24 hours before making any significant choices. Write down your thoughts and feelings, then revisit them the next day when you're calmer. You'll often see things differently.\n\nRegular meditation (even just 5-10 minutes daily) can strengthen your ability to observe emotions without being completely swept away by them. Think of it like building a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger this skill becomes.\n\nAlso consider using a decision journal. When facing choices, write down: 1) The situation 2) How you're feeling 3) The logical pros and cons 4) What advice you'd give a friend in the same situation. This helps separate emotional reactions from rational analysis.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to become an emotionless robot - it's to find a healthy balance where feelings inform but don't override your judgment. Start small, be patient with yourself, and build these practices gradually.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with impulsivity driven by your emotions, which is a common challenge many people face. One strategy that might help is practicing mindfulness and meditation to increase your self-awareness and ability to recognize when your emotions are taking over. This can help you create a bit of space between your feelings and your decision-making process, allowing you to evaluate situations more logically. Additionally, trying to reframe your thinking by focusing on the facts of a situation rather than how you feel about it can be beneficial. For example, when faced with a decision, try writing down the pros and cons, or talking through your thoughts with a trusted friend or mentor to get an outside perspective. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and remind yourself of them regularly, so when emotions start to cloud your judgment, you can come back to what you know you want to achieve in the long run. Lastly, consider developing a pre-decision routine that gives you time to reflect on your choices, such as waiting 24 hours before making an important decision, to ensure you're acting on logic rather than impulse. Remember, it's not about suppressing your emotions entirely, but learning to navigate them in a way that allows you to make decisions that align with your values and goals.",

When you feel that strong emotion coming on, try to pause. Literally, just stop and take a few deep breaths. It sounds simple, but it can give you a moment to think.\n\nThen, try to label the emotion. Instead of just feeling overwhelmed, say to yourself, \"Okay, I'm feeling anxious right now,\" or \"I'm feeling really angry.\" Naming it can help you detach from it a little.\n\nAfter that, try writing down the pros and cons of the decision you're facing, focusing on the facts and not the feelings. What are the realistic outcomes? What's the worst that could happen? Sometimes seeing it on paper can bring clarity.\n\nAlso, consider talking to someone you trust \u2013 a friend, family member, or therapist. Just voicing your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see things from a different perspective. You're not alone in this, and it's definitely something you can work on. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to see emotional awareness as a tool rather than something to suppress entirely. Let yourself feel what you\u2019re feeling, but practice giving those emotions a moment to settle before making any decisions. One simple way is to pause and identify exactly what you\u2019re experiencing, then remind yourself of the outcome or goal you\u2019re aiming for. Some people use journaling or a brief daily check-in to sort out what\u2019s driving their choices. It also helps to plan your next move when you\u2019re not in the heat of the moment\u2014like deciding on your response in advance so you\u2019re not purely reacting when an intense emotion comes up. Over time, this approach builds the discipline to acknowledge feelings while staying logically grounded, and it will get easier to choose actions that align with your deeper goals.",

I get bursts of motivation but I feel like I am procrastinating so often. I know they're going to realize I am not doing shit and I am worried about my job. \n\nI used to be able to sit for hours and study math or make art. Maybe because I felt good at it? But I could figure things out and perfect things for so long but my patience and tolerance feels like it is at a 0. Any book recommendations? I want to feel good at what I do and put the work in. I just... don't know what to do. And the good therapist I finally found after many shitty ones has ghosted me and I don't want to go through the process again. I feel like I'm so close to an amazing life with a job that gives me freedom to do other things. But I feel like I'm drowning and I'm so unconfident in my job.

Imposter syndrome is a tough beast, but remember, everyone starts somewhere, and asking questions is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nTo tackle the work anxiety, try setting small, achievable goals each day. This can help build confidence and show progress. Also, consider pairing up with a mentor or a more experienced colleague who can guide you through the learning curve. They can offer insights and reassurance that you're on the right track.\n\nFor your personal life, it might help to schedule regular check-ins with yourself. Reflect on what you want to improve and set realistic steps to get there. It\u2019s okay to take it one day at a time.\n\nAs for book recommendations, \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear is a great read on building habits and discipline. It might give you some practical strategies to regain that focus and patience you mentioned.\n\nLastly, don't give up on finding a therapist. It can be frustrating, but having someone to talk to can make a big difference. You're doing great, and it's clear you're committed to making positive changes.

    "comment_claude":"Your situation is actually pretty common for new software engineers, especially those who've had quick success. The key is to shift from seeing this as an overwhelming challenge to treating it as a growth opportunity that you can tackle systematically.\n\nStart by breaking down your work into smaller, manageable chunks. Pick one small task each day that you know you can complete, even if it seems trivial. This builds momentum and confidence. When you finish that task, document what you learned - this creates a personal knowledge base you can reference later.\n\nFor the focus issues: Set a timer for just 25 minutes of dedicated work. No distractions, just coding. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. You mentioned being able to focus on art and math before - this same ability is still there, it just needs to be rebuilt gradually.\n\nRegarding the job anxiety: Instead of waiting to be \"found out,\" be proactive. Schedule regular check-ins with your lead\/mentor. Come prepared with specific questions and areas where you need guidance. Most tech leads actually respect junior developers who are upfront about their learning needs.\n\nFor immediate reading, check out \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear. It's perfect for rebuilding focus and discipline through small, consistent changes. \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" is also great for developing solid engineering practices.\n\nRemember that your past success in math, art, and even your previous work shows you're capable of mastering complex skills.

It's normal to feel overwhelmed when starting a new role, especially in a field like software engineering where there's always more to learn. \n\nOne thing that might help with your imposter syndrome is to focus on the fact that you were hired for this job, which means your employers believe you have the potential to excel in it. It's okay to not know everything right away, and asking questions is a sign of strength, not weakness. As for procrastination, try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day or week. This can help you build momentum and confidence.\n\nRegarding your motivation and patience, it's possible that you're just feeling burned out from all the changes in your life right now. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and prioritize self-care - whether that means taking a walk, practicing yoga, or simply doing something creative like art. You mentioned you used to be able to focus for hours on math or art, so try to tap back into that part of yourself.\n\nAs for book recommendations, \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" by Stephen Covey and \"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\" by Carol S. Dweck might be helpful in terms of building confidence and developing a growth mindset. Additionally, \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport could provide some useful strategies for overcoming procrastination and staying focused.\n\nLastly, don't give up on finding a good therapist - it's worth the effort to find someone who can support you through this challenging time. And try not to worry too much about losing your job - you've made it this far, and with time and practice, you'll become more confident in your abilities.

Instead of focusing on what you *don't* know, try to track what you *are* learning each week. Even small things. Write them down. It'll help you see your progress and build confidence. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help, but try to frame your questions as \"I've tried X and Y, and I'm still stuck on Z. Any suggestions?\" This shows initiative.\n\nFor getting back into a productive groove, maybe start small. Instead of trying to sit for hours like you used to, aim for 25-minute focused sessions (Pomodoro Technique). Then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. It's easier to build momentum that way.\n\nAs for books, \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear is a classic for building good habits and breaking bad ones. It's really practical and easy to implement.

    "comment_best_human":"I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.\n\nIn my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice.

    "comment_claude":"What you're describing sounds like paralysis by analysis - getting so caught up in worry about potential outcomes that you can't take the first step. Here's what's helped others break through this:\n\nStart ridiculously small. Instead of thinking \"I need to complete this whole assignment,\" tell yourself \"I'm just going to open the textbook and read one paragraph.\" Or \"I'll just write one sentence.\" Make it so easy that the fear can't get a grip on you.\n\nThe 5-minute rule can be really powerful here. Commit to working on something for just 5 minutes. After that, you can stop if you want to. What usually happens is that once you start, you'll often want to continue since the hardest part - getting started - is over.\n\nAnother technique is to reframe the task. Instead of seeing it as something you need to do perfectly, view it as an experiment or practice run. You're not committing to a final product, you're just exploring and learning. This takes some pressure off.\n\nRemember that doing something imperfectly is infinitely better than doing nothing at all. Every attempt, even if it doesn't turn out great, teaches you something and builds your confidence for next time.\n\nTry setting up a reward system for starting tasks early. Maybe after working on an assignment ahead of schedule, you get to do something you enjoy. This helps create positive associations instead of just responding to deadline pressure.\n\nThe key is to make starting feel safe and low-stakes.

It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, and reward yourself when you reach them. This can help build confidence and make it feel less daunting to start tasks.

    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that feeling of being paralyzed by fear when facing tasks, especially schoolwork. It's like the fear of failure is worse than the actual work itself.\n\nOne thing that might help is breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Seriously, so small they seem silly. Instead of \"study for history,\" it's \"open the history book.\" That's it. Then, if you feel up to it, \"read one paragraph.\" The point is to make the initial hurdle so low that you can't possibly fail. This can help you build momentum and reduce that initial fear.\n\nAnother thing to consider is focusing on the process, not the outcome. Instead of thinking about the grade you'll get, think about how much time you'll spend studying. Set a timer for 25 minutes (Pomodoro Technique) and tell yourself you'll just focus for that amount of time. No pressure to ace anything, just focus for 25 minutes. When the timer goes off, take a break.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel scared. Acknowledge the fear, but don't let it control you. Maybe even try writing down what you're afraid of. Sometimes just getting it out of your head can make it less powerful. Good luck, you got this!\n",

Once you realize you survived those ten minutes, you might feel less pressure and keep going. Another technique is to remind yourself that perfection isn\u2019t the immediate goal; getting something on paper is better than nothing at all. Even if it\u2019s not perfect, you can refine it later. Over time, these small successes add up and your brain learns that starting isn\u2019t as scary as it seems.

I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for.

If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point.

Start with something simple, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a new hobby or skill. It doesn't have to be perfect or big, just something that you can stick to and gradually build on.\n\nConsider exploring interests outside of your current job.

Those thoughts you're having are serious, and while medication helps keep you above water, you might benefit from working with a therapist who can give you additional tools to manage those thoughts.

Writing, research, communication, and critical thinking are valuable in many fields. Have you considered content marketing, technical writing, or corporate communications?

Your degree isn't useless - it just might need to be applied differently than you originally planned.\n\nStart small with building discipline.

Finding the right medication can make a massive difference. Also, have you considered therapy? Talking to someone might help you process those thoughts and develop coping mechanisms.\n\nAs for the rest, let's break it down. You feel stuck with your job and degree.

It may not feel like much at first, but stacking those small wins can remind you that it\u2019s possible to move forward even when everything feels overwhelming. You could consider looking into trade schools or certifications that teach concrete, in-demand skills\u2014writing ability can still be an asset, but adding a specialized credential can open new doors too. Most importantly, you don\u2019t have to tackle everything at once. Pick one small goal (like completing a short online course or reaching out to someone in a career you\u2019re curious about) and commit to it for a few weeks. Gradually building momentum with these manageable steps can help shift your mindset and show you there are still paths to grow, even if they\u2019re not the ones you initially planned. And if the negative thoughts are too heavy, reaching out for professional help or connecting with a support group can give you the ground to keep going while working on your goals day by day. It\u2019s not about a perfect plan\u2014just experimental steps in a direction that gives you hope.",

    "post_body":"So I'm 18, no job, and I kinda fucked up my college life. I haven't done a single thing for the first semester of college and now my second semester is coming up in a few days, and now one of my scholarship funding sources are asking for my grades. WHAT DO I DO?!\n\nYou might be wondering how this happened...well...\n\nI have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \"content\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.\n\nAnother problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.\n\nEven when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\n\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say \"I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say \"just do it\", but it doesn't work like that.\n\nFor stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination. Could I get some strong advice for someone who has suffered through a strong addiction of some sort?\n\nEdit: Should I skip this second semester entirely to fix myself before I get back to college?

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice\u2014recognizing the need for change is a big first step. Let's tackle this one step at a time.\n\nFor your college situation, honesty is usually the best policy. It might be tough, but consider having a candid conversation with your dad and the scholarship committee. Explain that you struggled with the transition and are actively working on improving. They might appreciate your honesty and determination to do better.\n\nRegarding your habits, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. Since blockers haven't worked, try changing your environment. If possible, study in a library or a caf\u00e9 where distractions are minimized. Also, set small, achievable goals for each day. Instead of thinking about the entire semester, focus on completing one assignment or studying for one hour. Celebrate these small wins to build momentum.\n\nFor the social anxiety, consider reaching out to your college's counseling services. They can offer support and strategies to manage anxiety, which might help you feel more comfortable tackling these conversations and responsibilities.\n\nLastly, about skipping the semester, weigh the pros and cons. If you think taking a break will help you reset and come back stronger, it might be worth considering. But if you feel you can manage with some adjustments, maybe try to push through with a lighter course load.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to ask for help along the way. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First - don't skip next semester. Taking a break won't magically fix these issues, and it's harder to return once you step away. Instead, let's tackle this head-on.\n\nYou need to come clean with your dad and the scholarship office ASAP. It's going to be rough, but being honest now is better than letting it get worse. Explain that you struggled with the transition to college and managing your time, but you have a concrete plan to improve (which we'll get to). Most scholarship programs have academic probation periods rather than immediate cancellation.\n\nFor the addiction and procrastination - your brain is stuck in a dopamine loop. Those quick hits from games and adult content are way more appealing than delayed rewards from studying. The kitchen wandering is your brain seeking novelty when deprived of its usual stimulation.\n\nHere's what you do:\nStart ridiculously small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE class next semester and commit to attending every single lecture, sitting in the front row. Just showing up consistently will begin rewiring your reward pathways.\n\nGet out of your room to study. Go to the library or a coffee shop where you can't access explicit content. The environment change helps break patterns.\n\nSet a timer for just 25 minutes of focused work. When urges hit, tell yourself you only have to wait until the timer ends. Often you'll find you want to continue once you start.\n\nReplace the gaming\/adult content with something physical - pushups, walking, anything. You need an alternative outlet for that restless energy.\n\nMost importantly - forgive yourself but don't give up. You're 18 and figuring things out. Many students struggle their first semester. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you want to change. Keep reading Atomic Habits, and remember that small consistent actions compound over time.\n\nYou've got this. Start with being honest about where you are, then take it one tiny step at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're facing a tough situation, but acknowledging your problems and seeking help is a huge step forward. First, let's break down the issues into manageable parts. For your college situation, it might be helpful to have an honest conversation with your dad, but maybe frame it as a fresh start for the second semester rather than dwelling on what went wrong in the first. You could say something like, \"I didn't do as well as I hoped last semester, but I'm committed to turning things around this semester.\" As for your scholarship, you might want to reach out to them and explain that you're working on getting back on track, and see if they have any resources or support available to help you succeed.\n\nRegarding your procrastination and addiction, it's great that you're looking into \"Atomic Habits\" - the book has some really useful strategies for building positive habits and breaking negative ones. One thing you might find helpful is to start small, like setting aside a specific time each day to work on your goals without any distractions. It could also be beneficial to identify your triggers for procrastination (like the kitchen chair or walking around the house) and find ways to mitigate them, such as investing in a more comfortable chair or finding a different workspace.\n\nIt's also important to address your underlying issues, like your hentai addiction and social anxiety. You might consider seeking out professional help, like a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with personalized guidance and support. Additionally, there are many online resources and communities available that can offer help and accountability as you work to overcome your addiction.\n\nAs for skipping the second semester, it's not necessarily a bad idea if you feel like you need time to get your life together before diving back into college. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of taking a break, such as losing momentum or falling behind your peers. Maybe you could try to find a compromise, like taking a reduced course load or focusing on one or two classes that you're really interested in, while also working on your personal issues.\n\nRemember, overcoming addiction and building discipline is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be kind to yourself and don't give up - you've already taken the first step by acknowledging your problems and seeking help.",
    "comment_gemini":"Okay, deep breaths. You're 18, and while it feels like the world is ending, you've got time to turn things around. It's awesome you're already looking into Atomic Habits \u2013 that's a solid start.\n\nFirst, the college stuff. Honesty is the best policy, but it needs to be delivered carefully. With your dad and the scholarship, could you frame it as \"I had a really rough transition to college and struggled more than I anticipated. My grades aren't where they need to be, and I'm working on a plan to improve.\" Then, *immediately* follow that with your plan. This shows you're taking responsibility.\n\nAs for the plan, consider talking to your college advisor ASAP. Explain the situation. They might have resources like tutoring, counseling, or even a way to retroactively withdraw from some classes. Don't skip the second semester without talking to them first \u2013 you might be able to salvage something.\n\nNow, the addiction and procrastination. You're right, \"just do it\" doesn't work. You've identified the triggers (boredom, stress, easy access). Since blockers aren't working, try a more drastic approach: can you move your computer to a more public space in your house? Or even better, do your work at the library? Out of sight, out of mind can be powerful.\n\nRegarding the random kitchen trips and naps, that sounds like avoidance. Your brain is looking for anything other than the task at hand. Break down your work into *tiny* chunks. Like, \"I will work on this assignment for 15 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.\" Set a timer. During the break, do something completely different \u2013 stretch, listen to music, *not* games or anything addictive. The Pomodoro Technique might be helpful here.\n\nAlso, address the chair situation. A comfortable workspace makes a huge difference. Even a cheap ergonomic chair from a used furniture store would be an improvement.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix everything overnight. Celebrate small wins. If you manage to work for 30 minutes without distractions, that's a victory! Acknowledge it. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. And seriously, talk to your college advisor. They've seen it all before and can offer valuable guidance. You got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019d start by talking to an academic adviser or counselor at your college. Explain that you struggled badly but want to turn things around because they can often point you toward resources or ways to salvage credits. It\u2019s scary, but ownership of your mistakes can show your scholarship providers and your dad that you\u2019re taking real steps to fix this. If you decide to continue next semester, try restructuring your day so there\u2019s less time alone in your room\u2014study in the library or a campus lounge, and if possible, get an accountability partner or friend who checks in on you. For the hentai and gaming habits, make it harder to access them: move your console or PC somewhere else, or keep your phone in another room when studying. It might feel weird at first, but the less those temptations are within your immediate reach, the better. Atomic Habits is great, but don\u2019t pressure yourself to read it perfectly in one go; just apply one small tip at a time, like creating a five-minute \u201cstudy ritual\u201d you do every day. If you really feel you can\u2019t handle the semester, talk to an advisor about taking a leave of absence, but don\u2019t just disappear. The biggest mistake would be staying silent, because honesty usually opens up more options than you think. Work on one piece at a time, keep your environment less tempting, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help\u2014people on campus are used to seeing students get stuck and bounce back.

I\u2019ve learnt new perspectives from every single comment. This is awesome. Thank you once again \ud83e\udd70\n\nTo summarize \n\n1) Go on dopamine fasting. Rewire my brain to get used to lower doses of dopamine hit. Swear off social media\n\n2) Replace downtime with something constructive, that I can grow over time. Be deliberate about what the replacement activities are before going on dopamine fast. Examples of replacement activities are reading, journaling, exercising, learning a new language, trying to make art\u2026\n\n3) Examine what is causing me to get into social media apps, beyond the dopamine factor. Social media is not my support network. Few books mentioned are Wilpower instinct, Atomic habits, Digital Minimization, the Molecule of more \n\n4) Out of sight out of mind.

    "comment_best_human":"It is called Revenge Procrastination. Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.",
    "comment_10th_human":"I\u2019m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary \u2018A Social Dilemma\u2019. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it\u2019s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere\u2019s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n\u201cEach time you\u2019re swiping down, it\u2019s like a slot machine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. Sometimes it\u2019s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it\u2019s just an ad.\u201d What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the \u2018pull to refresh\u2019 function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline\u2014whether that\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email\u2014we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising \u2018likes\u2019 or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what\u2019s called \u2018ludic loops\u2019\u2014where a user is unsure whether they\u2019ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation\u2014is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.\u201d\n\nLink: https:\/\/www.we-heart.com\/2019\/09\/04\/social-media-and-the-slot-machine\/\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media.

    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of needing to unwind after a long day, but the way you're doing it is actually counterproductive. After such intense work, your brain craves a break, and social media offers quick, easy dopamine hits. The problem is, it can become a cycle that disrupts your sleep and productivity. \n\nTo break this habit, try setting a specific time limit for social media use in the evening, maybe 30 minutes, and stick to it. Use apps that can help you enforce these limits. Also, consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve screens\u2014like reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. \n\nRemember, it's about finding balance. You don't have to cut out social media entirely, but being mindful of how and when you use it can make a big difference. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"What you're experiencing is a common \"revenge bedtime procrastination\" pattern. After intense analytical work, your brain is still in high-gear and craving easy stimulation - social media provides that quick hit of novelty and entertainment.\n\nThe key is creating a proper wind-down routine that helps transition your mind from work mode to rest mode. When you finish work, try setting a 30-minute timer for your social media use. Once it goes off, switch to calming activities like reading a physical book, light stretching, or journaling. The physical separation from your phone is crucial here.\n\nYou might also want to experiment with a \"shutdown ritual\" - a consistent set of actions that signal to your brain that work is done for the day. This could be as simple as writing down tomorrow's tasks, clearing your desk, and changing into comfortable clothes.\n\nFor immediate practical steps: Move your phone charger away from your bed, use app blockers after certain hours, and switch your phone to grayscale mode in the evening. Having a glass of water and doing some deep breathing exercises can help too.\n\nRemember that those 16-hour workdays are intense - your brain needs genuine downtime to process and recover. Building in proper breaks and rest periods will actually make you more productive in the long run than pushing through and falling into the social media trap.\n\nThe fact that you're aware of this pattern and seeking to change it is already a huge step.

This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, practicing some light stretches, or reading a book. By doing so, you can start to associate the end of the workday with relaxation rather than mindless scrolling. \n\nIt's also great that you're recognizing the importance of understanding the underlying causes of your behavior and not just treating the symptoms. Exploring books like \"Willpower Instinct\" and \"Atomic Habits\" can definitely provide valuable insights into building better habits and self-control.

Here are a few tips that might help you get a handle on it:\n\n1. **Awareness**: Start by tracking your spending. Use an app or a simple notebook to jot down every purchase. This will help you see patterns and understand where your money is going.\n\n2. **Budgeting**: Set a budget for yourself. Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each month. Once you hit that limit, try to hold off on more purchases.\n\n3. **Delay Gratification**: When you feel the urge to buy something, wait 24 hours before making the purchase. This can help you determine if you really need it or if it's just an impulse buy.\n\n4. **Find Alternatives**: Since shopping is a way to cope with negative feelings, try to find other activities that make you feel good. This could be exercising, reading, or even just going for a walk.\n\n5. **Set Goals**: Think about what you want to save for. Having a clear goal can make it easier to resist unnecessary purchases because you know your money is going towards something important.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection.

    "comment_claude":"Thanks for being open about your spending habits - recognizing the pattern is an important first step. What you're describing sounds like emotional spending, and there are practical ways to get it under control.\n\nStart by creating a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before any non-essential purchase. When you feel the urge to buy something, add it to a wishlist instead of your cart. After 24 hours, you'll often find the emotional trigger has passed and you no longer want the item.\n\nFor immediate help managing impulse buys, delete shopping apps from your phone and unsubscribe from promotional emails. These constant reminders and easy-access shopping make it much harder to break the habit.\n\nSet up automatic transfers to move money into a separate savings account as soon as you get paid. This creates a psychological barrier - you'll think twice before moving money back to spend it. Even starting with a small amount helps build the saving habit.\n\nWhen you feel those negative emotions coming on, have alternative activities ready that don't involve spending. Could be going for a walk, calling a friend, working out, or any hobby that gives you a similar mood boost. The key is breaking the automatic link between feeling bad and shopping.\n\nTrack your spending for a month in detail. Sometimes seeing the real numbers in black and white can be eye-opening and motivating. Use this to create a realistic budget that includes some \"fun money\" - being too restrictive often backfires.\n\nRemember that changing financial habits takes time. Focus on progress rather than perfection, and be proud of each small win along the way.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're using shopping as a way to cope with negative emotions, which is a pretty common phenomenon. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - in your case, it seems like feeling sad or mad at someone can set you off. When you feel those emotions coming on, try to pause and do something else instead of reaching for your wallet. This could be going for a walk, calling a friend, or doing some exercise - anything that can help distract you from the urge to shop. \n\nAnother thing you might find helpful is to implement a 30-day rule: when you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before actually making the purchase. This can help you figure out if the item is something you really need or if the desire to buy it was just an impulsive want. You could also try setting up a budget and prioritizing your spending - make a list of what you need to save for, and see if you can allocate your money towards those goals instead of impulse purchases.\n\nIt might also be helpful to find other ways to cope with your emotions that don't involve spending money. Could you try journaling, meditation, or talking to a therapist? These can be really powerful tools for managing negative feelings without breaking the bank. Remember, developing self-control and better spending habits takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't get too discouraged if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and keep moving forward.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to use shopping as a way to cope, but it definitely sounds like you're ready to make a change.\n\nFirst, try to identify your triggers. You mentioned feeling sad or mad \u2013 keep a little journal for a week or two and jot down what you're feeling right before you get the urge to shop. Recognizing those feelings is the first step.\n\nNext, create some friction. Unsubscribe from marketing emails, delete shopping apps from your phone, and maybe even avoid going to the mall if that's a trigger. The harder it is to shop impulsively, the better.\n\nAlso, try to find healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of shopping when you're feeling down, try going for a walk, listening to music, or talking to a friend. It might not give you the same immediate rush, but it'll be better for you in the long run.\n\nFinally, set some financial goals. Having a specific reason to save money (like a vacation, a new car, or just a safety net) can make it easier to resist impulse buys. Maybe even create a separate savings account specifically for that goal and track your progress. You got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"One simple trick is to put a cooling-off period between feeling the urge to buy something and actually purchasing it, even if it\u2019s just 24 hours. Often, that impulse fades once you step away. Another way is to automate your savings so part of your paycheck goes straight to a separate account you don\u2019t touch\u2014out of sight, out of mind. It also helps to remove card details from websites or apps you frequently use; having to enter everything manually makes you think twice. If shopping feels like emotional relief, try to channel that energy into something else you enjoy (like a quick walk, a hobby, or talking with a friend).

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's great that you're motivated to do so many things. The key here is to prioritize and manage your time effectively. Start by identifying your top priorities\u2014what's most important to you right now? Focus on those and be okay with not doing everything at once. It's also helpful to create a schedule or routine that includes time for rest and relaxation. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly, but about making consistent progress. You might also want to try habit stacking, where you pair a new habit with an existing one, to make it easier to incorporate into your day.

Maybe that's work, studying, and family time. Focus on those first. Then choose 1-2 smaller activities that bring you joy (like piano) and schedule them in smaller chunks. 15-30 minutes of focused practice is better than no practice at all.\n\nAs you get better at managing your core priorities, you'll naturally find ways to fit in other activities. Some things might need to wait until you have more time or energy - and that's perfectly fine. Life is long, and you don't need to master everything right now.\n\nRemember that successful people aren't doing everything every day. They're doing a few important things consistently well.

The key is to realize that you don't have to do everything at once, and that prioritization is crucial. Instead of trying to fit in every single activity, try to identify your top 3-4 non-negotiables - the things that are most important to you, like studying, working, and spending time with family. Once you've got those covered, you can start allocating smaller chunks of time to other activities, like learning piano or reading. It's also important to learn to say no to things that aren't essential, and to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly - it's about making progress and being consistent. You've already made some great strides in the past year, so keep building on that momentum!

    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It feels like there's never enough time in the day, right? The truth is, you probably *can't* do absolutely everything. And that's okay! The key is prioritization and being realistic.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that you're already making progress. You said you've become more productive, which is awesome! Build on that momentum.\n\nInstead of trying to do everything at once, try focusing on a few key areas. What are the 2-3 things that would make the biggest difference in your life right now? Maybe it's studying and working, or learning piano and working out. Focus on those first.\n\nThen, break those down into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of \"learn piano,\" it's \"practice piano for 15 minutes, 3 times a week.\" Instead of \"workout,\" it's \"go for a 30-minute walk on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\"\n\nAlso, be honest with yourself about what you *actually* enjoy. Maybe watching movies isn't as important as reading books, or vice versa. Don't feel pressured to do things just because you think you *should*.\n\nFinally, remember to schedule in rest and downtime. You can't pour from an empty cup. If you're constantly running on fumes, you'll burn out quickly.

    "comment_o1":"It helps to accept that doing everything at once simply isn\u2019t possible, so start by picking your top priorities and figuring out how much time you can realistically give to each. You might devote a few focused hours a week to learning piano instead of trying to practice daily. Or you could batch certain tasks\u2014like cooking meals for a few days at once\u2014so you\u2019re not always in the kitchen. Use a basic schedule to block out chunks of time and then commit to following it, even if it\u2019s just one hour of studying, half an hour of practice, and a quick workout. Doing less but doing it consistently will add up over time. It\u2019s less about hitting every ambition at full force every day and more about finding a balanced pace that you can actually sustain. It also helps to recognize that you\u2019ll have seasons of life where you focus more on work or study, and others where you have space to dive into extra pursuits. By being selective and consistent, you\u2019ll get to see progress without burning yourself out trying to juggle everything all at once.",

I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. \n\nMy mom doesn\u2019t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her\/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it\u2019s been many many years (10+).\n\nI also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes\/money to go out.

Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma.

If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\n\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone's journey is different, and it's great that you're actively seeking ways to improve your situation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. **Job Situation**: Since your hours were reduced, it's smart that you're looking for additional part-time work. Keep applying and consider jobs that might offer more hours or better pay. Even if they're not in your ideal field, they can help you save up and gain more independence.\n\n2. **Education**: If you can manage it financially and time-wise, continuing with your class is a good idea. Education can open doors, but it doesn't have to be a full-time commitment right now. Maybe look into online courses or certifications that are affordable and can boost your skills.\n\n3. **Budgeting**: Try to track your expenses and see if there are areas where you can save more. Every little bit helps when you're working towards moving out.\n\n4. **Communication with Your Mom**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your mom about your goals and how she can support you in becoming more independent. Maybe there's a way to gradually take on more responsibilities that can help prove your capability.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be where you are. Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and celebrate the progress you make along the way.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.

    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not \"behind in life.\" There's no universal timeline, especially given how expensive housing has become. Many people in their 20s live with family while building towards independence.\n\nThat said, it sounds like your current situation isn't healthy. Your mom telling you you're \"incapable of functioning\" is concerning and likely affecting your confidence. The fact that you're working, studying, doing housework, and actively trying to improve shows you ARE capable.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\nMake a clear financial plan. Track every dollar you spend and earn. The $500 you're paying for storage could be going towards your own place or more classes. Talk to your mom about selling that stuff or finding a cheaper storage solution.\n\nDon't quit school, but do look for full-time work. Many companies offer tuition assistance - this could help you take more classes. A degree generally leads to better opportunities, but you can work on both simultaneously.\n\nStart building your independence in steps. Open your own phone plan. Take over your grocery expenses. Each small step builds confidence and practical skills. Look for roommate situations - this can make rent much more manageable while you're getting established.\n\nMost importantly, recognize that you're already taking positive steps. Working part-time, studying, and actively seeking solutions are all signs of someone who's capable and motivated. Keep building on that momentum, but be strategic about where you put your energy and resources.\n\nFocus on what you can control and change today, rather than feeling ashamed about the past.

    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, but the fact that you're recognizing your situation and wanting to make changes is a huge step. First, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to live with their parents into their 20s or even 30s, especially with the rising costs of living. \n\nIt seems like you have a few different goals competing for priority - becoming independent, finishing your education, and finding better work. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe focus on making progress in one area at a time. For example, you could try to increase your income by taking on more hours or finding a better-paying job, which would give you more financial stability and autonomy. \n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your goals and aspirations. It's possible that she's not aware of how her comments are affecting you, and talking it through could help clear the air and give you a better understanding of each other's perspectives.\n\nAs for whether to prioritize independence or education, it's not necessarily an either-or situation. You could try to find ways to balance both, like taking online classes or finding a job that offers tuition reimbursement. And it's definitely not stupid to work \"shitty jobs\" without a degree - many people have to start at the bottom and work their way up, and having some kind of income can give you the freedom to pursue other opportunities.\n\nRemember that becoming independent is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're already taking classes and paying your mom rent, which shows that you're capable of taking care of yourself to some extent.

Don't beat yourself up too much; everyone's journey is different.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the immediate issue: independence. It seems like you're stuck in a cycle where your mom's expectations are holding you back. You need a clear, actionable plan to break free.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily quit school *entirely*, but maybe scale back to focus on work for a bit. One class is manageable, but if it's a huge stressor, consider pausing. The goal is to get some financial breathing room.\n\nPrioritize finding better\/more work. \"Shitty\" jobs aren't stupid if they're a stepping stone. Look for opportunities with potential for growth or skills development, even if they're not glamorous. Think about what skills you have or can easily learn (customer service, data entry, etc.) and target those areas. Temp agencies can be a good way to get your foot in the door.\n\nCreate a detailed budget. Track every penny coming in and going out. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and where you can cut back. It will also help you set realistic savings goals.\n\nStart small with savings. Even $25 a week adds up. The key is consistency. Automate it if you can, so it happens without you having to think about it.\n\nTalk to your mom. Have an honest conversation about your goals and your need for independence. Set clear boundaries and expectations. This might be difficult, but it's crucial. Explain that you appreciate her help, but you need to learn to stand on your own two feet. Maybe even propose a timeline for moving out, even if it's a year or two down the road.\n\nAs for the storage unit situation, that's a tricky one. Maybe suggest helping her list some of the items online to generate some extra income. It could be a win-win.\n\nUltimately, it's about taking small, consistent steps towards your goals. Focus on building your financial stability first, then revisit the degree question later. You've got this!\n",

If working extra hours or finding a better-paying job allows you to save up and move out sooner, it might be worth doing before pursuing a full load of coursework. Write out a plan each month\u2014how much you\u2019ll earn, how much you\u2019ll spend, and how much you\u2019ll save. Small steps might feel slow, but consistency is what gets you off the treadmill.

The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the \"pain\" associated with those.\n\nFor bad habits, it will take discipline, but there are some things you can do:\n\nAs you've pointed out, bad habits are almost always coping mechanisms.

If you can tackle even some of those, you should see less of the bad behaviour. \n\nSecond, try to find an alternative. \n\nFor a better understanding: smoking and eating can help deal with stress. That goes back to prehistoric times when there was often danger. If you were eating, it was because you found a safe place to do so. Even today eating or smoking send signals to your brain like \"I'm eating\/chewing, so I must be safe right now\" which helps against stress.\n\nChewing gum would give you a similar effect but without the bad consequences.\n\nAnd probably the easiest thing to start with, change your environment.

Making the harder but better choice often starts with small, manageable steps. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one area to focus on first. Maybe it's reducing Uber Eats orders or setting a small budget for groceries. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what \"better\" looks like for you. Is it cooking one meal at home per day? Walking for 10 minutes? Having a tidy room? Clear goals can guide your actions.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Establish a simple daily routine. It could be as basic as waking up at the same time, making your bed, or having a set time for meals. Routines can provide structure and reduce decision fatigue.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community (like this one!) to keep you accountable. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can make a big difference.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and setbacks happen. Don't beat yourself up over them. Acknowledge the slip and refocus on your goals.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Making better choices is tough because our brains are wired to take the path of least resistance. The key isn't willpower - it's about making the better choice the easier choice through small, strategic changes.\n\nStart with just one thing. Looking at your situation, I'd suggest tackling the food\/Uber Eats cycle first since it impacts both your health and finances. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on prepping just one meal the night before work. When you're tired after your shift, you'll already have food ready - making the healthier choice the convenient one.\n\nFor the morning Uber rides, pack your work bag and lay out clothes the night before. This removes decision fatigue and makes it easier to catch regular transportation. Small prep steps like this reduce the mental friction that leads to costly convenience choices.\n\nAbout the gaming laptop - hold off for now. Put that money toward clearing any food delivery debt and creating a small emergency fund. Gaming can be a great hobby, but timing matters.\n\nThe most important thing is to stop viewing discipline as an all-or-nothing proposition. You don't need to transform overnight. Pick one small change, make it stupid easy to do, and build from there. Each tiny win creates momentum for the next one.\n\nWant a concrete first step? Tonight, take 10 minutes to prep tomorrow's lunch. That's it. One meal, one day. Then come back here and let us know how it went. Sometimes the hardest part is just starting.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of areas in your life where you'd like to see improvement, and that's completely understandable. One strategy that might help is to focus on making one or two small changes at a time, rather than trying to tackle everything all at once. For example, you could start by committing to cook one meal at home each day using ingredients you already have, instead of ordering Uber Eats. Or, you could try setting aside 10 minutes each morning to tidy up your room and get yourself organized for the day. \n\nAs for why it's hard to choose the better option, it's often because our brains are wired to prioritize short-term comfort and convenience over long-term benefits. But the good news is that discipline is like a muscle that can be developed over time with practice and consistency. It might help to identify the underlying reasons why you're making certain choices - for instance, are you using food as a coping mechanism because you're stressed or bored? Once you understand what's driving your behaviors, you can start working on alternative solutions that address those underlying needs.\n\nIt's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now, and it's great that you're taking the first step by recognizing the changes you want to make. Consider seeking out some additional resources or support to help you on your journey - there are many books, podcasts, and online communities dedicated to helping people develop healthier habits and improve their discipline.

This can help minimize anxiety-inducing reminders throughout the day.\n\nRemember that your worth isn't tied to your hair, and the habits you're building are making you stronger both physically and mentally. Take it one day at a time, and celebrate the small wins - whether that's completing a workout, having a good study session, or simply showing up for yourself despite feeling down. The ability to push through tough times is a skill that gets stronger with practice.",
    "comment_llama":"It's really tough when unexpected issues like your hair loss come up and derail your momentum. First, take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed - it doesn't mean you've failed or that all your progress is lost. When life throws you curveballs, it's essential to reassess and adjust your goals temporarily. Consider taking a break from the gym if the stress of people noticing your hair loss is too much, and focus on smaller, manageable tasks like short walks or some light stretching at home. For studying, try breaking it down into even shorter sessions than before, so it feels less daunting. Remember, discipline is not about being perfect; it's about being consistent and kind to yourself, especially during difficult times. You might also want to look into ways to manage your hair loss, like talking to a doctor or finding a supportive community online - sometimes tackling the root cause (no pun intended) can help you regain control and confidence. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's okay to not be okay right now.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, that sounds really rough, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling down. Hair loss can be a huge hit to your confidence.\n\nFirst off, have you seen a doctor about the hair loss? It could be a medical issue that's treatable, and getting that checked out might ease some anxiety.\n\nAs for pushing through the slump, try to focus on what you *can* control. You were going to the gym and studying \u2013 those are great habits! Even if you can't do them at the same intensity right now, try to maintain them in some form. Maybe shorter workouts or just reviewing notes for a bit. The key is to keep the momentum going, even if it's slow.\n\nAlso, consider breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of \"study a bit,\" try \"read one chapter.\" Instead of \"go to the gym,\" try \"walk for 20 minutes.\" Small wins can build you back up.\n\nFinally, ignore the comments about your hair as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know, but remind yourself that their comments say more about them than about you. Focus on taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. You got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to remember that a setback doesn\u2019t negate the progress you\u2019ve already made.

You might want to check in with a medical professional about your hair loss for peace of mind and practical guidance. In the meantime, keep focusing on small victories each day: a short workout or a few minutes of study can reaffirm your discipline and remind you that you\u2019re still moving forward. Sometimes just knowing you kept your habit, no matter how small, can keep you from falling into a deeper slump.",

    "comment_best_human":"I don't remember where I read this, but here's some insight from an internet stranger:\n\nThe thoughts\/opinions that best define you're character\/personality  aren't your very first thoughts on a subject, but your second ones.\n\nThe first opinions that come to your mind are usually snap judgements that involve little thought and so they tend to reflect close associations your brain has made, aka biases(even if they might not be logical), and so they are mostly determined by the environment you were raised in.\n\nOn the other hand, the second opinions you form about a subject require you to put in some more thought into it, which forces you to be more rational in your judgement, because you can apply you're reasoning skills now.\n\nTherefore, your second thoughts on a subject are a much better reflection of character because they reveal how rational you are, and how much you let your own biases influence you.\n\nIf you are already recognizing that you're initial reactions around poc are irrational and caused by your personal bias against them, then you are already going in the right direction.\n\nGood luck with your problem, and remember, everyone has their own biases, what's important is that you don't let them override your reason. Biases are just mental hurdles meant to be overcome.",

    "comment_gpt4":"It's great that you're recognizing these thoughts and want to change. Here are a few steps that might help you work on this:\n\n1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning more about the cultures and histories of the groups you find yourself judging. Understanding the context and experiences of others can help break down stereotypes.\n\n2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it's based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\n\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\n\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\n\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds. Listening to their stories and perspectives can be eye-opening and help you grow.\n\nRemember, change takes time and effort, but acknowledging the problem is a huge first step. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself as you work through this.",
    "comment_claude":"Recognizing these thought patterns and wanting to change them is a great first step. Breaking free from prejudiced thinking takes conscious effort and practice, but it's absolutely achievable through discipline and intentional habit-building.\n\nStart by catching yourself in the moment when these thoughts arise. Instead of letting them flow automatically, pause and actively challenge them. Ask yourself: \"What evidence actually supports this view? Am I making unfair generalizations? What other factors might explain this situation?\"\n\nA practical approach is to deliberately expose yourself to perspectives and stories that humanize people from different backgrounds. Find documentaries, books, or podcasts created by people from the groups you have biases against. Learning about individual experiences and achievements helps break down stereotypes.\n\nAnother effective technique is to practice \"replacement thinking.\" When you notice a prejudiced thought, immediately replace it with a more rational, fact-based observation. For example, if you catch yourself thinking \"that's typical of [race],\" consciously shift to \"that's typical of individuals who make poor choices, regardless of background.\"\n\nRemember that changing thought patterns takes time. Be patient with yourself while remaining committed to improvement. Each time you successfully challenge and redirect a biased thought, you're building new neural pathways and better habits of thinking.\n\nConsider keeping a private journal to track your progress and reflect on what triggers these thoughts. This can help you identify patterns and measure your improvement over time.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change harmful thought patterns, so kudos to you for recognizing the issue and seeking help. Recognizing and challenging our own biases is a difficult but crucial step in personal growth. One strategy that might help is to practice critical thinking when consuming media - ask yourself if the narrative being presented is balanced, if it's perpetuating stereotypes, and what other factors might be at play. Additionally, try to seek out diverse perspectives and engage with content that challenges your existing views. When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and reflect on why you're thinking that way - is it based on personal experience, or is it a product of societal conditioning? By becoming more aware of your thoughts and actively working to reframe them, you can start to break down those biases. It's also important to remember that having racist thoughts doesn't define your worth as a person, but rather it's an opportunity to learn and grow. You might consider exploring resources on unconscious bias, privilege, and social justice to help broaden your understanding. Remember, changing thought patterns takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep working towards a more empathetic and inclusive mindset.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it's really commendable that you're recognizing these thoughts and wanting to change them. That takes courage.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with ingrained biases, and breaking those down takes conscious effort and discipline. One thing that might help is actively seeking out positive stories and perspectives from the groups you're having these thoughts about. Make a conscious effort to diversify your social media feed and the news sources you consume. Expose yourself to different viewpoints and experiences.\n\nAnother thing you could try is challenging your own thoughts when they arise. When you catch yourself thinking something racist, ask yourself: \"Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? Is there another way to interpret this situation?\" It's like training a muscle \u2013 the more you challenge those thoughts, the weaker they become.\n\nIt's also worth considering *why* you might be having these thoughts. Are you feeling insecure or threatened in some way? Sometimes, biases are a way of trying to feel superior or protect ourselves. Understanding the root cause can help you address the issue more effectively.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. This isn't going to change overnight. It's a process of unlearning and relearning. Acknowledge your progress, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. Keep at it, and you'll gradually start to see a shift in your thinking. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to start treating these thoughts like any other unhelpful habit you\u2019re trying to break. When you notice yourself making a sweeping judgment, take a quick mental pause and remind yourself that it\u2019s just a reflex, not a fact. Over time, that pause gets easier and longer. You can also commit to reading or watching content that highlights positive, everyday experiences of people from groups you tend to generalize. This naturally broadens your perspective and makes it harder for those stereotypes to stick. Avoid trying to flip a switch overnight \u2014 instead, think of this process as building a small, consistent practice of challenging your assumptions every time they come up. Gradual repetition and correction really do help reshape your mindset in the long run.",

Getting back on track with discipline can be challenging, but it's definitely doable. Since you're learning to play the guitar, try setting small, achievable goals to rebuild your routine. Start with just 10-15 minutes of practice each day. Consistency is key, and even short sessions can make a big difference over time. Also, try to connect with other guitar learners or join a community online. Sharing progress and challenges with others can be really motivating. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs\u2014what matters is getting back up and keeping at it. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Learning guitar is a great goal, and it's completely normal for discipline to fluctuate - what matters is that you're ready to rebuild it. Start small by committing to just 10 minutes of practice each day at the same time, perhaps right after breakfast or before bed. The key is consistency over intensity. Once those 10 minutes become automatic (usually takes about 2-3 weeks), gradually increase the duration.\n\nSet up your practice space so your guitar is easily visible and accessible - having to dig it out of a closet creates unnecessary friction. Track your practice sessions in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar or using a habit tracking app. This gives you a visual reminder of your progress and helps maintain momentum.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. If you miss a day, just pick up again the next day without beating yourself up. Focus on the process rather than results, and celebrate small wins like learning a new chord or completing your daily practice, no matter how brief.\n\nWhat specific aspect of guitar playing interests you most?

I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:\n\n1. Assess my current situation\n2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self\n3. Create SMART goals \n4. Do a daily review of the day\n\n**Assess the situation**.  \nThis is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  \nI started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  \nInfrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  \nThen i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  \nAfter that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\n\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.\n\n**Map out your ideal self**  \nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SMART Goals**  \nWay to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  \nRelevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   \n\n\n**Daily Review**  \nThe hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  \n\n\nSo these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

Since you mentioned wanting better career prospects, that could be a good focus.\n\nYour art history degree isn't a failure - it shows you can complete complex academic work.

On top of that, I\u2019ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I\u2019m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn\u2019t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn\u2019t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I\u2019m never sure of my next move, I\u2019m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don\u2019t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is enough or if I\u2019m cutting myself short.

Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I\u2019d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I\u2019m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I\u2019m so far behind in life and it\u2019s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don\u2019t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn\u2019t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don\u2019t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn\u2019t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn\u2019t the most motivated person either, so that\u2019s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can\u2019t continue to operate in that same perspective. I\u2019m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I\u2019m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can\u2019t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss\u2014that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, congrats on the 100lb weight loss - that's a massive achievement that shows you're capable of significant change when you put your mind to it. Don't downplay it, even if the method wasn't perfect. You've already proven you can transform yourself.\n\nThe gaming and escapism make total sense given your background. But now you're ready to level up in the real world, and that's going to take breaking things down into smaller, manageable quests rather than trying to solve everything at once.\n\nStart with creating a basic daily structure. Pick 3-4 fixed times each day for essential activities like waking up, eating meals, and going to bed. Stick to these times religiously for 2-3 weeks until they become automatic. This will help ground you in the present moment and give your days some scaffolding to build on.\n\nFor career direction, instead of trying to find your passion immediately, focus on building general workplace skills through any steady job. The goal right now isn't finding your dream career - it's developing consistency, responsibility, and basic professional capabilities. These transfer to any field you eventually choose.\n\nTo improve focus and presence, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes and do just ONE thing during that time. Could be reading, cleaning, job searching, whatever. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back to the task. Start with 20 minutes once per day, then gradually increase. This builds your \"attention muscle\" over time.\n\nYou're not as far behind as you think. Many people reset their lives in their 30s and 40s. The key is to stop comparing yourself to others and focus on taking small, consistent steps forward. You've already shown you can make major changes - now it's about applying that same determination to building the life you want, one day at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to share your story and acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve. First, let's give you credit for recognizing your patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. It's also great that you've made progress in some areas, like losing 100lbs, which shows you're capable of achieving your goals when you set your mind to it.\n\nTo start building discipline and structure, I'd recommend starting small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, focus on creating a daily routine that includes time blocks for self-care, learning, and productivity. You can begin by setting aside 30 minutes each morning for journaling or meditation to help clear your mind and set intentions for the day.\n\nSince you mentioned struggling with scatter-brained thoughts and memory recall, consider using a planner or app to stay organized and keep track of your tasks and goals. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks can also help you build momentum and confidence.\n\nTo become more present and aware of your surroundings, try incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as taking short walks or doing a few minutes of deep breathing exercises. You can also practice active listening by focusing on the person speaking to you, maintaining eye contact, and asking open-ended questions to encourage meaningful conversations.\n\nRemember that personal growth is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - celebrate your small wins, and use them as motivation to keep moving forward. You've got this, and it's never too late to make a positive change in your life.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're even writing this post shows you're ready to make a change, and that's huge. You've already lost 100lbs, even if you feel conflicted about how you did it, that's still a massive accomplishment. Give yourself some credit for that!\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed when you feel behind, so let's break it down. Forget about comparing yourself to your friends. Everyone's on their own timeline. Focus on small, consistent steps.\n\nSince you're struggling with structure, start with ONE thing. Maybe it's waking up at the same time every day, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill on Khan Academy. Just one thing, and build from there. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight.\n\nAbout the memory issues and losing perspective, try journaling. Write down those insights as soon as you have them. Even just a few sentences can help you remember and revisit those ideas later.\n\nTo be more present, try mindfulness exercises. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through short meditations. Even just 5 minutes a day can make a difference. When you find your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath or your surroundings.\n\nAs for finding a career path, don't put so much pressure on yourself to find the \"perfect\" thing right away. Experiment! Try volunteering, taking online courses, or shadowing someone in a field you're curious about. The goal is to explore and learn, not to find the ultimate answer immediately.\n\nYou've got this. It's a journey, not a race. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward.\n",
    "comment_o1":"It helps to start small and build momentum. Try waking up at the same time each day and planning one thing you want to accomplish, whether it\u2019s going for a walk or reading for half an hour. Once you\u2019ve shown yourself you can stick to one habit, add another. Over time, this layering creates real progress. Consider also giving yourself purposeful breaks from gaming\u2014schedule limited sessions and fill the rest of your day with activities that push you forward. Pick something you\u2019re curious about (like coding, carpentry, cooking, or anything that sparks even a bit of enthusiasm) and dig into it. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lifelong passion to be worth exploring; you\u2019ll gain skills and confidence just by practicing something steadily. Journaling can be useful too\u2014jot down what you did each day, what went well, and what you\u2019d like to focus on tomorrow. Doing that helps you become more present and aware of your decisions. If you find yourself spinning too much in your head, a professional counselor or therapist could offer guidance, but don\u2019t underestimate the power of consistent, small actions in changing your habits and mindset. You\u2019ve already shown you can achieve big goals; keep building on that.",

    "post_body":"I work a corporate 9 - 5 job, but because of covid and WFH, it's been more of a 9 - 9 kinda deal. I'll not get too much into it but I'm miserable during the weekdays. I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - \n\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \n\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\n\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring\/fun it is going to be?",
    "comment_best_human":"I personally don't think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\n\nI can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference",
    "comment_10th_human":"You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby\/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're looking to make a change. Here are a few ideas that might help you find more balance and enjoyment in your weekdays:\n\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each day. This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.\n\n3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there's a way to manage it better. It's important to have time for yourself outside of work.\n\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.\n\n5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor.

You're taking a positive step by seeking advice, and that's a great start!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, working 12-hour days while WFH isn't sustainable - no wonder you're living for the weekends. This isn't what the next 35-40 years needs to look like, and there are several ways to make positive changes.\n\nStart by setting firm boundaries at work. Block your calendar for breaks, log off at a consistent time, and communicate your availability clearly to colleagues. Your mental health and performance will both improve with better work-life balance.\n\nInstead of viewing weekdays as something to \"get through,\" try building small things to look forward to throughout the week. Maybe it's a Monday evening hobby class, Wednesday lunch with a friend, or Thursday morning workout. These anchor points make weekdays more meaningful and break up the monotony.\n\nFor the food and sleep issues - they're connected to your current lifestyle. When we're stressed and unfulfilled during the week, we tend to seek comfort in food and sleep. Rather than fighting your body to get up, try going to bed earlier and establishing a proper morning routine. Even 15 minutes of morning activity (stretching, brief walk, reading) can shift your mindset for the day ahead.\n\nConsider finding a physical activity you enjoy and scheduling it 2-3 times during the week. Exercise helps regulate mood, sleep, and eating patterns, plus gives you something productive to focus on besides work.\n\nThe goal isn't to make weekdays as exciting as weekends, but to create a sustainable rhythm where each day has its own value. Start with one small change this week - whether that's setting a work boundary, adding a weekday activity, or establishing a morning routine. Build from there gradually.\n\nRemember that feeling stuck isn't the same as being stuck. You have more control over your daily experience than it might feel like right now.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in a cycle of just trying to survive the weekdays and then overdoing it on the weekends. First, I want to acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. One thing that might help is to try to find small things to look forward to during the week, even if it's just something as simple as a favorite lunch or a short walk outside during your break. This can help break up the monotony of the weekdays and give you something to focus on besides just counting down to Friday. \n\nIt might also be helpful to set some boundaries around your work hours, since you mentioned you're working 9-9 and feeling overwhelmed. Could you try setting a specific \"shutdown\" time for work each day, and then do something you enjoy in the evening to signal to yourself that work is over? This could be reading, drawing, or anything else that helps you relax and feel like you're not still \"on the clock\".\n\nIn terms of respecting each day equally, it might be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than always looking ahead to the weekend. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can help with this. It's also worth considering what specific things are making your weekdays feel so boring or unfulfilling - is it the work itself, the lack of social interaction, something else? Once you identify what's missing, you might be able to find ways to address those needs and make the weekdays more enjoyable.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're aware of how your current habits are affecting your mental and physical health. Have you considered seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of these issues? They might be able to provide additional guidance and support as you try to make these changes.

    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I hear you. That \"living for the weekend\" cycle can be brutal, especially when work is draining. It sounds like you're stuck in a rut, but definitely not an unfixable one.\n\nFirst, about accepting the next 35-40 years... don't! That's a recipe for misery. Instead of thinking of it as one long, monotonous stretch, break it down. What small, achievable goals can you set for the next month, the next quarter, the next year? These don't have to be huge career leaps, but things that add meaning and enjoyment to your life *outside* of work. Maybe it's learning a new skill, exploring a hobby, or volunteering.\n\nSecond, tackle the weekday misery. Since you're WFH, can you carve out specific \"work hours\" and stick to them? Even if it means shutting down your computer at 5 or 6 pm, even if you haven't finished everything. It's about setting boundaries. Also, try to incorporate small joys into your weekdays. A walk during lunch, listening to a podcast while you work, or even just making a really good cup of coffee.\n\nThird, address the food coping mechanism. This is tough, but awareness is the first step. Instead of reaching for food when you're stressed or sad, try to identify the trigger and find a healthier alternative. Maybe it's calling a friend, doing some light exercise, or practicing mindfulness. Start small, like replacing one unhealthy snack a day with something better.\n\nFinally, the sleep inertia. Instead of just lying there, try to get some sunlight as soon as you wake up. Open the blinds, go for a short walk, or even just sit by a window. The light helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\nIt's all about small, consistent changes. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight.

It also helps to reduce the \u201cweekend is everything\u201d mentality because you\u2019re sprinkling little pockets of satisfaction throughout the week. As for struggling with getting out of bed and using food as a comfort, try focusing on simple, consistent steps: go to bed around the same time, wake up around the same time, and aim for meals you actually enjoy but that don\u2019t keep you feeling sluggish. Even just a short walk or 10 minutes of a favorite hobby before work can shift your mindset over time.

    "post_body":"For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I'd legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I've done just that before.\n\nI realize it will ultimately come to \"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\" which is fine. But ideally I'd like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?",
    "comment_best_human":"Here\u2019s the thing - it\u2019s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that\u2019s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there\u2019s also freeze, and that\u2019s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your \u201clizard brain\u201d reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I\u2019m an idiot, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here\u2019s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it\u2019s up to you) I\u2019m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you\u2019re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it\u2019s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically\u2026 but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes\/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you\u2019ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that\u2019s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like \u201cthank god it\u2019s over\u201d or \u201cI can keep going\u201d. If you say \u201cthank god, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you\u2019re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

    "comment_gpt4":"I totally get where you're coming from. Tackling unpleasant tasks can feel like a huge mental hurdle. One trick that might help is the \"5-minute rule.\" Tell yourself you'll only work on the task for 5 minutes. Often, just starting is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it's easier to keep going. Also, try to pair the task with something you enjoy, like listening to your favorite music or podcast. This can make the activity feel less daunting. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset and reduce that pull toward inaction. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"That pull toward inaction is super common - your brain is trying to avoid what it perceives as unpleasant work. The good news is you can gradually rewire this response through a few practical approaches.\n\nFirst, try breaking tasks into ridiculously small chunks. Instead of \"clean room,\" make it \"put away one item\" or \"clear this one corner of the desk.\" Your brain has less resistance to tiny actions, and once you start, momentum often carries you further.\n\nSecond, use implementation intentions: \"When X happens, I will do Y.\" For example, \"When I finish my morning coffee, I will put away 3 items.\" This bypasses the decision-making process where resistance typically creeps in.\n\nA technique that's helped many people is the \"5-4-3-2-1\" method. Count down from 5, and when you hit 1, immediately take physical action - stand up, grab that first item, whatever gets you moving. It short-circuits the overthinking that leads to inaction.\n\nThe key isn't fighting the resistance - that just creates more mental friction. Instead, make the first step so small it feels almost silly to resist it. Over time, as you build positive associations with taking action, that pull toward inaction naturally weakens.\n\nStart with just 2 minutes of action at scheduled times. The consistency matters more than duration at first. You're essentially teaching your brain that these tasks aren't actually threatening, and the resistance will gradually fade.",
    "comment_llama":"I think what you're experiencing is pretty common, and it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to address it. One strategy that might help is to try to understand what's driving your aversion to these tasks - is it the physical effort, the mental overwhelm, or something else? Once you have a better sense of what's behind your resistance, you can start to break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces, and find ways to make it less painful. For example, instead of thinking \"I need to clean my entire room,\" try telling yourself \"I'll just put away these 5 items on my desk.\" It's a small win, but it can get you moving. Additionally, you might consider implementing a \"2-minute rule\" - when you feel the urge to procrastinate, commit to working on the task for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and you'll find you can keep going after those initial 2 minutes are up. As for eliminating the pull toward doing nothing, it's unlikely you'll be able to completely eliminate it, but by building discipline and developing strategies to overcome your resistance, you can make it easier to choose action over inaction.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is actively fighting you!

Often, once you've done that one tiny thing, you'll find it easier to do another, and another.\n\nAnother trick is to pair the unpleasant task with something you *enjoy*. Listen to your favorite podcast while you organize, or promise yourself a small treat (like a piece of chocolate or 5 minutes of browsing Reddit) after 15 minutes of cleaning.\n\nFinally, consider *why* you're avoiding the task.

    "post_body":"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work. The first two days I did will and actually worked for 4 hours. But by Wednesday i couldn\u2019t even get myself to work more than an hour. I spent so much energy forcing myself to work that day and I couldn\u2019t do it. Almost like I was constipated mentally.\n\nShould I lower down the work hours (even tho 3 is so small). And try to gradually increase the minimum time working? Or is it because I just don\u2019t care enough about this business I\u2019m working on. I\u2019m amazed how people can work 6 hours a day of pure focused work. Sometimes I think there\u2019s something wrong with me.\n\nWhen it comes to gym, eating healthy I can see those benefits immediately right after and feel good. But with work I feel like shit after and I don\u2019t really care about making bank. I do feel good sometimes but for the most part its a chore that makes me dislike life more.\n\nThank you!",
    "comment_best_human":"Look up Atomic Habits. The real goal right now is to just convince yourself to show up to your work setting and not worry about how long. Maybe a few times a day to return. Maybe you get some in, maybe not. But good chance while you're at it without the pressure you will.\n\nNext make it fun, find something to reward yourself ONLY when you do some work. That's it. The only time. Associate it with doing the Thing (work) and you'll enjoy work a bit more knowing what you get out of the deal",
    "comment_10th_human":"Start so small that you laugh at it, do it for a week, increase by 10min, do it for a week, rinse & repeat until you\u2019re at your goal of 3h. It\u2019ll take longer but it\u2019ll be a habit.\n\nYou can also look up the pomodoro technique, think of ways to make it fun (reward yourself etc but not every time), have a deal made with someone that you pay them \u00a3xx.xx or donate to something you dislike if you miss 2 days in a row or 2 days from the same week. We can work a lot better with a drive to do it (the fun part) and a drive to not miss it (the punishment of losing money\/whatever you decide).\n\nTry to make sure you enjoy the work you\u2019re doing too if you\u2019re lucky enough to be in that situation, definitely helps a whole lot!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention finding out \u2018Why\u2019 you\u2019re doing this work, what drives you? Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you\u2019re having a bad day and ask yourself \u201cwhat the f am I doing this?\u201d Your brain replies with the answer and continue.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're really trying to find a balance that works for you, and that's a great start. First off, don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to have fluctuations in motivation and energy. If 3 hours feels overwhelming right now, it's totally okay to scale back a bit. Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. \n\nAlso, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one. It might also help to set specific goals for each session, so you have a clear purpose and can see progress over time.\n\nSince you mentioned that you don't feel the same immediate benefits from work as you do from the gym or eating healthy, try to find ways to make your work more rewarding. Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.\n\nLastly, it's worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn't, it might be why you're struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Starting with 3 hours and dropping to 1 isn't unusual at all - this happens to most people when building new work habits. The mental resistance you're experiencing is totally normal, especially since you mentioned not feeling particularly passionate about the business side of things.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: Start with just 25 minutes of focused work (one Pomodoro), followed by a 5-minute break. Do this twice a day at first. It's ridiculously easy, but that's the point - you want to build consistency before duration. Once this becomes effortless (probably after a week or two), add another session. Keep building gradually.\n\nThe gym analogy you made is really interesting - you're motivated there because you get immediate positive feedback. We can use this! Try breaking your work into smaller chunks where you can feel that same sense of completion. Set tiny goals that you can \"check off\" every 25 minutes, giving yourself that same hit of accomplishment you get from the gym.\n\nAlso, consider examining what type of work actually energizes you versus drains you. If the business itself feels like a constant drain, it might be worth exploring what aspects of work do give you that \"feel good\" sensation, even if it's just small parts of your current projects.\n\nRemember, those people working focused for 6 hours didn't start there - they built up to it. There's nothing wrong with you; you're just at the beginning of building this particular muscle. Start small, be consistent, and gradually level up.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling to find motivation and consistency with your work schedule, and that's totally normal. One approach you might consider is indeed starting smaller and gradually increasing your daily work time. Instead of aiming for 3 hours right off the bat, try committing to a manageable 30 minutes or 1 hour of focused work each day, and then gradually add more time as you build the habit. This can help make the task less daunting and allow you to develop a sense of momentum.\n\nIt's also worth exploring why you feel so differently about work compared to other activities like going to the gym or eating healthy. You mention that with those activities, you can see the benefits immediately and feel good afterwards. With work, it might be helpful to try to identify some more immediate rewards or benefits, even if they're not directly related to making money. For example, do you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing a task? Do you enjoy the process of learning new skills or solving problems?\n\nAs for whether you care enough about your business, that's a tough question to answer, but it might be worth reflecting on what specifically is driving your lack of motivation. Is it the type of work itself, or is it something else entirely? Are there ways you could make your work more engaging or meaningful to you? Remember that it's okay if your motivations and interests evolve over time, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it's totally normal to struggle with consistency, especially when you're first starting out. Don't beat yourself up about it!\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing burnout, which is common when you push too hard too fast. Lowering your work hours and gradually increasing them is a solid strategy. Think of it like building a muscle \u2013 you wouldn't start with the heaviest weight. Maybe start with 1-2 hours and add 15 minutes each day or every few days.\n\nAlso, the fact that you enjoy the gym and healthy eating more suggests you value the immediate feedback. Work often lacks that instant gratification. Try breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable tasks with clear, achievable goals. Completing those smaller tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum.\n\nFinally, it's worth exploring *why* you're working on this business. If you don't care about the outcome, it's going to be a constant uphill battle. Can you connect your work to something you *do* care about, even if it's indirectly? Or maybe this business isn't the right fit, and that's okay too. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"You might start by scaling back a bit and then gradually working your way up. Even if three hours feels \u201csmall,\u201d it\u2019s better to lock in a consistent habit than to overextend and burn out. Sometimes breaking work into bite-sized chunks (like 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off) makes it more manageable. If you\u2019re unsure whether you truly care about the business, try finding a short-term goal or small achievement you can get excited about, so you have a clear reason to sit down and work. Discipline often grows from taking these little wins and turning them into a routine, rather than trying to force yourself through hours of work you resent. It may not feel as instantly rewarding as hitting the gym, but getting in a rhythm of consistent effort can still bring a sense of accomplishment once those small victories add up.",

    "post_body":"Hi guys,\nI\u2019m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It\u2019s bad because i\u2019ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I\u2019ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it\u2019s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can\u2019t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can\u2019t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don\u2019t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)",
    "comment_best_human":"Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. \n\nOne thing I will say is that it\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It\u2019s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to be ok, and it does get better. \n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can\u2019t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.",
    "comment_10th_human":"Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. \n\nI\u2019m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that\u2019s making you feel bad. But it\u2019s a good place to start when trying to get on track. \n\nProtect your sleep. Do that by:\n\n- Going to bed at the same time every night. \n- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you\u2019re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don\u2019t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you\u2019ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \n\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking such proactive steps with your program and recognizing the need for change. That's a huge first step. When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. \n\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. \n\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through. \n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. The important thing is to not let a slip turn into a fall. Be kind to yourself and focus on getting back on track the next day. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, props for taking action by enrolling in that program and sticking with it for a month - that's already a huge win. Your 4-item daily list sounds really solid and manageable too.\n\nFor staying consistent while dealing with mental health challenges, I've found that treating slip-ups differently made a massive difference. Instead of viewing a missed day as a total reset, think of it like missing a meal - you wouldn't stop eating entirely just because you missed lunch, right? You'd just eat your next meal.\n\nA few practical tools that might help:\n\nThe \"Streaks\" app is great for tracking daily habits and gives you a visual of your progress. Having that reminder and seeing your streak build up can be really motivating.\n\nFor accountability, check out the Discord server for this subreddit (in the sidebar). There are channels specifically for daily check-ins and support. Having people to report to daily makes a big difference.\n\nOne technique that's helped me push through tough mental health days is the \"5-minute rule\" - commit to just 5 minutes of an activity. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you start, but if not, you still succeeded by doing those 5 minutes.\n\nStart tomorrow, but remember: progress isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that's completely normal. What matters is picking back up and continuing forward, even if it's just with those 5 minutes.",
    "comment_llama":"It's great that you've recognized the pattern of slipping back into depression and isolation, and you're taking proactive steps to change it. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Since you have a list of 4 things you want to do daily, try to create an environment that supports those habits. For example, lay out your workout clothes the night before, or put a reminder on your phone to meditate at the same time every day. \n\nIt's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have off days. Instead of beating yourself up over slipping up, try to learn from it and get back on track as soon as possible. You might find it helpful to track your progress in a journal or use an app like Habitica or HabitBull to monitor your habits and stay accountable.\n\nAdditionally, having a support system in place can make a huge difference. Since you're already in a therapy program, you might want to discuss your struggles with your therapist and see if they can offer any additional guidance or support. You could also consider joining online communities or forums for people with social anxiety disorder, where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and wanting to change, so try to focus on the small wins and celebrate your successes along the way. Good luck starting tomorrow, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support or guidance!",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it's awesome you're taking such proactive steps! It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when tackling social anxiety, especially with the risk of slipping into depression.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is focusing on *progress, not perfection*. You mentioned that slipping once feels like a huge setback. Instead of viewing it that way, try to see it as a data point. If you miss a day, ask yourself *why*. Was the goal too ambitious? Were you too tired? Then adjust accordingly. Maybe break down your \"one social thing\" into even smaller, more manageable steps. Like, day 1: just walk to the store. Day 2: walk in and browse for 2 minutes. Day 3: ask an employee a question.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot. Celebrate the small wins. Did you meditate for 5 minutes instead of 10? Great! You still meditated.\n\nFor accountability, have you considered finding an online support group specifically for social anxiety? Sharing your experiences and challenges with others who understand can be incredibly validating and motivating. There are also habit tracking apps like Streaks or Habitica that can gamify the process and make it more engaging.\n\nFinally, remember that therapy is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be ups and downs. The important thing is to keep showing up for yourself. You got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve found that focusing on tiny, consistent steps each day makes a huge difference. It sounds like you have a solid plan with your program, meditation, workouts, and a simple social goal. A big key is treating a \u201cslip\u201d as part of the process rather than a reason to give up. Even if you miss a day, just pick up where you left off without beating yourself up. Having a tracking app can help you see real progress and give you little hits of motivation\u2014Habitica turns goals into a game, and there are others like Strides or Loop if you prefer something simpler. Some folks also like having an accountability partner or posting updates in supportive subreddits for that extra push. Before bed, try writing down one small objective for each of your four tasks the next day, so you wake up with a concrete plan. Over time, the small wins pile up, and the fear that one misstep dooms you will start to fade. Good luck\u2014you\u2019ve got this.",

For example, your interest in physical sciences could merge with your content creation ideas - there's a huge demand for engaging science communication. Your background in psychology and economics adds valuable perspective for breaking down complex topics for others.\n\nInstead of trying to find one perfect passion, try running small experiments. Pick something that interests you (like those science topics) and commit to a 30-day project. Could be writing daily posts, making short videos, or diving into research. The key is to set concrete goals and actually complete the experiment before judging if it's right for you.\n\nYour values around honesty and desire for broader impact are great anchors. Rather than waiting to feel completely ready for something like YouTube content, start with a minimal viable version. Post once a week about a topic you're genuinely curious about, see how it feels, adjust based on feedback.\n\nRemember that passion often follows competence - the more you develop skills in an area, the more engaging it becomes.

Could you take an online course or read some books to see if that feeling is still there? Even if it doesn't become a career, it could be a fulfilling hobby.\n\nAlso, you mentioned self-help videos. That aligns with your interest in helping people and your problem-solving skills. Instead of just sitting on the idea, maybe start small. Write down a few topics you're passionate about and outline a potential video. Even just the act of planning might give you more clarity.\n\nThe key is to experiment and not put too much pressure on yourself to find the \"perfect\" thing right away. Try to focus on small, actionable steps. Maybe dedicate 30 minutes a day to exploring one of these potential paths. Over time, you'll start to see which ones resonate and which ones don't. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"You might try breaking down each interest by giving yourself a specific mini-goal over a few weeks, like writing a short blog on a psychology concept or tackling a simple experiment in the physical sciences to see if you still find it worthwhile once it\u2019s more hands-on. Even if you feel uncertain, set a regular schedule and commit to brief daily or weekly consistency so you build momentum and see what sticks. Sometimes passion grows after you push through the early awkward stages, especially if it aligns with your values and the impact you want to have. If you focus on small, measurable efforts, you\u2019ll learn which activities energize you and which feel like a chore. Gradually ramp up whichever area keeps you coming back, and stay open to new experiences along the way\u2014often you won\u2019t realize you\u2019re passionate about something until you\u2019re in the thick of it.",

    "comment_best_human":"Hey, congratulations for expressing yourself, you can be proud of you. That's not an easy thing to do. In my opinion, you lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. Only you can know why and how to improve it. You'll find what's best for you. To know what's best, you have to compare, in order to compare, you have to try different things. Pick what works for you, leave what doesn't. \n\nBut remember that you become what you do, only actions are effective. And if you feel like not having the will power to try something you have never tried, it's either you evolve trying, or you remain the same.

    "comment_10th_human":"I feel like getting to the heart of your sleep problems will help a lot with almost everything else on this list? Like if you can, find some way to access a sleep specialist, spend some money on it if you can, really try to get a decent sleep schedule. Try everything you can, this matters a lot. \n\nSleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won't magically fix everything, but I feel like it's a good first step.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice\u2014acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\n\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels\u2014there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\n\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\n\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\n\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It\u2019s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\n\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many successful people deal with similar challenges behind closed doors. The good news is you've already taken two huge steps: getting diagnosed with ADHD and recognizing these issues need addressing.\n\nLet's start small. When everything feels overwhelming, trying to fix everything at once usually backfires. Pick ONE thing to focus on first - I'd suggest your sleep schedule since that affects everything else. Start by setting a firm \"screens off\" time 1-2 hours before your target bedtime. Even if you can't sleep, just lie there in the dark. Your body needs to relearn proper sleep patterns.\n\nFor the immediate term, tackle your bedroom. A chaotic environment makes everything harder, especially with ADHD. Set a timer for just 20 minutes and clean what you can. Tomorrow, another 20 minutes. Don't try to perfect it - just make it livable.\n\nRegarding your law degree - you're so close. Instead of thinking about the whole six months, break it into tiny chunks. Study for just 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), then take a break. Even one Pomodoro per day is better than nothing. Build from there.\n\nFor work and motivation - external accountability helps tremendously with ADHD. Could you find a study buddy for law school? Or ask your boss for more frequent check-ins on projects? Sometimes just having to report progress to someone else can provide that extra push.\n\nKeep working with your doctor on the ADHD meds. Finding the right medication and dosage often takes time and experimentation. While you're figuring that out, focus on building small, sustainable habits rather than relying on motivation.\n\nYou haven't fooled anyone - imposter syndrome is real, but the fact that others see you as competent suggests you're more capable than you give yourself credit for. Take it one day at a time, one small win at a time. You've got this.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of challenges that are all interconnected, which can be really overwhelming. One thing that might help is to focus on building small habits and routines that can help you gain momentum and confidence. For example, instead of trying to tackle your entire law degree at once, try setting a goal to study for just 15-20 minutes each day. That way, you can build up your endurance and make progress without feeling overwhelmed. \n\nSimilarly, with your energy levels and sleep issues, it might be helpful to establish a consistent bedtime routine and try to create a relaxing sleep environment. And with your motivation and productivity, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can help make them feel less daunting.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in feeling like you're \"fooling\" people or that you don't understand things as well as you think you should. A lot of people struggle with imposter syndrome, and it's okay to ask for help and admit when you don't know something.\n\nIn terms of getting your apartment and finances organized, it might be helpful to start with small steps, like setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to tidy up or work on a budget. And don't be afraid to reach out to a financial advisor or therapist for support - they can provide you with personalized guidance and help you develop strategies to manage your debt and anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to have everything figured out right now, and it's great that you're taking the first step by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep in mind that building discipline and changing habits takes time, so be patient with yourself and try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect.",
    "comment_gemini":"Okay, so you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's totally understandable given everything you've listed. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Let's break this down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, tackle the physical stuff. Your health and environment are foundational. Since you're already eating healthy but not losing weight, maybe get a check-up with your doctor to rule out any underlying issues, especially given the fatigue and sleep problems. Addressing the sleep is crucial. Try setting a strict bedtime routine \u2013 even if you don't fall asleep right away, dim the lights, avoid screens, and try some relaxation techniques. Consistency is key here. As for the apartment, don't try to clean everything at once. Pick *one* small area, like your bedside table, and focus only on that. Once that's done, move on to the next small area. Small wins build momentum.\n\nNext, let's look at the law degree. Six months is a relatively short time. Can you break down your remaining coursework into tiny, achievable tasks? Instead of \"study law,\" think \"read one page of my textbook\" or \"review my notes for 15 minutes.\" Set a timer and commit to just that small amount of time. You might find that once you get started, you can keep going. If not, that's okay too. You still accomplished something.\n\nFor the job, talk to your manager. Explain that you're working on improving your time management and ask for specific feedback on deadlines. Sometimes just having a clear understanding of expectations can reduce anxiety.\n\nFinally, regarding feeling \"dumb,\" remember that everyone has imposter syndrome sometimes. Focus on your strengths and what you *do* know. Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to where you were yesterday.\n\nThe key here is to start small, be consistent, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it seems. You've got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to pick just one thing you can tackle first\u2014like your sleep schedule or cleaning your bedroom\u2014and focus on making consistent, small changes. For example, set an alarm for a reasonable bedtime and power down electronics half an hour before bed. If that\u2019s too big a leap, start moving your bedtime just 10 or 15 minutes earlier each night. Once you see progress in that one area, you\u2019ll build confidence to tackle something else, like setting a short, focused block of study time every day or chipping away at the mess in your room for a set period of time. It\u2019s less about willpower and more about building routines that get you to act without overthinking. If you\u2019re still feeling stuck with ADHD despite medication, keep talking to your doctor or consider trying different tools (timers, reminders, accountability buddies). You\u2019re closer to crossing that finish line than you might think, and small, consistent steps often do more than big bursts of motivation.",

So my ideal routine would include 2 meal prep  per week. \n\n\nI finished work this evening and I\u2019m exhausted.  And not just physically, it\u2019s just my eyes are tired from looking at a screen all day long. When my eyes feel tired, i know I\u2019m out for the day.  If I\u2019m just physically tired, i can still push through.\nI\u2019ve decided to stop ordering takeouts and eating healthier (to help with energy).

    "comment_gpt4":"I totally get where you're coming from\u2014after a long day, the last thing you want to do is cook. Here are a few ideas that might help: \n\n1. **Simplify Your Meals**: Focus on recipes that are quick and easy but still healthy. Think stir-fries, salads, or one-pot meals that take 20-30 minutes max. \n\n2. **Batch Prep Ingredients**: Instead of full meals, prep ingredients twice a week. Chop veggies, marinate proteins, or cook grains in advance. This way, you can mix and match to create fresh meals quickly.\n\n3. **Use a Slow Cooker or Instant Pot**: These can be lifesavers. You can throw everything in before work and come home to a ready meal. Plus, they often make enough for leftovers that don\u2019t feel stale.\n\n4. **Set a Routine**: Try to set a specific time for cooking, like right after work. It might be tough at first, but once it becomes a habit, it\u2019ll feel less like a chore.\n\n5. **Incorporate Breaks**: If screen fatigue is a big issue, take short breaks during the day to rest your eyes. This might help you feel less drained by the evening.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works for you and making small adjustments. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Here's what's worked really well for me with weekday cooking: start super simple and gradually build up. Instead of jumping straight into complex meal prep, focus on quick, nutritious meals that take 15-20 minutes max.\n\nSome game-changers: keep pre-chopped vegetables in the fridge (way easier than meal prep, still fresh), and always have eggs, canned beans, and quick-cooking proteins on hand. A simple stir-fry with pre-cut veggies and chicken takes barely any time. Sheet pan dinners are also great - just toss everything on a pan and let the oven do the work while you rest your eyes.\n\nFor the screen fatigue, try the 20-20-20 rule during work: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It makes a huge difference in evening energy levels.\n\nThe key is making cooking as effortless as possible when you're tired. Start with just 2-3 really simple recipes you can make on autopilot. Once those become habit, you can expand your repertoire. Remember, a basic homemade meal is still way better than takeout, so don't feel pressure to make anything fancy.\n\nAlso, consider doing the bare minimum prep (like washing vegetables or marinating meat) in the morning when you're fresher. Even 5 minutes of morning prep makes evening cooking much more manageable.",
    "comment_llama":"I totally get where you're coming from - it can be tough to muster up the energy to cook after a long day of staring at screens. One thing that's helped me is to keep my weekday meals super simple, like one-pot wonders or stir-fries that can be whipped up in 20-30 minutes. That way, I'm not feeling overwhelmed by a complicated recipe when I'm already exhausted. \n\nAnother strategy you might consider is breaking down your cooking into smaller tasks, like chopping veggies or marinating proteins, that you can do at different times of the day when you have a bit more energy. Then, when it's time to cook, it feels less daunting because some of the prep work is already done.\n\nSince you're looking to do two meal preps per week, you might also think about cooking in bulk on those days, but then portioning out individual servings that can be reheated quickly throughout the week. That way, you're not eating \"stale\" food, but you're still getting the benefits of having healthy meals ready to go. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if some nights you just can't cook - it's okay to have a backup plan, like a simple salad or some scrambled eggs, that requires minimal effort but still gets you a nutritious meal. Good luck with your new routine!",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get the weekday cooking struggle after a long day of screen time. It's rough! Here's what's worked for me:\n\nFirst, instead of thinking of it as \"meal prep,\" try \"ingredient prep.\" Chop veggies, cook grains, or marinate proteins on your prep days. That way, during the week, you're just assembling things, not starting from scratch. It feels fresher than fully prepped meals.\n\nSecond, embrace quick & easy recipes. Think stir-fries, sheet pan dinners, or big salads. These can be thrown together in under 30 minutes. Websites like Budget Bytes or Skinnytaste have tons of ideas.\n\nThird, consider your \"eye fatigue\" trigger. Maybe blue light glasses or adjusting your screen brightness could help you feel less drained at the end of the day. Even a short break away from the screen every hour can make a difference. If you can tackle the eye fatigue, you might find you have more energy overall.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. If you slip up and order takeout one night, don't beat yourself up. Just get back on track the next day. It's about progress, not perfection. Good luck!\n",

The simpler your recipes, the less overwhelming it\u2019ll feel on a tired night\u2014one-pot meals, stir-fries, or sheet-pan dinners can all be quick wins. If screen fatigue drains you, maybe set up short breaks during work or limit screen time after hours so your eyes and mind get a rest, letting you recharge enough to handle a quick cooking session.

    "comment_claude":"This is a super common challenge - the initial motivation burst followed by burnout. The key is to shift from relying on motivation to building sustainable habits and systems.\n\nA few things that have worked well for maintaining long-term consistency:\n\nStart smaller than you think you need to. Instead of going all-out for 2-3 weeks, begin with a minimal routine you can definitely stick to (even 15-20 mins). You can always build up gradually.\n\nHave a clear \"if-then\" plan for your morning workouts. The more automatic you make it, the less willpower you need. Lay out clothes the night before, keep your gym bag ready, etc. Make the path of least resistance lead to working out.\n\nAccept that some days will feel \"meh\" and that's totally fine. You don't need to crush every workout. Simply showing up and doing something, even if it's lighter than usual, maintains the habit. Consistency > intensity.\n\nWhen you feel burnout coming, scale back instead of stopping completely. Do shorter workouts or lighter days, but keep the routine. It's much easier to maintain momentum than to start over.\n\nTrack your consistency rather than just results. Use a simple habit tracker or calendar. Seeing your streak can be motivating, and it helps identify patterns in when\/why you tend to fall off.\n\nThe morning workout choice is smart - fewer disruptions and excuses. Just remember that discipline isn't about being perfect, it's about getting back on track quickly when you slip. Keep at it!",
    "comment_llama":"I think I can offer some insight here. It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern - starting strong with motivation, but then hitting a wall and struggling to maintain consistency. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Instead of trying to be \"all-in\" all the time, try to make your workouts a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. \n\nAlso, since you mentioned you prefer early morning workouts, try to make that time as convenient and enjoyable as possible. Lay out your workout clothes the night before, prep your breakfast, and find a playlist or podcast that gets you pumped up. As for avoiding burnout, consider incorporating rest days or active recovery into your routine, like a light yoga session or a walk. This can help your body and mind recharge, making it easier to stick to your workouts in the long run. \n\nLastly, try to focus on progress rather than perfection. It's okay to have off days or weeks, but don't let that derail you completely. Get back on track as soon as you can, and remind yourself why you started working out in the first place. You've already identified what works for you (early morning workouts), now it's just a matter of making it a sustainable habit.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That initial motivation is awesome, but it's a beast to maintain! Here's what's helped me stick with it long-term:\n\nFirst, ditch the \"all-in\" mentality. It's a recipe for burnout. Think sustainable, not spectacular. Instead of aiming for intense workouts every day, try scaling back. Maybe 3 days a week with shorter, less intense sessions. Consistency trumps intensity, especially in the long run.\n\nSecond, build in some flexibility. Life happens. Instead of letting a missed workout derail you for weeks, have a backup plan. Maybe a quick bodyweight circuit at home if you can't make it to the gym, or even just a brisk walk. The goal is to keep the momentum going, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nThird, find something you genuinely enjoy. If you dread your workouts, you're less likely to stick with them. Experiment with different activities until you find something that feels less like a chore and more like something you look forward to.\n\nFinally, track your progress. Seeing how far you've come can be a huge motivator. It doesn't have to be anything fancy \u2013 just a simple log of your workouts. When you feel like giving up, look back at your progress and remind yourself of how much you've already accomplished. Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve found it helps to ease up on the all-or-nothing mindset. If you\u2019re burning out after a couple weeks, try shorter or lower-intensity workouts on certain days so you\u2019re not going 100% every time. Consistency is easier when you have something you can stick to even on the days you\u2019re not feeling your best. It might also help to set a strict but manageable schedule\u2014like never skipping a planned early-morning session, even if you only do a light 20-minute routine. That way, you\u2019re reinforcing the habit itself instead of relying on momentum and energy spikes. And if a few days off turn into more, remind yourself that even a short session gets you back on track better than waiting for the \u201cperfect\u201d time. The key is showing up, however you can.",

It can help boost your energy levels and keep you away from the bed. Building a habit of staying active after lunch might take some time, but consistency is key. Keep experimenting with these changes and see what works best for you!",
    "comment_claude":"This post-lunch sleepiness is actually really common - it's often called the \"post-lunch dip\" and happens due to a natural drop in your body's circadian rhythm combined with digestion taking up energy. The good news is there are several ways to manage this:\n\nFirst, try adjusting what you eat for lunch. Large, carb-heavy meals tend to make this worse. Instead, opt for a balanced lunch with lean protein, vegetables, and complex carbs. Also, watch your portion size - overeating definitely increases that sleepy feeling.\n\nGetting some movement right after lunch can make a huge difference. Even a 10-minute walk outside can help wake you up and boost your energy levels. The natural light exposure helps regulate your circadian rhythm too.\n\nStay hydrated throughout the day, especially around lunchtime. Sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration. Keep a water bottle at your desk and sip regularly.\n\nIf you still feel the need to rest, consider a proper power nap (15-20 minutes max) instead of lying in bed for an hour. Set an alarm and get up when it goes off. This can actually boost your afternoon productivity instead of derailing it.\n\nThe key is breaking the habit of going to your bed. Maybe rearrange your space so you're not working near your bed, or create a designated break area that's not your bedroom. Sometimes just changing your environment can help create new patterns.",
    "comment_llama":"It's pretty common to feel a slump after lunch, and there are a few possible reasons for it. One major contributor could be the natural dip in your body's circadian rhythm, which typically occurs in the early afternoon. Another factor might be the type of food you're eating for lunch - a big meal with lots of carbs or sugar can cause a spike in insulin levels, leading to feelings of lethargy. \n\nTry experimenting with your lunch routine to see if that makes a difference. You could attempt to eat smaller, more balanced meals, and avoid heavy foods that are high in sugar or salt. Additionally, getting some fresh air or taking a short walk after lunch might help increase your energy levels. It's also worth considering your sleep schedule and overall daily routine - are you getting enough sleep at night, and are you staying active throughout the day? Making adjustments to these habits could help reduce your afternoon fatigue. As for strategies to stay awake, you might find it helpful to change your environment after lunch, like moving to a different room or sitting outside, to break the association with your bed.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that afternoon slump. It's super common! A few things could be going on. First, it could be what you're eating for lunch. Big, heavy meals, especially those high in carbs, can cause a blood sugar spike and then a crash, leading to that sleepy feeling. Try experimenting with lighter lunches, maybe focusing on protein and veggies.\n\nAlso, consider your hydration. Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger or tiredness. Drink a glass of water right after lunch and see if that helps.\n\nFinally, even a short burst of activity can make a difference. Instead of heading straight for bed, try a quick 10-15 minute walk after you eat. The fresh air and movement can really help combat that sluggishness. If you absolutely can't resist lying down, set a timer for *exactly* 20 minutes. That's enough for a power nap without getting into a deeper sleep cycle that will leave you feeling groggier. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It\u2019s pretty common to feel a post-lunch slump, especially if your meal is big or packed with carbs, so try experimenting with smaller portions or mixing in more protein and veggies. After eating, force yourself into a quick walk or a standing task instead of heading straight to bed\u2014movement often helps fend off drowsiness. Also, pay attention to nighttime habits: if you aren\u2019t getting solid rest, that fatigue can hit harder after meals. If you consistently find yourself exhausted, it might be worth talking to a professional about possible underlying issues, but generally tweaking meal composition, adding a bit of midday activity, and improving your overall sleep routine can do wonders.",

Since you already work out and handle chores, you've got a good foundation - let's build on that.\n\nFirst, try setting a consistent wake-up time even during vacation. It helps create momentum for the day. Then, consider picking up some skills that'll be useful long-term. Learning to code is completely free online through sites like Codecademy. Since you're into music, maybe try learning an instrument or music production - there are tons of free resources for both.\n\nReading is another solid hobby that can fill time productively. Your local library probably has free ebooks and audiobooks you can access from home. You could also start a creative project - writing, digital art, or even starting a YouTube channel about music reviews.\n\nWant something more active? Look into bodyweight fitness routines to complement your workouts, learn to cook (super useful life skill), or pick up running\/cycling. These are all basically free and can give your days more structure.\n\nThe key is to experiment. Try different things for a week each.

The key is to experiment and find what truly interests you. \n\nIn the meantime, why not set a few small goals for yourself each day? This could be as simple as reading a chapter in a book, taking a walk outside, or trying a new recipe. Having something to look forward to can make getting out of bed more exciting. You might also consider setting a consistent wake-up time and creating a morning routine that works for you - this can help give your days some structure even without a traditional schedule.

Beyond that, I agree strongly with some of the other commenters - start working on 1 thing at a time. See how it goes doing it consistently for, say, 6 months. At that point, you can do it more or less and\/or add a new thing to try and do consistently. \n\nAlso stick with the things you\u2019re already doing if you like them, or scale back on those to make more time for yourself if you feel you could better invest your time elsewhere",
    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you have a lot of passions, which is awesome, but it can definitely feel overwhelming. One approach is to prioritize and rotate your interests.

This way, you\u2019re not trying to do everything at once, and you can give each interest the attention it deserves. \n\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for each interest. Instead of aiming to become fluent in French immediately, set a goal to practice for 15 minutes a day. This makes it more manageable and less daunting. \n\nLastly, try to schedule your time. If you have 3-4 hours in the evening, allocate specific time slots for your activities. This can help prevent option paralysis and ensure you\u2019re making progress. Remember, it\u2019s okay to have downtime too\u2014balance is key. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Your situation is really common - having lots of interests is great, but it can definitely lead to decision paralysis. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:\n\nFirst, accept that you can't do everything at once. Instead of trying to juggle all your interests simultaneously, try breaking your year into quarters and focusing deeply on just 1-2 interests per quarter. For example, Q1 could be French + music, Q2 could be online courses, etc. This way you're still pursuing everything, just not all at the same time.\n\nFor those 3-4 free hours you have, try time blocking. Set specific days for specific activities - maybe Monday\/Wednesday for French, Tuesday\/Thursday for music, etc. Having a schedule eliminates the daily \"what should I do?\" decision that often leads to defaulting to TV.\n\nFor the work burnout issue - consider taking a proper break right after work instead of jumping straight into activities. A 30-minute reset (meditation, quick walk, whatever works for you) can help transition your brain from work mode to personal time.\n\nRegarding the business idea - that's actually something you could start preparing for gradually. Use one of your quarterly blocks to research and plan. You don't need to quit your job immediately to start laying the groundwork.\n\nRemember that consistency beats intensity. Even 30 minutes of focused practice on something is better than an irregular schedule of longer sessions. Start small, stick to your schedule, and adjust as needed.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've got a lot of passions and interests, but not enough hours in the day to pursue them all. First, let's give you credit for already being pretty efficient with your time - working from home, fitting in chores during the day, and prioritizing time with your dog is no small feat. \n\nOne strategy that might help is to try to group similar activities together and allocate specific times for them. For example, you could dedicate one evening a week to music practice, another to language learning, and so on. This can help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on the 80\/20 rule - what are the 20% of activities that will give you 80% of the fulfillment and joy? Identify your top priorities and allocate your limited time to those first. It's not about giving up on all your other interests, but about being realistic about what you can fit in.\n\nIt might also be helpful to start small - instead of trying to launch your own company or become fluent in French overnight, break down these big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make them feel less daunting and allow you to make progress without burning out.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the TV time - everyone needs downtime, and it's okay to take a break and recharge. The key is to find a balance that works for you, and to be intentional about how you're spending your free time.

Here's my take:\n\nFirst, recognize that you can't do everything at once, and that's okay.

Allocate specific blocks of time to specific activities. Even 30 minutes of French a day is better than nothing and will keep you moving forward. Schedule it like you would a meeting.\n\nFor the startup idea, break it down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of \"start a company,\" think \"research one potential business idea for 30 minutes this week.\" Small wins build momentum.\n\nAlso, be realistic about your energy levels. If you're fried after work, don't beat yourself up for needing to unwind.

Consistency is key, so try to stick to the same sleep schedule even on weekends. \n\nCreating a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to wind down.

Once you're up, expose yourself to natural light as soon as possible to help reset your internal clock.\n\nLastly, give yourself something to look forward to in the morning, like a delicious breakfast or a few minutes of quiet time with a cup of coffee.

Having a compelling reason to get up makes a huge difference.\n\nFor the actual wake-up part: Put your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. Once you're up, immediately open your curtains or step outside - natural light helps reset your circadian rhythm. The first 5 minutes are the hardest, but if you can push through those, it gets much easier.\n\nMost importantly, be consistent with your sleep schedule, even on weekends. Your body craves routine. If you stick to roughly the same sleep and wake times, your internal clock will eventually adjust and waking up early will feel more natural.\n\nRemember that feeling groggy when you first wake up is normal for everyone - it's called sleep inertia and typically lasts 15-30 minutes.

Start small\u2014pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas. The key is consistency, not intensity.\n\nAlso, consider breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Celebrate small wins to build momentum and confidence.\n\nIt might also help to find a community or accountability partner who shares your interests. Having someone to share progress with can make the journey feel less isolating and more motivating.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and remember that every small step forward is a victory. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, you're already ahead of many people by identifying the root cause - that's huge. The good news is that deep-seated aversions can absolutely be rewired, but it requires a different approach than traditional discipline-based methods.\n\nStart by completely removing the word \"discipline\" from your vocabulary for now. Instead, think in terms of tiny experiments and play. Your brain has associated discipline with threat, so we need to bypass that defense mechanism entirely.\n\nPick something absurdly small related to one of your interests - so small it feels almost meaningless. For game dev, maybe it's opening your development environment for 30 seconds. For music, maybe it's playing a single note. The key is to make it so easy that your brain's defenses don't activate.\n\nDo this tiny thing once. That's it. No pressure to continue, no expectations of progress. The next day, do it again. If you feel any resistance, make it even smaller. We're building evidence for your brain that engaging with these activities is safe.\n\nOnly once these micro-actions feel completely neutral (usually takes 1-2 weeks) do you slightly expand them. Add 30 more seconds. Play two notes instead of one. The moment you feel that wall coming up, scale back immediately.\n\nThis isn't about willpower or pushing through. It's about gradually proving to your nervous system that these activities are safe and rewarding. Many people have overcome similar aversions this way - by going so small that the brain's protective mechanisms don't get triggered.\n\nRemember: You're not trying to fix yourself or overcome anything. You're just running tiny, safe experiments to collect data. That's all.",
    "comment_llama":"It's amazing that you've identified the root cause of your struggles, and that in itself is a huge step forward. Overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline won't be easy, but it's definitely possible. One approach could be to start by reframing your perception of discipline - instead of seeing it as a restrictive or punitive force, try to view it as a tool for achieving freedom and autonomy in the areas that matter most to you. \n\nFor example, as a game developer, you might start by setting incredibly small, almost ridiculously easy goals for yourself, like working on a project for just 5-10 minutes a day. This can help build momentum and make the idea of discipline less daunting. It's also important to focus on progress, not perfection - don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, just acknowledge the setback and get back on track.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore the underlying reasons for your aversion to discipline. Was there a particular event or experience in your childhood that led to this feeling? Understanding the root cause can help you address it more effectively. Additionally, consider seeking out supportive communities or accountability partners who can encourage and motivate you without being too pushy or demanding.\n\nAs for people who have overcome similar challenges, there are many stories of individuals who have successfully developed discipline and achieved their goals despite initial resistance. It's often a matter of finding the right strategies, support systems, and mindset shifts that work for you. You might find inspiration in the stories of people like James Clear, who writes about building good habits and overcoming obstacles, or Josh Waitzkin, who has written about cultivating discipline and resilience in pursuit of his passions.\n\nRemember, overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take it one step at a time, and to be patient with yourself as you work through this process. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the issue and seeking help - now it's just a matter of finding the right approach and support to help you move forward.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, that sounds incredibly frustrating, and you're definitely not alone in struggling with deeply rooted aversions. It's awesome that you're actively trying to understand and address it.\n\nInstead of tackling \"discipline\" head-on, maybe try reframing it. Think of it less as a rigid set of rules and more as a set of *agreements* you make with yourself to achieve something you genuinely want.\n\nSince you're a game developer, could you gamify your own life? Break down tasks into tiny, achievable quests with small rewards. Focus on the *process* of building a habit, not the *outcome* of finishing a game or mastering scales. For example, instead of \"learn scales,\" try \"practice one scale for 5 minutes every day.\" The goal is consistency, not perfection.\n\nAlso, consider therapy if you aren't already. A therapist specializing in trauma or attachment issues might help you unpack the childhood roots of this aversion and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Shame is a motivation killer. Celebrate small wins, acknowledge your progress, and remember that setbacks are part of the process. You've got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"One approach is to focus on the tiniest, most manageable actions possible and build from there. Instead of trying to finish a game or fully learn music theory, aim for something so small you almost can\u2019t resist it\u2014like coding for just five minutes or practicing one simple scale. The goal isn\u2019t to achieve the entire thing at once but to consistently show yourself you can follow through in little bursts. Over time, these small, repeated wins can help change your attitude toward discipline. It also helps to celebrate each effort rather than waiting for a big outcome, so you start associating discipline with reward instead of dread.",

    "post_body":"Hey everyone, I'm a 24 year old male, and I really need some wisdom words because I think I'm at the bottom of my life. Last February, I had a breakup. It was a 1-year relationship, and she was my first true love ever. I really wanted us to work so badly, but it didn't happen. It was a \"healthy\" breakup, but I just couldn't accept it. She wanted us to stay \"friends,\" but I said no. Even if it hurt me so fucking bad. The thing is that I felt safe during her. I showed too much emotion. I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore. I don't want to be famous and get easily affected by my emotions. I want to know how to control my mind and my emotions so people can rely on me in the future. And I have absolutely no idea where to start because I feel lost every time.I don't really know if it's the right sub to post in, but I like how the guys think here.\nthanks,\n\u00a0",

You're just human.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. Breakups can be really tough, and it's normal to feel lost afterward. The good news is that you can definitely work on building mental and physical strength, and it all starts with small, consistent steps.\n\nFor mental discipline, try starting with mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and learn to manage them better. Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal. It could be as basic as a daily walk or a short workout routine. Exercise is a powerful way to boost your mood and build resilience.\n\nRemember, it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable. It's part of being human. The key is learning how to balance them and not let them control you. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey man, going through a tough breakup is rough, but it's good that you're looking to grow from this experience. Being vulnerable and showing emotions isn't a weakness - it takes real strength to be open with someone. That said, I understand wanting to build better emotional regulation.\n\nStart with small, consistent practices that help you develop mental toughness. Exercise is incredibly effective for this - even just 15 minutes of daily bodyweight exercises will build both physical and mental resilience. When you push through those last few pushups even when your arms are shaking, you're training your mind as much as your body.\n\nFor emotional control, meditation is your friend. Download a free app like Insight Timer and start with just 5 minutes each morning. It teaches you to observe your emotions without being controlled by them. Over time, you'll notice yourself responding to situations rather than reacting.\n\nKeep a simple journal where you track your daily habits and reflect on your progress. Writing helps process emotions in a healthy way while keeping you focused on growth.\n\nRemember that being reliable doesn't mean being emotionless - it means having the strength to handle emotions productively. Take it one day at a time, focus on these foundational habits, and you'll gradually build the mental toughness you're looking for.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your weaknesses and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking the first step. Controlling your emotions and building mental toughness is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. One thing you could start with is developing a daily routine that includes physical exercise, meditation, or journaling - these activities can help you clear your mind, release tension, and gain clarity on your thoughts and feelings. It's also important to set small, achievable goals for yourself and work towards them, which can help build confidence and a sense of control. As for emotional vulnerability, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but learning to balance it with emotional regulation can be helpful. You might find it useful to read up on stoicism or emotional intelligence, as these topics can provide valuable insights on how to manage your emotions and develop a stronger sense of self. Remember that it's okay to feel lost, and it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to figure everything out right now. Just focus on making progress, and be kind to yourself along the way.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey man, sorry to hear you're going through a rough patch. Breakups are tough, especially when it's your first real love. It's good you recognized that staying \"friends\" wouldn't have been healthy for you.\n\nAs for getting more disciplined and in control of your emotions, it's a journey, not a switch you can flip. A good starting point is focusing on small, achievable goals. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once.\n\nThink about one or two areas where you want to improve. Maybe it's hitting the gym a few times a week, learning a new skill, or even just consistently making your bed every morning. The key is consistency. When you start seeing yourself stick to these small commitments, it builds confidence and momentum.\n\nAlso, consider exploring mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and how you react to them. There are tons of free apps and resources online to get you started.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to seek professional help if you're really struggling.

Write down a few sentences about the person you want to become and revisit it when you feel old patterns creeping in. You don\u2019t have to shut off all emotion; you just want to respond more wisely. Meditation or slow breathing can help you pause instead of reacting. Over time, you\u2019ll see your confidence and self-control grow, especially if you keep tracking progress. Remember, it\u2019s not about never feeling vulnerable again; it\u2019s about proving to yourself day after day that you can handle life\u2019s ups and downs without letting them derail you.",

    "post_body":"I'm practicing dopamine detox these days because its not like I just want to try, I simply need it. I'm a very distracted person which simply hampers my studies. I've started with common things like no social media, no random searching on the internet, no youtube, not using phone (just using twice, once in the morning and once at night just to check mails, read some good posts on reddit etc.), no music (I don't watch movies and shows that much so thats already in control). \n\nProblem is while I study or work on something else as well, I feel sleepy, a lot. This problem is concerning because I have a healthy diet, and sleep for atleast 6-7 hours at night (usually I go to bed around 12), yet....\n\nPreviously in my old routine, I used to just put on the headphones and listen to music while working. That used to keep my mind active. But now when I fully want to concentrate, without music or anything, I just can't. No doubt, I've improved a lot due to my new routine and practice but feeling sleepy is the issue. \n\nAny advice on how to get over this? I want to control it rather than letting it control me and sabotaging my studies or work.",
    "comment_best_human":"You're going to get some great advice on this, but I'll offer up something that will sound bizarre, but hear me out: brush and floss your teeth. \n\nI was dealing with the same issue last year despite being a healthy person. Admittedly, I've never been great at brushing twice a day or flossing (I brushed once, in the morning, and NEVER flossed). However, after switching to a new dentist, it was discovered that I had a mild case of gingivitis (the dental professionals will need to correct my terminology).\n\nLong story short, it was explained to me that my body uses energy to fight off the infection of gingivitis, constantly; and that chronic fatigue is a consequence.

    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you're making some great strides with your dopamine detox, but the sleepiness is definitely a hurdle. Here are a few things you might try: \n\n1. **Adjust Your Sleep Schedule**: Even though you're getting 6-7 hours, you might need a bit more. Try going to bed earlier and see if that helps. Everyone's sleep needs are different, and sometimes just an extra hour can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Take Short Breaks**: Implement the Pomodoro Technique\u2014work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and prevent that sleepy feeling.\n\n3. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes, feeling sleepy can be a sign of dehydration. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n4. **Natural Light and Fresh Air**: Try to study near a window or take short walks outside. Natural light and fresh air can be invigorating and help keep you alert.\n\n5. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some light exercise into your routine. Even a quick 10-minute workout can boost your energy levels.\n\n6. **Mindful Music**: If music helped you before, consider using instrumental or ambient music that won't distract you but can keep your mind engaged.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works best for you. Keep experimenting with small changes until you find the right balance. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Your sleepiness might actually be related to your sleep schedule rather than just the dopamine detox. While 6-7 hours can work for some people, most adults need 7-9 hours, and going to bed at midnight can throw off your natural circadian rhythm. Try shifting your bedtime earlier (like 10:30 PM) and aim for 8 hours of sleep consistently.\n\nFor staying alert while studying without music, there are several effective strategies you can try. Take short breaks every 45-50 minutes and do some light exercise - even just walking around the room or doing jumping jacks can help. Keep your study space well-lit and slightly cool. Staying hydrated is also crucial - sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration.\n\nYou might also consider breaking up longer study sessions into smaller chunks with different activities. For example, alternate between reading, writing, and problem-solving. This variety can help maintain alertness without relying on external stimulation like music.\n\nIf you really miss the background noise, try white noise or nature sounds instead of music - they can provide ambient sound without the dopamine hit that comes from actual songs. You could gradually phase these out as you adjust to studying in silence.\n\nRemember that it's normal to feel some fatigue while your brain adjusts to less stimulation. Give yourself at least a few weeks to adapt to this new routine. The sleepiness should improve as your body and mind adjust to the lower baseline of stimulation.",
    "comment_llama":"It's great that you're taking proactive steps with your dopamine detox and recognizing the challenges that come with it. The sleepiness you're experiencing could be due to a few factors, such as your brain adjusting to the lack of constant stimulation or possibly even a sign of mental fatigue from focusing intensely without breaks. One strategy you might consider is incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to help increase your energy levels and alertness. Additionally, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between, allowing yourself time to rest and recharge. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique and can be really helpful in maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. It might also be worth experimenting with your sleep schedule, trying to go to bed a bit earlier to see if that improves the quality of your sleep and subsequently your alertness during the day.

Instead of going back to music, maybe try incorporating other ways to keep yourself alert. Have you considered things like:\n\n*   **Short breaks with physical activity?** Even a quick walk or some jumping jacks can make a difference.\n*   **Adjusting your study environment?** Make sure you have good lighting and a comfortable but not *too* comfortable chair. A slightly cooler room temperature can also help.\n*   **Trying different study techniques?** Maybe the way you're studying is just boring you. Experiment with active recall, spaced repetition, or the Feynman technique.\n*   **Hydration and snacks?** Dehydration can cause fatigue, and a healthy snack can provide a quick energy boost. Think fruits, nuts, or yogurt.\n*   **Timing?** Maybe the time you study is the problem. Try studying at different times of the day when you feel more alert.\n\nAlso, 6-7 hours of sleep might not be enough for you. Everyone's different. Experiment with getting closer to 8 hours to see if that helps. And make sure that sleep is quality sleep \u2013 a dark, quiet room, and no screens before bed.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're taking this step towards your education\u2014it's never too late to start. Getting your GED is a solid first move. You can find GED prep classes at local community colleges or adult education centers, and there are plenty of online resources too. Websites like GED.com can guide you to official practice tests and study materials. Once you feel ready, you can schedule your test through the same site. \n\nAs for college, many community colleges have programs specifically designed for adult learners and those returning to education. They often offer support services to help you transition smoothly. It might be worth reaching out to a few to see what they offer. \n\nBuilding discipline will be key, so try setting small, manageable goals for your study routine.

    "comment_claude":"You're absolutely not too far gone - many people have been in similar situations and successfully gotten their education back on track. The good news is that you've already taken the hardest step by deciding to make a change.\n\nFor your GED, start by checking your state's official GED testing website (just Google \"[your state] GED testing\"). Most areas offer free or low-cost GED prep classes through community colleges or adult education centers. These programs are specifically designed for people in situations like yours.\n\nYour local library is also a great resource - they often know about local GED programs and might offer free study materials. Many community colleges have \"Adult Basic Education\" departments that can help you create a study plan and prepare for the test.\n\nOnce you have your GED, community college is an excellent path to a four-year degree. They're used to working with non-traditional students and often have extra support services. Plus, starting at a community college can save you money on your first two years of college credits.\n\nTake it one step at a time - first focus on getting your GED, then worry about college applications. Set aside specific study times each day, even if it's just an hour. Small, consistent efforts add up quickly.\n\nRemember that your past doesn't define your future. You recognized something you want to change and you're taking action - that shows real maturity and self-awareness. Those qualities will serve you well in your educational journey.",

First, let's break down the steps you can take to get back on track. Getting your GED is a great starting point, and you can start by visiting the official GED website to find testing centers and study materials in your area. Many community colleges also offer GED prep classes, which might be a good resource for you.\n\nIn terms of college, many institutions have programs specifically designed for non-traditional students or those who didn't complete high school. You might want to look into colleges that offer adult education or bridge programs, which can help you transition into higher education. It's also worth reaching out to the admissions offices of colleges you're interested in to ask about their requirements and support services for students with non-traditional educational backgrounds.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to start working towards your goals, and there are many people who have successfully gone back to school in their 20s or even later. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging what you want to achieve, so now it's just a matter of taking it one step at a time. Keep in mind that you may also be eligible for financial aid or scholarships, so be sure to explore those options as well.

Spring 2024 is totally achievable.\n\nFirst, breathe. You've already taken the biggest step by recognizing what you want and reaching out.\n\nOkay, practical steps: GED is definitely the way to go. Start by Googling \"GED prep classes near me\" or \"[your city\/county] adult education.\" Community colleges often have GED programs, and they're usually very affordable, sometimes even free. These programs will help you brush up on the subjects and give you practice tests.\n\nDon't worry about what grade you \"officially\" finished. The GED covers the core high school subjects. The prep classes will assess your current level and help you focus on what you need to learn.\n\nAs for discipline, try breaking down the GED prep into small, manageable chunks. Maybe commit to studying for 30 minutes, 3 times a week to start. Use a timer and reward yourself with something small after each session. Consistency is key.\n\nAlso, look into resources for learning disabilities. Even if you were never officially diagnosed, understanding how you learn best can make a huge difference. Many adult education centers offer learning assessments and support services.\n\nYou got this! It's going to take effort, but you're clearly motivated, and that's half the battle. Good luck!\n",

Here\u2019s a scenario:  \n\nJust suppose you\u2019re walking along a paved highway toward a beautiful horizon.  The sun is setting just right, you feel the warm air and maybe even a gentle breeze.  As you\u2019re walking you notice how far you\u2019ve come, that\u2019s living in the gain.  The opposite is focusing on how much further you have to go or living in the gap between where you are and where you have yet to go.  \n\nWhen we measure success based on how far we\u2019ve come we see what successes we have had up until now.  On the other hand, when we measure success based on how far we have to go we always feel disappointed.  Bc the thing is we can never actually get to the horizon. No matter how far we walk, run, drive.  The horizon isn\u2019t there for us to get to. These are our ideals.  We will never actually measure up to our ideal self (which is usually ego driven).

Start small - pick just ONE thing you want to accomplish tomorrow and commit to doing it, no matter how minor it seems. Maybe it's making your bed, going for a 10-minute walk, or reading one page of a book.\n\nThe key is building momentum through small wins. Once you complete that first task, you'll likely feel motivated to do a bit more. But don't overwhelm yourself trying to fix everything at once. Focus on that single daily commitment for a week before adding anything else.\n\nAnother helpful approach is setting a specific time for your chosen task. \"I'll do it sometime today\" often becomes \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" Instead, decide \"I'll do this at 9am\" and treat it like an important appointment.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back up when you slip. Everyone goes through slumps. What matters is taking that first step to break out of it, even if it's a tiny one. Start tomorrow with that one committed task, and build from there.\n\nWhat's one small thing you could commit to doing tomorrow?",
    "comment_llama":"It's normal to go through slumps, and recognizing you're in one is the first step to getting out. One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, set a tiny goal for yourself each day, like doing one productive task or exercising for just 10 minutes. Often, getting that little bit of momentum can help build discipline and make it easier to take on more. Additionally, try to identify what's causing your slump - is it lack of motivation, burnout, or something else? Once you understand the root cause, you can start working on a plan to address it. Lastly, be kind to yourself and don't beat yourself up over feeling lazy - it's okay to have off days, and it doesn't define your entire potential.

Acknowledge you're in a slump and that it's temporary.\n\nSecond, start ridiculously small. Forget about \"meaningful\" for now. Think *tiny*. Like, \"I will do one push-up\" or \"I will read one page of a book.\" The goal is to break the inertia and get a small win. Seriously, one push-up. You'll probably do more, but the pressure is off.\n\nThird, focus on ONE thing. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick the one habit that, if you did it consistently, would make the biggest difference. Maybe it's exercise, maybe it's working on a specific project. Just one.\n\nFinally, be patient and kind to yourself. It takes time to build momentum. Celebrate those small wins and don't get discouraged if you have setbacks. You got this!\n",

It also helps to block off distractions\u2014put your phone in another room if you can, and close any tabs you don\u2019t need. Finally, don\u2019t go too hard on yourself if you slip up.

The main tip to wake up early is to sleep early and always the same time, including weekends, in a few days you'll naturally wake up the same hour everyday, the problem is that usually when our system is understanding our new routine we screw up during the weekend.   \nTalking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas\/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   \nIn a few days you'll love your new routine and you'll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don't have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there's always a little windows to stick something new you want to try.

For example, commit to a 10-minute workout or a short walk with your dog right after work. This can help build momentum without feeling overwhelming.

Consistency is key, so be patient with yourself as you build these habits. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Starting small and building consistency is key here. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick 1-2 habits to focus on first. Since working out and walking your dog are already somewhat in your routine, let's start there.\n\nFor the early morning challenge - don't force yourself to become a morning person overnight. Try shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier each week. When you do wake up, immediately put on your workout clothes and take your dog for a quick walk. The movement and fresh air will help wake you up naturally.\n\nA solid after-work routine could look like this: Come home, change clothes, 20-minute dog walk, workout for 30 minutes, then cook dinner. The key is doing these activities in the same order every day until they become automatic.\n\nFor cooking, try meal prepping on weekends so you have easy healthy options ready during the week. This frees up time for other activities like pursuing a new hobby.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. Start with these basics and gradually add more as these become habits. Even 10 minutes of exercise or a quick walk with your dog is better than nothing. Build from there.\n\nWhat specific hobby were you thinking about learning? That could be a great reward activity after completing your core routine.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve outside of work, which is great. To help you establish a consistent routine, let's break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Since waking up early is your biggest challenge, why not start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day? This can give you a small window to ease into your morning routine, whether that's a short walk with your dog or some light stretching to get yourself moving. As you get into this habit, you can gradually increase the wake-up time and incorporate other activities like working out or learning your new hobby. It might also be helpful to establish a calming pre-bedtime routine to improve the quality of your sleep, making it easier to wake up in the morning. What do you think is a reasonable wake-up time for you to aim for, and what's one activity you'd like to prioritize in your morning routine?",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get it, building a routine after work can be tough, especially when you're already tired. It sounds like you've got some good goals though!\n\nFor the inconsistent workouts, maybe try scheduling them like appointments in your calendar and treating them as non-negotiable. Even a short 20-minute workout is better than nothing.\n\nRegarding waking up early, that's a common struggle. Instead of drastically changing your wake-up time, try shifting it by just 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired time. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep! It's easier to wake up early when you're well-rested. Maybe try putting your alarm clock across the room so you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off.\n\nFor the dog walks, could you tie it to something you already do? Like, right after you finish dinner, it's dog walk time. That way, it becomes a habit linked to an existing routine.\n\nFinally, for the new hobby, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve found it helpful to focus on one or two habits at first and build from there. If waking up early is tough, try going to bed a bit earlier and maybe cut down on screen time before sleep so you\u2019re in a better position to get up. You could also schedule certain tasks right after work instead so you ride the momentum of the day\u2014take the dog for a walk, then head straight to a workout or meal prep. Once you\u2019re comfortable doing those a few times a week, you can start pushing your wake-up time back in small increments (like 15 minutes earlier every few days). It\u2019s easier to stick with a plan if it\u2019s realistic and if you give yourself some leeway to adapt.

First off, let's acknowledge that you've made it through some incredibly tough circumstances, and that in itself is something to be proud of. It's understandable that you feel lost and unsure about what you want from life right now, especially given everything you've been through. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to figure out your entire life's purpose, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable goals. What are some things you enjoy doing, or things you've always wanted to try? It could be something as simple as taking a different route on your Uber Eats deliveries, or trying out a new hobby in your free time. Having something to look forward to, no matter how small it seems, can help build momentum and motivation.\n\nIt's also really important that you're recognizing the coping mechanisms you've been using (like weed and porn) might not be serving you well in the long run. That takes a lot of self-awareness, and it's a great first step towards making some positive changes. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the trauma and mental health struggles you're facing? It might be really helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and guidance as you navigate all this.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel like being alive is a burden sometimes - especially when you've been dealing with as much pain and hardship as you have.

Taking care of your mental health is the foundation for everything else.\n\nAs for feeling like your brain is mush, maybe try incorporating some simple brain-boosting activities. Even 15 minutes of reading, doing a puzzle, or learning something new online could help you feel more engaged.\n\nDon't put too much pressure on yourself to figure everything out at once.

Next, try adding a short daily habit that feeds your mind or body, like going for a walk or reading for ten minutes. This might seem tiny, but stacking small wins helps you build consistency and confidence over time. As you\u2019re doing Uber Eats, maybe use those quieter moments between deliveries to think about interests you\u2019d like to explore, jobs you might look into, or even steps toward going back to school when you feel ready. If possible, consider talking to a professional or a trusted mentor who can guide you in sorting out your goals and managing those heavy emotions. Growth can feel slow, but the discipline you build now\u2014through small, regular habits\u2014creates the foundation for bigger changes later. You\u2019ve already stuck it out through so much; that resilience can be the backbone of a more stable and hopeful future.",

I advise that you follow these general rules\n1. the 60 second rule: if you catch yourself procrastinating, tell yourself that you will just work for 60 seconds. afterwards, it will be significantly easier for you to continue working.\n\n2. the two minute habit rule: slowly integrate studying and exercise as habits in your life. however, when you start, you may get a surge of motivation and do too much. if you do this, you will burn out. instead, start by doing the habit in under two minutes a day, and build it up from there. instead of trying to do a full workout routine every day, just do 90 seconds worth of push-ups a day.\n\n3. meditate daily: one of the habits you integrate should be mindfulness meditation. it will allow you to recognize when you are procrastinating faster, and it will make it easier for you to resist the procrastination.\n\n4. the two day rule: some days you just won\u2019t do a habit. it happens. maybe something came up, or you just had a bad day. when this happens, just don\u2019t let it happen two days in a row, or the habit will begin to fade.\n\n5. don\u2019t beat yourself up. progress comes slow, and as i mentioned before, this is something everyone experiences.",
    "comment_10th_human":"I would say break things down into manageable chunks. Best advice I\u2019ve ever gotten. \n\nI was in the military and was trying to get into special forces. The workouts were long and brutal. Four hour pool sessions. \n\nFor repetitions during push-ups, pull ups, burpees, etc knowing that you have 100 burpees ahead of you is daunting and if you think about it too much you will quit. But if you break it down into manageable chunks, you can keep going no matter what. For example when I knew I had 100 I would start knocking them out. Maybe 20 at a time. Then it would get hard so I would only focus on doing 10. Then 5. Then 2. Break things up into manageable chunks!\n\nI apply this to my life in many ways. When I know I have dishes to clean, laundry to do, meals to prep, etc. I pick one, and start with it. Don\u2019t think about the others. Just start!

For example, if you need to study, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes and focus solely on that. Once the timer goes off, take a short break and then decide if you want to do another round. This technique, often called the Pomodoro Technique, can make tasks feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Also, try to identify the specific distractions that pull you away and find ways to minimize them, like putting your phone in another room or using apps that block distracting websites. Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself and celebrate small wins along the way. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"This is a common struggle - your mind wants the reward but resists doing the work. The key is to make starting easier than your brain's resistance. Try this: commit to just 5 minutes of studying or working out. That's it. The goal isn't to complete everything, just to begin. Usually once you start, continuing becomes much easier.\n\nFor studying, set a timer for 5 minutes and open your materials. For working out, put on your exercise clothes and do literally one set or 5 minutes of movement. If you want to stop after that, fine. But you'll often find yourself naturally wanting to continue once you've broken through that initial resistance.\n\nAnother effective approach is to remove decision-making from the equation. Pick specific times for these activities and treat them like non-negotiable appointments. \"Tuesday at 4pm is study time\" leaves less room for your mind to bounce around looking for excuses.\n\nStart small, be consistent, and gradually build up. Your discipline is like a muscle - it gets stronger with regular exercise, but you need to start with manageable weights. Focus on showing up every day rather than having perfect sessions. The consistency matters more than intensity when you're building these habits.",

    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to know what you *should* do but still struggle to actually do it. A couple of things that might help:\n\nFirst, try breaking down those big tasks (studying, working out) into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of \"study,\" it's \"open the textbook to page 1.\" Or instead of \"work out,\" it's \"put on workout clothes.\" Seriously, make it so easy you almost can't say no. Once you've done that tiny step, the momentum often carries you forward.\n\nSecond, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique. Set a timer for 25 minutes of focused work, then take a 5-minute break. Knowing you only have to focus for a short burst can make it less daunting.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself.

It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or spending 5 minutes sketching or writing. The key is consistency, not intensity.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve in both discipline and creativity. Break these down into manageable tasks. For example, if you want to write a book, start with writing 100 words a day.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your new habit at the same time every day. This helps your brain associate that time with the activity, making it easier to stick with it.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, no matter how small.

    "comment_claude":"The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum gradually. Your brain won't rewire overnight, but you can train it through consistent tiny actions. Pick one simple thing you want to do - maybe writing for 5 minutes, drawing for 10 minutes, or working on a project for 15 minutes. Make it so easy you can't say no.\n\nThen set a specific time each day for this mini-task. The time of day matters less than consistency. When that time comes, just do that one tiny thing. Don't worry about doing more, even if you feel motivated to. Build the habit first.\n\nAfter a couple weeks of consistency with your mini-task, you can gradually increase the time or add another small habit. The goal is to prove to yourself that you can follow through. Each small win reinforces that you ARE capable of doing things, not just dreaming about them.\n\nFor the creativity aspect - set aside dedicated time to consume inspiring content in your field of interest, but limit it to maybe 20% of your practice time. The other 80% should be actually creating, even if it's bad at first. Remember that all those successful people you admire started somewhere too, usually with work they weren't proud of.\n\nYour brain will resist change at first. That's normal. But if you stick to tiny, consistent actions, you'll slowly build new neural pathways. Focus on the process rather than results.

    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a motivation gap, which is totally common. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as doing one load of laundry, or spending 10 minutes working on a creative project. The idea is to build momentum and get yourself used to taking action, rather than just imagining it. Additionally, you might find it helpful to explore the concept of \"implementation intentions\" - this is where you specify when and where you'll take a specific action, which can help make it feel more concrete and achievable. For example, you might say to yourself \"at 7am tomorrow, I'll spend 30 minutes working on my novel\". By making a clear plan and starting small, you can begin to build discipline and creativity habits that will serve you well in the long run.",

    "post_body":"Where do I begin?\n\nI'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\n\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)\n\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion\/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \"career\" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\n\nI forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.",
    "comment_best_human":"First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \n\n\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \n\n\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \"!?!\" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \n\n\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \n\n\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \n\n\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \n\n\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do\/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \n\n\nIf you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \n\n\n3) Go to trade school\/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \n\n\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \n\n\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \n\n\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \n\n\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.",

Many people find fulfilling careers through vocational training or apprenticeships, which can be more affordable and quicker to complete. Look into programs that might interest you, even if it's just a little bit, and see if they offer any financial aid or scholarships.\n\nRegarding your interests, it's okay not to have a clear passion right now. Try exploring different fields through free online courses (like Coursera or Khan Academy) to see what might catch your attention. Sometimes, interests develop over time and with exposure to new things.\n\nLastly, learning to drive can open up more job opportunities.

While the job search has been frustrating, expand your search beyond retail. Look into:\n- Restaurant work (dishwashing, bussing tables)\n- Warehouse\/fulfillment centers\n- Call centers\n- Security guard positions\n- Package handling (UPS, FedEx)\n\nThese often have high turnover and frequently hire entry-level workers.

You're 18 and facing some seriously tough circumstances. Don't beat yourself up for not having it all figured out.\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps. Forget the grand plan for now. Focus on the immediate next steps.\n\n1.  **Job Search:** Keep applying. CVS and Sprouts are good starting points. Expand your search to include places like fast food restaurants, grocery stores (stocking shelves), warehouses, or even cleaning services. These often have high turnover and are more likely to hire someone without experience. Tailor your resume to each job, highlighting any skills you *do* have, even if they seem small (e.g., \"organized household chores,\" \"helped family with computer issues\"). Even volunteering counts!\n\n2.  **Skills & Resume:** Since you're having trouble getting callbacks, consider free online courses to boost your resume. Websites like Coursera, edX, and even YouTube have tons of free courses on everything from basic computer skills to customer service. Completing even a short course shows initiative.\n\n3.  **Transportation:** This is a tough one without money. Look into public transportation options in your area. Even if it's limited, it's better than nothing. Also, see if there are any local programs that offer assistance with transportation for job seekers.\n\n4.  **College:** College is a great goal, but it doesn't have to be right now. Working and saving *does* work, but it takes time and discipline. Start small. Set a realistic savings goal each month, even if it's just $25.\n\n5.  **Interests:** The \"interest hopping\" is common at your age. Don't pressure yourself to find your \"passion\" right now. Instead, try new things without the expectation of loving them forever. Libraries often have free workshops and events. Community centers might offer affordable classes. Just explore!\n\n6.  **Dysfunctional Family:** This is the hardest part. Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel unsafe, reach out to a trusted friend, family member (if possible), or a local support organization. There are resources available to help you navigate this.\n\nThe key here is to break down these big problems into smaller, actionable steps. Focus on one thing at a time. Celebrate small victories.

Try daily job searches in different places, or look for roles you can do online\u2014anything to get income and build experience. Even short-term work teaches responsibility and gives you something to put on a resume. If college interests you at all, check out community colleges or trade schools\u2014many offer financial aid or grants that don\u2019t involve family support. Don\u2019t worry about having a lifelong passion yet; most people uncover interests by trying different things. You don\u2019t need to know your final career right now. Start with a short-term goal, get some money and skills under your belt, and use any free resources (like public libraries or online courses) for learning. Gradually, you\u2019ll figure out what you actually like doing, and you\u2019ll have the discipline and experience to move forward.",

    "comment_best_human":"That\u2019s a tough one. Seems like the best thing I\u2019ve done is to create a first step that is simply too small to fail. I want to walk? I just focus on putting on my shoes. Once I\u2019ve done that I\u2019m much more likely to actually continue on with the task.",
    "comment_10th_human":"I notice I\u2019m deepest in the flow state when I use mind muscle connection in any physical sport",
    "comment_gpt4":"One trick that really helped me was the \"two-minute rule.\" Basically, if a habit takes less than two minutes to start, just do it. This helps overcome the initial resistance and makes it easier to build momentum. For example, if you want to start reading daily, just commit to reading one page. Often, you'll find that once you start, you'll want to keep going. Also, try to attach the new habit to an existing one. If you already have a morning coffee routine, use that time to do a quick meditation or plan your day. Consistency is key, so even small steps count. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Getting into a flow state consistently comes down to creating the right environment and triggers that signal \"it's time to work.\" Start small - pick one habit you want to build and create a clear pre-work ritual. This could be as simple as sitting at the same spot, putting on specific music, or doing 2-3 minutes of breathing exercises before starting.\n\nThe key is reducing friction. Set up your workspace the night before. Put everything you need within arm's reach. Remove distractions like your phone or browser notifications. Make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it.\n\nWhat helped me most was the \"just 5 minutes\" rule. Tell yourself you only have to work for 5 minutes. Usually once you start, momentum takes over and you'll keep going. If not, that's fine - you still built the habit. Consistency matters more than duration early on.\n\nTrack your progress with a simple habit tracker. Seeing those checkmarks build up creates a powerful motivation to maintain your streak. When you do miss a day (it happens), jump right back in the next day. Don't let one slip become a slide.\n\nRemember that flow states aren't something you force - they emerge when you've reduced mental resistance through consistent practice. Focus first on showing up daily, even if just briefly. The flow will follow naturally as the habit strengthens.",
    "comment_llama":"One technique that has helped many people develop consistent habits is to start small and focus on building a chain of successes, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. For example, if you want to develop a daily writing habit, start by committing to write for just 10-15 minutes each day, and gradually increase the time as the habit becomes more ingrained. It's also important to identify your why - what motivates you to want to develop these habits in the first place? Reminding yourself of your underlying goals and values can help you stay focused and motivated, even when the going gets tough. Additionally, tracking your progress and holding yourself accountable can be a powerful tool - consider using a habit tracker or journal to monitor your progress and reflect on what's working and what areas need improvement.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I've been there! Turning occasional habits into daily ones is tough, but totally doable. One thing that helped me was focusing on *why* I wanted to build the habit in the first place. Connecting it to a bigger goal made it more meaningful.\n\nAlso, don't try to change everything at once. Pick *one* habit to focus on, and make it ridiculously easy to start. Like, if you want to read more, start with just reading one page a day. The key is consistency, even if it's a tiny amount. Once that's locked in, you can gradually increase it. Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"For me, the biggest cheat code to building consistent habits was starting smaller than I thought necessary. Instead of skipping a day or waiting for motivation, I\u2019d force myself to show up for just five minutes. With time, that short daily commitment became part of my routine, and it got easier to expand it. Another thing that helped was creating a ritual around the activity\u2014like making coffee, putting on a certain playlist, or using the same desk setup\u2014so my brain recognized it was time to focus. Eventually, I noticed I\u2019d slip into that flow state more often because I had fewer mental hurdles to clear. It\u2019s not about being perfect every single day, but about showing up consistently enough that your mind and body settle into a groove. The biggest trick is to keep it simple and manageable, so you\u2019re more likely to do it every day and let momentum build.",

    "post_body":"So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I will go into further details in this edit.\n\nSome comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard\/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\n\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\n\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\n\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\n\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\n\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\n\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.",
    "comment_best_human":"What you need are two things:\n\n1) A mentor. \n\nAnyone who you can trust that can support you and help you to develop the skills you need to be able to be more productive and achieve your goals. This person can help you by giving you advice, helping you train, support you when you fail or provide the kind of influence you need to reach the level of success your mind is pushing you towards. \n\n2) Habits:\n\nYou need to develop habits that will propel you into the future and towards your inner self's level of expected success. Habits are best defined as small repetitive steps that lead towards an expected outcome. They are easy to start and over time, become engrained into your daily ritual to the point of subconsciousness. \n\nBreak the mindset that your path to success is A to B. It's really A to Z. Start small. Start with easy changes that do not require a lot of effort or change who you are overnight. Build from there. Find the inner developmental triggers that work for you by expirimenting and learning about who you are as an individual. This skill will help you to direct yourself towards change and ultimately, success. \n\nUnderstand the value in trial and error. Failure is a gift that leads to success. \n\nYou can do this.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Procrastination is a tough habit to break, but it's definitely possible with some small, consistent changes. \n\nFirst, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about an entire project, focus on just the first step. This can make starting feel less overwhelming. Also, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes to work on something. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, you'll find it easier to keep going.\n\nSince the internet is a big distraction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting sites during your study time. You can also try the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make study sessions feel less daunting.\n\nFor your home tasks, try to incorporate them into your daily routine. For example, do a quick 5-minute tidy-up every day instead of waiting for that rare burst of energy. \n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to struggle, and change takes time. Celebrate small victories and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Thanks for sharing your story so openly. Your situation is really common - procrastination tends to become a cycle that feeds into itself, especially when we develop the habit early on. The good news is that you're aware of it and wanting to change at 18, which gives you plenty of time to develop better habits.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like the home environment hasn't been conducive to focused work, and you've gotten used to separating \"home time\" from \"work time.\" A practical solution would be to find a different physical space to do your work - like a library, study room, or quiet caf\u00e9. This creates a mental separation and can help break the association between home and procrastination.\n\nFor the immediate term with finals coming up, try the \"Pomodoro Technique\" - work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Start with just ONE 25-minute session. Don't think about the whole project, just commit to those 25 minutes. Most people find that getting started is the hardest part, but once you begin, it's easier to continue.\n\nFor the longer term, start building what I call \"small wins.\" Instead of trying to change everything at once, pick ONE small task - like doing laundry on a specific day of the week. Make it ridiculously easy to achieve. Once that becomes routine (which might take a few weeks), add another small habit.\n\nThe internet is clearly a major distraction for you. Try using website blockers during your study sessions. Forest is a good app that gamifies staying off your phone. You could also try the \"out of sight, out of mind\" approach - physically put your phone in another room while studying.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about being consistent. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with procrastination, and I appreciate your honesty. Given your history and the factors that contribute to your procrastination, it's clear that this is a deeply ingrained habit that will take time and effort to change. \n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you enjoy learning in classes but struggle with homework and research at home is a crucial insight. It might be helpful to explore ways to make your home study environment more conducive to productivity. This could be as simple as dedicating a specific area for studying, free from distractions like your bed or gaming console.\n\nSince you've mentioned that traditional methods like journaling or creating to-do lists haven't worked for you due to commitment issues, let's consider an alternative approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, start with small, manageable goals. For example, commit to working on a task for just 10-15 minutes without any distractions. After this short period, take a brief break before returning to the task. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help build momentum and make tasks less overwhelming.\n\nIt's also important to address your internet usage, as you've identified it as a significant contributor to your procrastination. Consider implementing website blockers or apps that help you stay focused on your tasks during certain periods of the day.\n\nGiven that finals are approaching, let's focus on creating a plan for the next week. Break down your study material into smaller chunks, and allocate specific times for reviewing each subject. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible, but don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up \u2013 simply acknowledge the setback and get back on track.\n\nLastly, remember that developing discipline and overcoming procrastination is a journey. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. You've already taken a significant step by sharing your struggles and seeking help, so keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step each day.",

Go for a 30-minute walk outside daily, do some light exercise, or try meditation. These activities help reset your mental state much better than passive entertainment.\n\nFor your lectures, try changing how you engage with the material.

Once that becomes automatic (usually takes about 2 weeks), add another small task.\n\nCreate artificial deadlines for yourself. Break larger projects into smaller chunks with self-imposed deadlines. Share these deadlines with a colleague or your boss to add accountability. This mimics the urgency that currently only comes from threats, but in a controlled way.\n\nSet up a reward system that isn't dependent on external perks. Maybe 25 minutes of focused work earns you a 5-minute break to do something you enjoy. This helps retrain your brain to associate work with positive outcomes rather than just avoiding negative ones.\n\nRemember: sustainable discipline comes from systems, not willpower. Focus on building these small habits rather than trying to force yourself to suddenly become super productive through sheer determination.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a classic case of procrastination and motivation issues. One thing that might help is to identify the underlying reasons why you're not motivated to work, beyond just the threat of being fired. Since you mentioned you don't like your job, it's possible that you're feeling unfulfilled or disconnected from your work. \n\nTry breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for yourself. This can help make your work feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, consider finding ways to make your work more meaningful or engaging, even if it's just in small ways. For example, you could try to focus on the aspects of lifestyle journalism that interest you the most, or explore ways to use your platform to tell stories that matter to you.\n\nIt might also be helpful to establish a routine or schedule for yourself, and stick to it as much as possible. This can help you build discipline and momentum, even when you're not feeling motivated. And when you do feel motivated, try to capitalize on that energy by getting as much done as you can, rather than letting it fade away after a couple of days.\n\nLastly, consider exploring what you would need to change in your job or career to make it more fulfilling for you. It's possible that there are other opportunities out there that would be a better fit for your passions and interests. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.",
    "comment_gemini":"Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of procrastination and panic, fueled by a job you don't even enjoy. That's a tough spot to be in.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the immediate problem: getting work done. Since threats are the only thing that seem to motivate you, maybe you can create artificial \"threats\" for yourself. Try setting really strict deadlines for yourself, and if you miss them, impose a consequence you actually care about. Like, donate to a cause you *don't* support, or skip one of those fancy dinners. It sounds silly, but it might trick your brain into action.\n\nMore long-term, it sounds like the real issue is the job itself. The perks are nice, but they're clearly not enough to make you happy or motivated. Maybe it's time to seriously consider what you *do* want to do. Could you leverage your journalism skills into a different field? Or maybe explore a completely different career path?\n\nStart small. Spend 30 minutes a day researching other options, networking, or even just brainstorming what a fulfilling career would look like for you. Even small steps can build momentum and give you a sense of control. It's easier to be disciplined when you're working towards something you actually care about. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to separate the perks from the real purpose of your work. If you only feel motivated when there's a threat, try creating smaller \u201cinternal deadlines\u201d that keep you moving even when no one's breathing down your neck. Break tasks into small goals, commit to doing just one or two before you reward yourself, and keep track of progress daily so you can see where the time goes. Also, it\u2019s worth taking a step back and deciding if this job is the right fit. Discipline can get you through rough patches, but if you\u2019re fundamentally unhappy, you might need to explore options that feel more fulfilling while you build better work habits.",

So for the 1 hour you study before heading to bed its actually like 40 minutes of studying time.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Balancing work, studies, and sleep can definitely be a challenge, but with a few adjustments, you can make it more manageable. First, try to establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve your sleep quality. Also, consider incorporating short power naps (10-20 minutes) during your breaks if possible, as they can help boost your energy levels without affecting your nighttime sleep. \n\nFor your work and study sessions, use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain your focus and prevent burnout. Lastly, pay attention to your diet and hydration; sometimes, sleepiness can be linked to what you eat or drink. Try to have balanced meals and stay hydrated throughout the day. Small changes can make a big difference, so experiment with what works best for you!",
    "comment_claude":"Those sleepy periods you're experiencing are actually pretty normal - they align with our natural circadian rhythms. The key is working with your body's patterns rather than fighting them.\n\nFirst, let's optimize your sleep. With those work hours, you'll want to be in bed by 10:30-11pm to get adequate rest before your 9am start. Create a wind-down routine starting an hour before bed - dim lights, avoid screens, maybe do some light stretching.\n\nFor managing daytime drowsiness: Get some movement in the morning before work, even just 10 minutes of stretching or a quick walk. When you feel that 11am slump coming, stand up and move around for 5 minutes. During lunch, try to get outside for 15 minutes - natural light helps regulate your energy levels.\n\nThe post-lunch crash around 2-3pm is super common. Keep your lunch moderate in size and low in simple carbs. Have healthy snacks ready (nuts, fruit) for when energy dips. Stay hydrated throughout the day too - dehydration makes fatigue worse.\n\nFor the evening slump, try changing tasks or taking a 5-minute break to do some jumping jacks or wall pushups. The physical movement can help push through until you finish work.\n\nStart implementing these changes gradually - maybe focus on sleep schedule first, then add the other elements over time. Your body will adjust to the routine with consistency.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a pretty demanding schedule and some fatigue issues. First, congrats on the new job - that's a great accomplishment. To balance work, studies, and sleep, let's break it down. With your work hours being 9 am - 7-8 pm, that's a long stretch. Have you considered taking short breaks throughout the day to refresh your mind and body? Even a 10-15 minute walk or some stretching exercises can help increase alertness. \n\nFor your studies, try to allocate specific timeslots outside of work hours, maybe early morning or right after dinner, when you're most focused. As for sleep, establishing a consistent bedtime routine is key. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and create a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal your body that it's time to wind down. \n\nIt might also be helpful to identify what's causing your sleepiness - is it the work itself, lack of physical activity, or something else? Once you pinpoint the cause, you can start working on solutions. Lastly, don't worry if you feel like you're not functioning at 100% all the time; it's normal to have ups and downs.

Are you eating balanced meals with enough protein and complex carbs to sustain your energy throughout the day? Avoid sugary snacks that cause energy crashes.\n\nThird, schedule short breaks during your workday. Even 5-10 minutes every hour to stand up, stretch, or walk around can make a big difference. Maybe try a quick power nap during your lunch break if you can.\n\nFinally, consider light exercise. Even a short walk in the morning or evening can boost your energy levels and improve your sleep.

If naps re-energize you, try a quick 20-minute nap during lunch, but avoid long naps that can disrupt nighttime sleep. Keep an eye on what you eat at lunch since heavy meals can make you drowsier. For studying, carve out a fixed period\u2014either before or after work\u2014so you have a mental separation between job hours and learning time. With everything on your plate, it\u2019s often about creating a routine you can stick to and making sure you protect that sleep time at night, since consistent rest will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.

Try to maintain your workout routine by either going to a gym or finding a quiet spot in\/around the house for home workouts.

For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.\n\nWhen you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\n\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \"unhealthy\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\n\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot \"fail\" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. \n\nBtw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.\n\nI know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.\n\nF the bikini body, your happiness is more important.

Is it during a specific time of day or after certain activities? Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternative activities to distract yourself, like going for a walk, reading, or picking up a hobby.\n\n2. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to your food, savoring each bite, and eating slowly. It can help you feel more satisfied with less food.\n\n3. **Healthy Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks on hand for when cravings hit. Things like fruits, veggies, or nuts can be satisfying without adding too many calories.\n\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n5. **Meal Planning**: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive eating. Knowing what and when you'll eat can help you stick to your calorie goals.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. Small changes can lead to big results over time. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Eating out of boredom is super common, but there are several practical ways to get a handle on it. First, try to make eating more intentional - sit down at a table without distractions and focus on your food rather than mindlessly snacking. This helps you feel more satisfied with proper meals.\n\nFor managing cravings and leftovers specifically, portion control starts in the kitchen. Store leftovers in individual containers with proper portion sizes right after cooking. Put them toward the back of the fridge and keep cut vegetables or other low-cal snacks front and center for when you want to munch.\n\nThe boredom aspect is key here - you'll want to build a \"menu\" of alternative activities to do instead of eating. Keep your hands busy with a hobby like drawing or crafts, go for a walk, call a friend, or tackle a small task you've been putting off. The urge to eat often passes after 10-15 minutes of doing something else.\n\nDrinking water or herbal tea can also help curb false hunger. Try keeping a large water bottle with you and setting specific meal\/snack times. This creates structure and makes it easier to stick to your calorie goals.\n\nRemember that building new habits takes time. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself as you develop a healthier relationship with food. You've already taken a great first step by recognizing the pattern and seeking solutions.",
    "comment_llama":"Resisting the urge to eat, especially when it's driven by boredom, can be tough. One strategy that might help is to find alternative activities to do when you feel the urge to snack. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing a few jumping jacks, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Sometimes, our brains can mistake boredom for hunger, so giving yourself something else to focus on can help curb unnecessary eating. \n\nAnother approach is to plan out your meals and snacks in advance, including healthy options that fit within your calorie goals. This can help reduce the temptation of leftovers or other high-calorie foods. You might also consider removing or limiting triggers - like keeping leftovers out of sight or finding healthier ways to cope with boredom, such as reading, drawing, or calling a friend.\n\nIt's also worth exploring why you're eating out of boredom. Is there something missing that food is filling? Addressing the underlying issue can make it easier to develop healthier habits. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it's about progress, not perfection. Small steps, like reducing your daily calorie intake gradually or finding one new activity to replace eating out of boredom, can add up over time.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get it, food cravings can be tough! It sounds like you've already identified boredom as a trigger, which is a great first step.\n\nA few things that might help:\n\n*   **Hydration is key:** Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water when a craving hits.\n*   **Find a replacement activity:** Since you mentioned boredom, have a list of go-to activities ready. This could be anything from reading a book, going for a walk, calling a friend, or working on a hobby. The goal is to distract yourself until the craving passes.\n*   **Out of sight, out of mind:** Leftovers are your weakness? Maybe portion them out immediately after a meal into single-serving containers and freeze them, or give some away. Make it harder to mindlessly grab them.\n*   **Plan your meals:** Knowing what you're going to eat and when can help you stick to your calorie goals. Pre-tracking your food in an app can also make you more aware of what you're consuming.\n*   **Don't beat yourself up:** If you slip up, don't throw in the towel. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track with your next meal. Small changes add up over time!\n\nYou've got this! It's a process, so be patient with yourself.\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019d try to differentiate boredom from actual hunger first. If you\u2019re just restless, replace that urge with something else: go for a short walk, do a quick chore, or even sip on water or tea. Planning meals can help too\u2014if you know exactly what and when you\u2019re eating, you\u2019ll be less tempted to mindlessly grab leftovers. Another tweak is focusing on higher-protein or high-fiber foods at each meal since they keep you fuller longer. And if you need to snack, keep lower-calorie options on hand, like fruit or veggie sticks, so you can still indulge without blowing your daily goal. It\u2019s all about giving yourself enough structure and alternative activities so boredom munching isn\u2019t your default.",

This problem made me not think about all the things above, which I basically stopped.\nNext week I will probably go again at my parents home because uni will finish for this period and so I will have 3\/4 months in which I don\u2019t have any idea about what to do, which can help me for the future \/ self-improvement while providing fun.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you've been through a lot, but it's great that you're looking to get back on track. Here are a few ideas to help you make the most of your summer:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small daily or weekly goals. It could be as simple as reading a book, learning a new skill online, or getting back into a fitness routine. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Re-establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily schedule that includes time for exercise, hobbies, and relaxation. Having a routine can provide structure and help you stay focused.\n\n3. **Explore New Hobbies**: Use this time to explore interests you haven't had time for. Whether it's learning a new language, cooking, or picking up an instrument, it can be both fun and fulfilling.\n\n4. **Volunteer**: If jobs and internships are off the table, consider volunteering. It's a great way to gain experience, meet new people, and make a positive impact.\n\n5. **Reflect and Plan**: Take some time to reflect on what you've learned from the past few months and plan for the future. What do you want to achieve in the next year? How can you set yourself up for success?\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. What's important is that you're taking steps to move forward. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, props for recognizing that period wasn't great for you and wanting to make positive changes. That self-awareness is actually a really good starting point.\n\nThose 3-4 months at home can be a perfect reset opportunity. Since you mentioned having success with self-improvement earlier this year, you already know you're capable of it. The key is creating structure and positive momentum.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for your summer: Start with a simple morning routine - maybe 30 mins of exercise (doesn't have to be gym, could be running or bodyweight stuff), followed by 15 mins of planning your day. Pick up a skill that interests you and could be useful later - coding, a language, whatever catches your interest. Set aside specific hours for this daily.\n\nThe job\/internship situation might be tricky timing-wise, but you could use this time to build your resume in other ways - maybe an online certification, personal project, or volunteering. This gives you something concrete to show for your summer while addressing that comparison mindset more productively.\n\nMost importantly, take it one day at a time. You don't need to figure out everything at once. Focus on building consistent, healthy habits first. When September rolls around, you'll be in a much better position to tackle university life with stronger foundations.\n\nRemember that setbacks don't define you - it's how you respond to them that matters. You've already taken the first step by wanting to change course. Now it's just about putting one foot in front of the other.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've been through a tough period, but recognizing the issues and wanting to make a change is a huge step forward. First, congratulations on stopping the behaviors that were holding you back, especially with the health scare - that can be a really wake-up call. Now, with 3-4 months ahead of you, this could be a great opportunity to refocus on your self-improvement journey. Since job hunting and internships might not be viable options right now, why not use this time to revisit your goals and priorities? You could start by setting small, achievable objectives for yourself, like getting back into a gym routine or picking up a new hobby. It's also important to address the underlying issues that led you astray in the first place, such as your inferiority complex - consider journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist to work through these feelings. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the past few months - everyone has setbacks, and it's how you learn from them that matters. Use this time to recharge, reflect, and come back stronger. What do you think is the first step you'll take to get back on track?",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey man, it sounds like you went through a rough patch, but the good news is you're aware of it and want to get back on track. That's the first and biggest step.\n\nSince you have 3-4 months free, this is a great opportunity. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's getting back to the gym consistently. Or maybe it's exploring a new hobby that genuinely interests you, something that isn't tied to external validation.\n\nThink about *why* you fell off track. You mentioned feeling inferior and compulsively looking for a job. Address that underlying feeling. Maybe journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist could help you understand those feelings better.\n\nAs for the summer, consider learning a new skill online. There are tons of free or low-cost courses available. It's productive, engaging, and can boost your confidence. Also, think about volunteering. Helping others can be a great way to get out of your head and feel good about yourself.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about the past.

Try to reintroduce some structure into your daily routine: set a regular wake-up time, schedule a workout you enjoy (even just a simple home workout or runs around the neighborhood), and carve out a bit of time each day for something productive like reading or browsing online courses that match your interests. If you can\u2019t land a summer internship or job, you might look into remote freelance gigs or volunteer opportunities to keep yourself active and focused. The key is to start with easily manageable habits and stick to them, even if they feel trivial. That sense of routine and progress can keep you feeling balanced and motivated to move on to bigger and better things down the line.",

    "post_body":"I have been in a rut for about 6 months now (maybe even more) and I have been doing the bare minimum in everything. I stopped going to the gym and all I do everyday is sit at home, play video games, watch meaningless youtube videos, and succumb to a pornography addiction that I have been trying to fight off for a while now.\n\nI am in my last year of university and need to take a graduate exam to move onto masters and because of this I quit my job to dedicate more hours to studying. This was 3 months ago and I have barely studied at all. And all the hours that I should be using to study are being wasted on the things I mentioned above.\n\nEvery time I make a promise to myself to complete a task or plan out my day to meet certain goals I always end up doing nothing. As a result of this, I stopped believing the promises I make to myself because I'll just end up sitting on the couch doing nothing either way. And even if I go two days while being productive I will always end up relapsing back into my rut on the third day, and if not the third day, then surely the fourth, or fifth, and so on. I can never be consistent at anything. My attention span and focus is probably less than an insect's. I do not respect myself and lack confidence and even if I come forward to talk about my struggles with a friend they never take me serious and ALWAYS misunderstand me.",

How you are gonna tackle every part, be extremely practical and know your limits. Don't put too much expectations and stop planning out things roughly. Being specific will bring more clarity.

Here are a few things you might try to help get out of this rut:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small habit to change. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 10 minutes of study or going for a short walk each day. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Limit your time on video games and YouTube. Use apps or tools to block these distractions during study hours. This can help you focus on what you need to do.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for study, exercise, and relaxation. Consistency can help you regain control over your day.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Find a study buddy or someone you trust to check in with regularly. Sharing your goals with someone else can help keep you accountable.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have setbacks. What's important is getting back on track. Celebrate your small victories and don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as planned.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many people hit similar ruts, especially during important transition periods like preparing for grad school. The good news is that you're aware of the patterns and actively seeking change.\n\nLet's start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE thing to focus on for the next week. Given your grad exam priority, I'd suggest starting with studying. Set a ridiculously easy goal - like studying for just 25 minutes each morning. That's it. Don't worry about the gym or other habits yet.\n\nThe key is rebuilding trust with yourself through small wins. When you consistently hit that 25-minute target, you'll start believing in your own promises again. Use the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. During those 25 minutes, put your phone in another room and block distracting websites.\n\nFor the gaming and YouTube habits - don't try to quit cold turkey. Instead, make them rewards. After completing your study session, give yourself permission to play for a set amount of time. This helps break the cycle of guilt and creates positive reinforcement.\n\nRegarding consistency - forget about perfect streaks. If you miss a day, just pick up where you left off the next morning. Think of it like GPS navigation - when you take a wrong turn, it doesn't berate you, it just recalculates the route.\n\nConsider finding an accountability partner - maybe another student preparing for grad exams. Sometimes external accountability can help bridge the gap while rebuilding self-trust.\n\nRemember: progress isn't linear. Focus on taking small, consistent steps rather than massive changes. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging the situation and seeking help. Now it's time for that 25-minute study session.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and struggling to break out of some negative patterns. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well, so kudos to you for recognizing your issues and seeking help. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as studying for 10 minutes, or going for a short walk outside. The idea is to build momentum and start to rebuild your sense of self-efficacy.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that consistency is not an all-or-nothing thing. Just because you have a setback on the third or fourth day doesn't mean you've failed. It means you're human, and you're going to have ups and downs. The key is to learn from those setbacks and keep moving forward.\n\nIn terms of your studying, you might find it helpful to create a schedule and stick to it, at least for a few hours a day. Break your study sessions into smaller chunks, and take regular breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing. This can help make the process feel less overwhelming.\n\nLastly, don't give up on talking to friends about your struggles. It's possible that they're not taking you seriously because they don't understand what you're going through, but that doesn't mean you should stop reaching out. You might consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and supportive space to discuss your issues.\n\nRemember, getting out of a rut takes time, effort, and patience.

It's super common to feel this way, especially with the pressure of grad school looming.\n\nFirst, be kind to yourself. You're not alone in struggling with consistency. Instead of aiming for huge changes, try micro-wins. Seriously, tiny steps. Like, instead of \"study for 8 hours,\" aim for 15 minutes. Set a timer, no distractions. When it goes off, you're done. You can always do another 15 later if you feel up to it. The goal is to break the inertia.\n\nRegarding the other habits, try replacing instead of just stopping. If you're reaching for the video games, have a book or a quick workout ready to go instead. Even just 10 push-ups can shift your focus. For the pornography addiction, there are some great subreddits and resources out there (I can't link them here, but a quick search will find them) that offer support and strategies.\n\nAs for your friends not taking you seriously, that's frustrating. Maybe try framing it differently, like \"Hey, I'm really trying to make some changes, and I'd appreciate it if you could just listen without judgment.\" If they still don't get it, maybe find a study buddy or online community where people are working towards similar goals.\n\nThe key is to build momentum with small, achievable goals.

The key is to make it easier for your morning self to succeed rather than relying on willpower alone.\n\nFirst, work backwards from your wake time to set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep. Your body clock needs regularity to adapt. Even on weekends, try not to deviate by more than an hour.\n\nPut your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. The moment your feet hit the floor, immediately walk to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face. This combination of movement and sensation helps shake off the grogginess.\n\nWhat helped me was having a specific reason to get up early - something more compelling than just \"I should.\" Maybe it's hitting the gym when it's empty, enjoying a peaceful breakfast, or getting a head start on work. Whatever motivates you.\n\nAlso, make your bedroom a wake-up friendly environment. Get a sunrise alarm clock or put your lights on a timer. The gradual increase in light helps your body transition naturally from sleep. Keep the room slightly cool too - it's harder to get up when you're cozy and warm.\n\nRemember that the first week will be the hardest.

Once you understand the root cause, you can develop a plan to address it. For example, if you're not a morning person, try setting a goal that's rewarding to you, like enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or doing some stretching exercises. It's also important to create an environment that supports your goals, such as placing your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

If you're trying to jump from 6 hours of sleep to 8 and wake up super early, your body will fight you. Gradual adjustments are key.\n\nSecond, what's the *very first* thing you need to do when you get up? Don't think about the whole day, just that first action. Maybe it's drinking a glass of water you left by your bed, or putting on your workout clothes. Make it something small and easy to accomplish.\n\nThird, consider the alarm itself.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's awesome that you're taking steps to understand yourself better and seeking help. That's a huge part of building discipline. With your new ADHD diagnosis, it's great that you're starting medication and therapy, which can really help with focus and routine.\n\nFor building structure, try starting small. Pick one or two things to focus on each day, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating a specific time for studying. Use tools like planners or apps to keep track of your tasks and appointments. Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can make them feel less overwhelming.\n\nSince you're in the UK and sunlight can be scarce, consider using a light therapy lamp to help regulate your sleep and mood. Also, keep nurturing your social connections and hobbies, as they can provide a sense of balance and joy.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. Progress isn't always linear, and being kind to yourself is crucial. You're on the right path, and with time, you'll find a routine that works for you. Keep going, and never hesitate to reach out for support when you need it!",
    "comment_claude":"Congrats on getting your ADHD diagnosis - that's a huge step and explains so much of what you've been experiencing. It's great that you're starting medication soon and already seeing benefits from CBT therapy. Those are really positive developments.\n\nSince you're still working on building structure with your new understanding of how your brain works, here are some ADHD-friendly suggestions:\n\nStart super small with routines - pick just ONE consistent wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends. Your body clock needs that consistency. Use your phone's bedtime mode to help enforce this.\n\nBreak tasks into tiny chunks. Instead of \"study for 3 hours\", try \"read one page\" or \"write one paragraph.\" The momentum often carries you further, but the small initial commitment makes it less overwhelming.\n\nExternal accountability helps a lot - study groups, gym buddies, regular check-ins with friends. When motivation is variable (thanks ADHD!), having others expecting you helps bridge those gaps.\n\nMost importantly - be patient with yourself as you figure out what works for YOUR brain. Some traditional productivity advice won't fit, and that's okay. Keep experimenting with different tools and systems until you find your groove.\n\nThe fact that you pursued answers and got help shows amazing self-advocacy. You've already made huge progress - now it's just fine-tuning with your new understanding of how your mind works.",
    "comment_llama":"It's amazing how far you've come in acknowledging your struggles and seeking help - that takes a lot of courage. Now that you've been diagnosed with ADHD, it's great that you're starting medication and CBT therapy, which can really help with structure and discipline. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small and create a daily routine that works for you, taking into account your ADHD. Break down your day into manageable chunks, and prioritize tasks that are important to you, like attending university, spending time with friends, and self-care activities like going to the gym. You can also try using tools like planners, reminders, or apps to help stay organized and on track.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to have setbacks - it's not about being \"disciplined\" enough, but about finding systems and strategies that work for you. With your ADHD diagnosis, you might need to experiment with different techniques to find what helps you stay focused and motivated. \n\nRemember to be kind to yourself throughout this process, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've already made significant progress, and it's great that you're sharing your story to help others who may be struggling. Keep moving forward, and don't give up hope - you got this!",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's awesome that you've already taken steps like seeking counseling and reconnecting with friends. That's huge!\n\nIt's really common to struggle with structure when you go from a highly structured environment like school to the freedom of university. Don't beat yourself up too much about it.\n\nSince you're already aware of the cycle you fall into, maybe try focusing on small, manageable changes. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, pick one thing to work on each week. For example, week one could be \"get sunlight every day,\" even if it's just sitting by a window for 15 minutes. Week two could be \"attend at least one class,\" and so on.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned your ED, make sure you're prioritizing your mental and physical health. Work closely with your counselor on strategies for managing those tough days. Maybe having a pre-planned meal schedule or a list of healthy snacks readily available could help prevent those bad eating habits from creeping back in.\n\nFinally, remember that discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about showing up for yourself even when you don't feel like it. Be kind to yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward. You've got this!\n\nEDIT: Wow, that's amazing news about your ADHD diagnosis! It's so validating to finally understand what's been going on. It's totally understandable that you were hard on yourself before, but now you can approach things with a new perspective and strategies that actually work for you. CBT therapy and medication can be game-changers. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you. So glad things are improving!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It sounds like you\u2019ve already made huge strides by seeking a diagnosis, starting therapy, and working out a plan with medication. One practical way to build on that is to create small daily check-ins for yourself at consistent times. It could be as simple as setting an alarm in the morning to remind you of your top three goals for the day, then another alarm at night to briefly see how it went. That rhythm can help you stay aware of where you stand, even if ADHD makes it tough to keep focus. Another idea is to schedule your most important tasks when your medication\u2019s effects are strongest so you\u2019re not fighting your own brain chemistry. You can also reward yourself for those tasks you complete\u2014a small treat, a moment on social media, anything to make the process feel more positive. Over time, those small wins build motivation, and you\u2019ll start trusting your ability to handle bigger goals without waiting for someone to force you. It may not be perfect every day, but showing up for yourself consistently, even in small doses, is what really cements discipline. Good luck, and keep going\u2014you\u2019re doing better than you think.",

After grouping, dedicate time and effort to things which you can change while learning to accept the things you can't.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Finding a balance between indulging in distractions and dealing with anxiety can be tough, but it's definitely possible with some small steps. Start by setting aside a short, dedicated time each day to be device-free. Use this time to engage in activities that are calming but still engaging, like reading a book, drawing, or going for a walk. This can help ease you into being comfortable with your thoughts without overwhelming anxiety. Also, consider practicing mindfulness or meditation for a few minutes daily. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and reduce anxiety over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be patient with yourself as you work towards finding that middle ground.",
    "comment_claude":"What you're describing is actually a common challenge - the contrast between constant stimulation and sitting with our thoughts. The good news is that you can gradually build tolerance for both focused attention and managing anxiety.\n\nStart by creating small pockets of device-free time, maybe 10-15 minutes at first. During these periods, try simple activities like taking a walk, doing a puzzle, or reading a physical book. These give your mind something concrete to focus on while stepping away from high-dopamine activities.\n\nFor managing anxious thoughts, consider starting a basic mindfulness practice. The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety but to observe thoughts without getting caught up in them. Even 5 minutes of focusing on your breathing can help build this skill.\n\nYou might also benefit from having a \"worry time\" - set aside 15 minutes daily to actively process your concerns. Write them down, consider solutions, then move on. When anxious thoughts pop up outside this time, remind yourself you'll address them during the designated period.\n\nRemember that both extremes - constant stimulation and overwhelming anxiety - are learned responses that can be gradually adjusted. Take small steps, be patient with yourself, and celebrate progress along the way. Building a more balanced relationship with both stimulation and stillness takes time, but it's absolutely achievable.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're caught between two extremes, and finding a balance is key. One strategy could be to start small by setting aside device-free time in short intervals, like 10-15 minutes a day, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. During this time, try to focus on a single, calming activity, such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or a short walk. This can help your mind adjust to not relying on dopamine-inducing activities for comfort. Additionally, consider exploring stress management techniques, like mindfulness meditation or yoga, which can help you develop coping mechanisms for anxiety. It's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to take things at your own pace and not expect to overhaul your habits overnight. By taking tiny steps towards finding this middle ground, you can work on building resilience and developing a more mature mindset that can handle stress in a healthier way.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough when you feel stuck between instant gratification and overwhelming anxiety. It sounds like you're looking for a way to build resilience and find a healthier balance.\n\nOne thing that might help is to start small with facing those anxious thoughts. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Maybe dedicate just 5-10 minutes a day to sitting with your thoughts, without judgment. You could even try journaling \u2013 writing them down can sometimes take the edge off.\n\nAs for the dopamine hits, try replacing them gradually instead of cutting them out cold turkey. If you spend hours on social media, try reducing it by 15 minutes each day and replacing that time with something slightly more productive or relaxing, like reading or a short walk. The key is to make the alternative appealing enough that you don't feel like you're depriving yourself.\n\nBuilding discipline is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and don't beat yourself up for slip-ups. They're part of the process. You got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"One approach is to start slowly easing the gap between screen time and full-on anxiety. Tiny steps help; for example, set a short timer (like 15 minutes) to do something mildly productive or relaxing that\u2019s not scrolling on your phone\u2014maybe reading a few pages of a book, going for a brief walk, or doing a mindful breathing exercise. Spending small chunks of time away from your devices can build your tolerance for discomfort and help you practice handling anxious thoughts in manageable doses. Gradually increase those chunks as you get more comfortable. You don\u2019t have to force yourself into long, unstructured breaks right away; just aim to build the habit of tolerating a little stress without defaulting to instant dopamine hits. Over time, you\u2019ll likely find that balance comes more naturally, and you\u2019ll start feeling more in control of your schedule and thoughts.",

I also tend to sleep on my bed the weekends without doing my chores. I feel I tend to be more productive during my weekdays even though I have less time compared to my weekends. Hanging out with friends to late night during the weekends is also another reason why my sleep cycle is disturbed.",
    "comment_best_human":"One thing you might experiment with is taking one day completely off to rest, and the other day schedule something for 9 or 10am outside of the house, like a breakfast with a friend, so you have to get up and get ready for the day.

If those activities in some way contribute to helping you recharge from your week, why not see them as valuable? Then you are removing the feeling that that time is 'wasted'. Your life isn't lacking discipline at the weekend, it's just that you do different things at the weekend and haven't accounted for them in your schedule.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Weekends can definitely throw off your routine, but there are a few strategies you might find helpful. First, try setting a loose schedule for your weekends, similar to your weekdays, but with more flexibility. This can help you maintain some structure without feeling too restricted. Consider setting a specific wake-up time and a few key tasks you want to accomplish each day. \n\nAlso, think about setting limits on activities that tend to derail your plans, like watching porn or staying out late. You could try setting a timer or using apps that help limit screen time. For social activities, maybe plan them earlier in the day or set a time to head home so you can still get a good night's sleep.\n\nLastly, it might help to identify one or two things you really want to achieve over the weekend and focus on those. This way, you can still enjoy your downtime but also feel productive. Remember, it's all about balance and finding what works best for you. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"It's totally normal for discipline to slip on weekends - the lack of external structure can make it challenging. The key is creating your own weekend routine that's both productive and enjoyable, rather than falling into a cycle of late nights and oversleeping.\n\nStart by setting a consistent weekend wake-up time that's reasonable - maybe 1-2 hours later than your weekday time. This helps maintain your circadian rhythm while still giving you some extra rest. Having a fixed wake-up time, even after going out with friends, will naturally encourage you to wrap up nights earlier.\n\nFor the porn habit, try replacing that Friday night routine with something else enjoyable but less disruptive to your sleep - maybe watching a movie, reading, or doing a hobby you enjoy. The goal isn't to make weekends as rigid as weekdays, but to find a middle ground.\n\nConsider scheduling your most important weekend tasks for Saturday morning when you typically have more energy. Even just 2-3 hours of focused work then leaves you plenty of time for relaxation and socializing later. You might find it helpful to make a short list on Friday afternoon of 2-3 priority tasks for the weekend.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being productive 24\/7. It's okay to relax and have fun on weekends - the goal is finding a sustainable balance that leaves you feeling good rather than regretful come Monday morning.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a common phenomenon - the weekend slump. One strategy that might help is to set some clear boundaries and goals for your weekends, just as you do for your weekdays. This could be as simple as deciding on a few non-negotiable tasks you want to complete, like doing your chores or tackling one important project, and scheduling them into your weekend plan. \n\nIt's also worth considering why you feel the need to unwind in ways that derail your routine, such as watching porn or staying up late. Are there other ways you could relax and recharge that wouldn't disrupt your sleep cycle and productivity? For example, you could try reading a book, taking a walk, or practicing some gentle stretches before bed.\n\nAnother approach might be to create a \"stop doing\" list for your weekends - things you're going to intentionally avoid, like sleeping in too late or getting sucked into screens before bed. And when it comes to socializing with friends, could you find ways to do that during the day or early evening, so it doesn't interfere with your sleep schedule? \n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take breaks and have some downtime on the weekends - you don't have to be productive every waking moment. But by finding a balance between rest and responsibility, you might be able to create a more sustainable and disciplined routine that carries over into your weekdays.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get it. Weekends can be a discipline black hole!

Just one! This helps maintain momentum. It could be something small, like laundry or meal prepping for the week.\n\nSecond, the Friday night thing is a big trigger. Maybe try replacing the porn habit with something else you enjoy that's less draining. Could be reading, a hobby, or even just going for a walk. The key is to consciously choose an alternative.\n\nThird, with the late nights with friends, try suggesting earlier meetups or activities that don't revolve around staying out super late. Maybe brunch instead of late-night drinks? Or a daytime activity like hiking or a museum visit?\n\nFinally, remember that slip-ups happen. Don't beat yourself up if you have a bad weekend.

    "comment_o1":"It might help to build a simple weekend routine that still feels relaxing but stays structured enough to keep you on track.

Also, consider not letting your weekend start with a late-night binge\u2014set a reminder on your phone to shut down screens by a certain hour.

Here's a simple approach that might help: start small. Pick one tiny habit to focus on, something so easy you can't say no. It could be as simple as drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning or taking a 5-minute walk. The key is consistency, not intensity. \n\nOnce you get comfortable with that, gradually add more small habits. This builds momentum and confidence. Also, try to be kind to yourself. It's normal to have setbacks, but what's important is getting back on track. Reflect on what truly matters to you and why you want to change. This can help you find motivation and direction. Remember, growth is a journey, not a destination. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First, know that feeling stuck and overwhelmed is a common human experience - you're not alone in this struggle. The fact that you're reaching out shows you haven't given up, even if it feels that way.\n\nStart incredibly small. Forget about massive life changes for now. Pick ONE tiny action you can do today - maybe making your bed, drinking a glass of water, or stepping outside for 2 minutes. The action itself matters less than building the tiniest sense of momentum.\n\nThe key is to prove to yourself that you can do something, anything, different from your current pattern. Your brain is currently wired to resist change because staying in the comfort zone feels safer. But each small win starts rewiring those neural pathways.\n\nWhen you complete that tiny action, really let yourself feel good about it. Don't dismiss it as too small or meaningless. You're building evidence that you can take action, even when it's hard.\n\nTomorrow, do that same tiny thing again. Once it starts feeling automatic (might take days or weeks), add one more small action. The compound effect of these minimal changes will start shifting your mindset naturally.\n\nFor the emotional side - try this: When you notice yourself feeling like a victim, pause and ask \"What's one microscopic thing within my control right now?\" Then do that thing. Control builds through action, not the other way around.\n\nRemember: You don't need to figure everything out at once. Just focus on proving to yourself that you're capable of small changes.

    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so kudos to you for reaching out and seeking help. It's clear that you want to make changes, but you're not sure where to start. One thing that might be helpful is to focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps towards growth. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and take a single, tiny action towards it. For example, if you want to start exercising, your first step might be as simple as putting on your workout clothes or doing one push-up. It's not about achieving some kind of grand transformation overnight, but about building momentum and developing a sense of control and agency over your life. As for changing your mindset, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge some of the negative self-talk that's holding you back. Instead of beating yourself up over your perceived weaknesses, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. Remember that personal growth is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, just a willingness to show up and take that first step.",

It's totally understandable to feel that way.\n\nInstead of trying to tackle everything at once, what if you started with *one tiny thing*? Seriously, something so small it feels almost ridiculous. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up. The point isn't the task itself, but the feeling of accomplishment you get from actually *doing* something.\n\nThat little win can create a tiny ripple effect. Once you've consistently done that one small thing for a week or two, add another. Maybe it's going for a 10-minute walk. Again, keep it small and manageable.\n\nAs for feeling like a victim, that's a tough one. A lot of times, that comes from focusing on what you *can't* control. Try shifting your focus to what you *can* control \u2013 your actions, your reactions, your choices in this very moment. Even if it's just choosing to get out of bed instead of staying there.\n\nFinding your values is a longer process, but you can start by paying attention to what makes you feel angry or inspired. What injustices bother you? What kind of people do you admire? Those clues can point you in the right direction.\n\nAnd finally, about fear... everyone's afraid of something. The key is to not let fear dictate your life. Start by identifying your biggest fear, then break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What's the smallest thing you can do to confront that fear, even just a little bit?\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate the small victories, and remember that even tiny steps forward are still progress. You got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"Sometimes the key is lowering the bar until you can start with something very small and manageable.

If you slip up, don\u2019t treat it like a total reset. Just keep going from where you left off. Over time, you\u2019ll learn that you can build strength, purpose, and a life you choose by stacking small wins.

Here are a few more ideas that might help you get closer to that 100% success rate:\n\n1. **Sleep Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is optimized for sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, blackout curtains, and a cool room temperature. Sometimes small tweaks can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Consistent Wind-Down Routine**: You mentioned reading before bed, which is great. Try to keep your wind-down routine consistent every night to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n3. **Light Exposure**: In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. This can help reset your internal clock and make waking up easier. If natural light isn't an option, consider a light therapy lamp.\n\n4. **Alarm Variety**: Since Alarmy worked well for you, maybe try varying the types of puzzles or challenges it offers. This can keep your brain engaged and prevent you from getting too used to the same routine.\n\n5. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Incorporating a short mindfulness or meditation practice before bed can help improve sleep quality, making it easier to wake up.\n\nRemember, perfection isn't always necessary, and even a 70% success rate is a solid foundation. Keep experimenting with small changes, and you'll likely find what works best for you. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"You're already doing a lot of great things with your evening routine! Getting to 70% consistency is actually impressive. For that final 30%, here are some additional strategies that could help:\n\nFirst, track the mornings when you don't wake up successfully. Look for patterns - is it happening more on certain days of the week? After particular activities the day before? This data can help you identify and address specific triggers.\n\nSince Alarmy worked well for you, consider combining it with a smart bulb or sunrise alarm clock. These gradually brighten your room before your alarm time, helping your body wake up more naturally. The light + puzzle combination can be really effective.\n\nAlso, while your sleep schedule is good, you might experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier. Sometimes we need a bit more sleep than we think, and that extra buffer can make morning wake-ups easier.\n\nOne last suggestion: create a small reward system for your first few minutes awake. Maybe it's a favorite podcast you only listen to during your morning routine, or a breakfast you really look forward to. Having something enjoyable right after waking can help train your brain to get up more willingly.\n\nKeep building on what's working - you're definitely on the right track with your current habits. Small tweaks to an already solid foundation can make a big difference.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've already established a solid morning routine and have tried several strategies to improve your wake-up consistency. To help boost that 70% success rate to 100%, I'd suggest exploring a few additional tactics. Have you considered exposing yourself to natural light as soon as your alarm goes off? This can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make it easier to wake up. You could also try making your morning routine more enjoyable, such as listening to music or doing some light stretching - this might give you something to look forward to and make it easier to get out of bed. Additionally, you might want to experiment with a \"stop doing\" list, where you identify any habits or activities that might be sabotaging your sleep or making it harder to wake up, such as scrolling through your phone before bed or consuming heavy meals too close to bedtime. It's also worth considering whether there are any underlying issues, such as sleep quality or stress, that might be affecting your ability to wake up consistently. The Alarmy app seems like a great tool, so you might want to keep using that and see if you can combine it with some of these other strategies to get to 100%.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, that's a really solid routine you've already built! Getting to 70% is a great accomplishment. Here are a few ideas to nudge you closer to 100%:\n\nFirst, since you're already using Alarmy and it worked well, maybe experiment with different puzzle types or difficulty levels within the app. Keep it challenging enough that you're actually awake when you solve it.\n\nSecond, consider *why* you're failing the other 30% of the time. Are you hitting snooze without realizing it? Are you genuinely still exhausted? If it's exhaustion, maybe slightly adjust your bedtime earlier, even by just 15 minutes. If it's the snooze button, try putting your phone and alarm clock even FURTHER away, like in a different room entirely. Make it a real chore to turn them off.\n\nThird, think about adding a reward system. If you wake up on time for a full week, treat yourself to something you enjoy (a special breakfast, a new book, etc.). Positive reinforcement can be surprisingly effective.\n\nFinally, and this might sound counterintuitive, but don't beat yourself up too much about the occasional slip-up. It happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Consistency is key, but perfection is the enemy of good. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"You might try shifting your bedtime earlier just a bit, since running five or six days a week can increase your need for sleep. Even half an hour more can make a big difference in feeling fully rested when your alarm goes off. Another idea is to let in as much morning light as possible\u2014open curtains or use a sunrise lamp if it's still dark at 6 a.m. And if you can find an accountability partner or coworker who also wakes up early, agreeing to check in with each other can give you that extra push to stay consistent and hit 100%. Good luck, and keep experimenting with what works best for your body and schedule.",

    "post_body":"I\u2019m destroyed my life\n\nI\u2019m 23 now and I\u2019ve destroyed my life. I got out of college and went to a party school right out of high school(I had no friends in hs and I was a loser) rushed a top ranked sorority and started going out every night( I ended freshman year with a 1.0 gpa) I did better my second year but my parents caught me smoking and made me drop out of college and move home. I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.\nI got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn\u2019t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I\u2019ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I\u2019m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don\u2019t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I\u2019ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy. I have no friends, ive gained a ton of weight and all I do is work and do hw(it\u2019s undergrad hw idk why its so hard for me to complete) and cry. I\u2019m going to graduate soon (maybe) and I have about 30k debt: with the expulsion and the dui, the chances of getting into a masters program or a higher paying job is slim. I have about 30k in student debt and I have no car. If I get a car and insurance it will be 900 a month just insurance, I have no support system and live with my parents who hate me. I work remote and 7 days a week so everyday I wake up to the hellacious nightmare of the same reoccurring day. I want to kill myself, I work a call center job and I\u2019m never going to get out. I\u2019m too old for things to change, everyone has a partner and I lost the only person who cared about me. I tried dating again and it wasn\u2019t the same. I\u2019ve tried making new friends but no one really likes me, I\u2019ve been in therapy for 7 years. Nothing changes, I should end it.",
    "comment_best_human":"I would say the opposite!  Look at all that you've gone through, and come out the other side.  You are strong, resilient, and amazing.  You can do anything that you set your mind to.  So, what are you going to do?  You are living at home.  That's great, that allows you to save money and keep your living expenses as low as possible.  \n\nThat said, I hope you are able to save some money so that you can move out soon.  As for the car situation, not sure how you're getting around now, but you could get a bike, motor assisted bike, or scooter.  All of those would give you much more ability to get around, and possibly some extra exercise, too.",

But I want to remind you that it's never too late to turn things around, and you've already shown a lot of resilience by getting back into school and working hard.\n\nHere are a few steps that might help you regain some control and build a more positive routine:\n\n1. **Focus on Small Wins**: You've already made progress by passing your classes and working two jobs. Celebrate those victories, no matter how small they seem. They show your capability to change and improve.\n\n2. **Set Manageable Goals**: Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable goals. This can make your workload feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.\n\n3. **Establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily routine that includes time for self-care, even if it's just a short walk or a few minutes of meditation. Consistency can help bring some stability to your life.\n\n4. **Reach Out for Support**: It sounds like therapy hasn't been as helpful as you'd like, but don't give up on finding support. Consider looking for support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Guidance**: If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or a hotline. They can provide immediate support and help you find a path forward.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for the support you deserve.",
    "comment_claude":"First off - you're 23, not 83. Your life is absolutely not over and you've already shown incredible resilience by making positive changes. Getting sober, maintaining two jobs, and pulling your grades up to As and Bs is seriously impressive. Those aren't small achievements.\n\nThe past few years have clearly been rough, but you're already doing the hard work of turning things around. Focus on what you can control right now: finishing your degree, staying sober, and maintaining your improved academic performance. These are the building blocks for everything else.\n\nAbout the job situation - call centers aren't forever. Once you graduate, you'll have more options. Your DUI and academic history don't define your entire future. Many employers care more about recent performance and what you can do for them now. Keep building a solid work history and focus on developing marketable skills in your current roles.\n\nFor the immediate financial challenges: Look into income-based repayment plans for your student loans. For transportation, consider public transit or carpooling temporarily while you build up savings. $900\/month for insurance is rough - that should decrease over time with a clean driving record.\n\nMaking friends as an adult takes time and consistent effort. Consider joining some hobby-based groups or volunteering - it's easier to connect with people when you're focused on shared interests or goals rather than just trying to \"make friends.\"\n\nYou've already proven you can make positive changes when you commit to them. Keep building on that momentum. Take it one day at a time, and remember that your current situation is temporary. You're not too old for anything - you're just getting started.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've been through an incredibly tough time, and it's amazing that you're still pushing forward despite all the challenges you've faced. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and hopeless - it doesn't mean you are hopeless, though. You've already shown resilience by getting back on track with your studies, stopping drinking, and working hard to support yourself.\n\nIt might be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to tackle everything at once, focus on one thing at a time. For example, you could start by finding ways to make your daily routine more bearable, like taking short breaks during the day or finding a hobby that brings you some joy. You've also mentioned therapy, which is great - it might be worth discussing these feelings of hopelessness with your therapist to see if there are any new strategies or perspectives they can offer.\n\nRegarding your debt and job prospects, it's true that having a DUI and expulsion on your record can make things tougher, but it's not impossible to overcome. You could look into speaking with a financial advisor about managing your debt, and consider reaching out to your university's career services for help with finding job opportunities or preparing for graduate school.\n\nAs for feeling like you're too old for things to change, that's just not true. People make significant changes in their lives at all ages, and it's never too late to start building a more fulfilling life. It might be helpful to try to connect with others who have been through similar experiences - there are many online communities and support groups where you can find people who understand what you're going through.\n\nLastly, please don't give up. You've made it through some incredibly tough times already, and that's something to be proud of. If you're feeling like you're in crisis, there are resources available to help - the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24\/7 at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or you can text the Crisis Text Line at 741741. You don't have to go through this alone.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, that sounds like a really tough journey, and it's understandable you're feeling overwhelmed. It takes serious strength to keep going after facing so many setbacks, so give yourself credit for making it this far.\n\nFirst, please know that there are resources available if you're feeling suicidal. You can call or text 988 in the US and Canada to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or dial 111 in the UK. There are people who want to help you through this.\n\nIt sounds like you're already building some discipline by working two jobs and focusing on school. That's huge! Maybe try breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of thinking about the mountain of debt or the lack of a car, focus on one small win each day. Could be finishing one homework assignment, applying for one scholarship, or even just going for a short walk. Small wins build momentum.\n\nRegarding the job situation, start exploring options even if it feels impossible right now. Update your resume, practice interview questions, and look for entry-level positions in fields that interest you, even if they seem out of reach. You might be surprised at what's available. Networking can also open doors, so try connecting with people in your field on LinkedIn or at industry events (even virtual ones).\n\nAs for the social isolation, it's tough to rebuild a support system. Maybe try joining a club or group related to your interests, even if it's online. Focus on being present and engaging in the activity, rather than putting pressure on yourself to make friends instantly.\n\nIt's also worth revisiting your therapy and discussing how to make it more effective. Maybe a different approach or therapist could provide a fresh perspective. Don't be afraid to advocate for your needs and explore different options.\n\nYou're not too old for things to change. You're only 23, and you have so much time ahead of you. Focus on building a life you're proud of, one small step at a time. You've got this.\n",

Try to keep that momentum going with small, consistent steps each day. Even just having a regular wake-up time, blocking out time for schoolwork, and removing temptations (like deleting your ex\u2019s number or social media) can help you focus on what matters. It might feel isolating to only do school and work, but consider looking for smaller, low-pressure ways to connect with new people at your university or online communities. You don\u2019t need a big circle to find friends who care. Finally, you might want to keep up therapy or other forms of professional help alongside your routine changes. It won\u2019t be magic overnight, but each little disciplined habit adds up. You\u2019ve managed to bounce back this far\u2014don\u2019t underestimate your ability to keep going.",

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking for advice. That takes courage. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-esteem and social anxiety, and there are ways to work through it.\n\nStart small. Pick one thing you want to improve and focus on that. For example, if it's social skills, try setting a goal to have a short conversation with someone each day, even if it's just a simple \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" It might feel awkward at first, but practice helps.\n\nFor ADHD, consider breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Use tools like timers or apps to help with time management. It can also be helpful to write things down to keep track of what you need to do.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be introverted. You don't have to be the life of the party to be successful or happy. Embrace who you are and focus on your strengths. Maybe look for jobs that align with your interests and where being introverted is an asset.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself.

    "comment_claude":"Hey there. The way you're feeling right now is rough, but it's not permanent and it's not beyond repair. Let's break this down into manageable pieces.\n\nFirst, having ADHD means your brain works differently - not worse, just different. Many successful people have ADHD and have found ways to work with it rather than against it. Instead of trying to force yourself to be good at multitasking, lean into your ability to hyperfocus. Find roles that let you tackle one thing at a time.\n\nStart small. Really small. Pick one tiny skill you'd like to improve and practice it for just 5 minutes a day. Maybe it's making small talk with the grocery store cashier, or reading about a topic that interests you. The goal isn't to become an expert - it's just to prove to yourself that you can grow.\n\nFor job hunting, try looking for positions that play to your strengths rather than forcing yourself into roles that drain you. Introverts can excel in many careers - data analysis, writing, programming, research, skilled trades - where the focus is on your work rather than constant social interaction. \n\nStop comparing yourself to others - they're running a different race with different starting points. Instead, compare yourself to where you were yesterday. Even tiny improvements count.\n\nThe fact that you feel better when you're confident shows that your personality isn't the problem - your self-talk is. Work on building small wins that you can look back on. Keep a \"wins journal\" where you write down one thing you did well each day, no matter how small.\n\nYou've already shown courage by reaching out for advice. That's a win right there. Build on that momentum, one tiny step at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're really struggling with some tough feelings about yourself, and it's making it hard for you to see a path forward in your career. One thing that might be helpful is to try to separate your self-worth from your job prospects. Instead of thinking \"I'm not good enough to do this job,\" try to focus on what specific skills or tasks you're interested in and see if there are any jobs that align with those. You don't have to be the most outgoing or charismatic person to succeed - many jobs value quiet, detail-oriented workers, for example. \n\nIt might also be helpful to start small and build up your confidence gradually. Instead of looking at big, intimidating jobs like being a trivia host, what are some smaller steps you could take to get more experience and build your skills? Could you try volunteering or taking on a part-time job in a low-stakes environment? This could help you get a feel for what you're capable of and start to build up your self-esteem. \n\nLastly, it's worth remembering that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparing yourself to others is often not very helpful. Instead of focusing on what you think you're lacking, try to focus on what you do bring to the table - your unique perspective, skills, and experiences. And don't forget that ADHD is a legitimate condition that can affect people's lives in many ways - it's not something to be ashamed of, and there are many successful people with ADHD who have learned to work with their strengths and challenges.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not beyond repair. A lot of what you're describing is a cycle, and discipline can be a tool to break it.\n\nFirst, about the job thing: instead of focusing on dream jobs that feel impossible right now, what about aiming for something small and manageable? Think about skills you *want* to develop, not just what you think you're already good at (or not good at). Even a part-time gig where you interact with a few people could be a starting point. The goal isn't to be perfect, it's to get some experience and build confidence.\n\nRegarding the self-loathing, that's a bigger beast, but discipline can help there too. Start small. Really small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire personality, pick ONE tiny thing you want to improve. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. The key is consistency. When you start proving to yourself that you *can* stick to something, even something small, it builds momentum.\n\nAlso, comparison is the thief of joy. Seriously. Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger those feelings. Focus on your own progress, not someone else's highlight reel.\n\nFinally, for the ADHD stuff, have you explored strategies specifically for managing it? There are tons of resources out there, from apps to organizational techniques. Finding what works for you can make a huge difference in managing time and focus.\n\nIt's not going to be an overnight fix, but small, consistent steps can lead to big changes.

Plenty of steady, well-paid roles need people who are thorough, focused, and able to work independently\u2014traits that introverts with ADHD can excel at, especially once they get their routines in place. Consider testing out different paths in small steps: take a temp gig or volunteer somewhere for just a few hours a week. That can build real-world experience and give you a sense of where you might fit without fully committing. Also, small daily habits like using a reminder app or writing out short to-do lists can help with time management and reduce the stress of forgetting things. Each small win you collect is a step toward seeing yourself in a more positive light. It\u2019s natural to doubt yourself, but it doesn\u2019t have to rule you\u2014focus on these tiny steps, and you\u2019ll start feeling more prepared for bigger challenges down the line.",

Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Focus on Protein and Fiber**: These nutrients can help you feel fuller for longer. Try incorporating more beans, lentils, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or tofu into your meals.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day, and try having a glass before meals to help with satiety.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Slow down and really savor your food. Eating more slowly can give your body time to register fullness. Try putting your fork down between bites or chewing more thoroughly.\n\n4. **Volume Eating**: Add more low-calorie, high-volume foods like vegetables to your meals.

    "comment_claude":"There are several effective ways to feel more satisfied while eating the same amount or less. First, try eating more protein-rich foods and fiber in your meals - these help with satiety much more than simple carbs. Add eggs to breakfast, lean meats to lunch\/dinner, and include vegetables with every meal.\n\nDrinking water before and during meals can help too. Sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger. A glass of water 15-20 minutes before eating can make a real difference.\n\nThe speed at which you eat matters a lot. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness signals. Try putting your fork down between bites and chewing thoroughly. This gives your body time to recognize it's getting full.\n\nConsider the composition of your meals too. Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados, nuts, olive oil) can help you feel fuller longer. Complex carbs like brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes are more filling than their refined counterparts.\n\nLastly, mindful eating helps - no TV or phone while eating. Focus on your food and you'll likely feel more satisfied with your portions. These aren't quick fixes, but implementing even a couple of these strategies should help you feel more satisfied without increasing portion sizes or food costs.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're looking to increase satiety without necessarily changing your overall diet or calorie intake. One thing you might consider is focusing on more filling foods, such as those high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. These nutrients tend to be more satisfying and can help keep you feeling fuller for longer. For example, adding some nuts or seeds to your meals, or incorporating more lean proteins like chicken or fish, could make a difference. Additionally, drinking water before and during meals can also help with feelings of fullness. Another strategy is to slow down while eating and pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues - sometimes our brains can take a bit to catch up with our stomachs, so giving yourself time to feel satisfied can be helpful. You might also experiment with different spices and seasonings to make your meals more flavorful, which can help you feel more satisfied with the same amount of food. Lastly, considering your budget constraints, planning your meals and snacks in advance could help you make the most of what you have and reduce the need for extra purchases. Have you tried any of these approaches or is there something specific that's holding you back from feeling full after meals?",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get where you're coming from. Feeling hungry all the time when you're trying to budget sucks. It's definitely doable to feel fuller without drastically changing your diet or aiming for weight loss.\n\nA couple of things to try: First, focus on fiber and protein. These take longer to digest and can really help with satiety. Think about adding a side of beans to your lunch or dinner, or maybe swapping white bread for whole wheat. Even a handful of nuts as a snack could make a difference.\n\nSecond, water is your friend. Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water before your meals and see if that helps curb your appetite. Also, make sure you're drinking enough throughout the day.\n\nThird, mindful eating can be surprisingly effective. Slow down, put your fork down between bites, and really focus on the taste and texture of your food. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to register that you're full, so eating slower gives it a chance to catch up.\n\nFinally, consider the volume of your food. You can increase the volume of your meals without adding a ton of calories by incorporating things like leafy greens or broth-based soups. A big salad before your main course could help you feel more satisfied with a smaller portion of the main dish. Good luck!\n",

Drinking water or unsweetened tea before or during meals can also help; sometimes thirst feels like hunger. Sticking to a meal schedule and pre-planning what you\u2019ll eat can help you develop a habit of stopping once you\u2019ve hit your portion limits, even if your mind says \u201cgrab more.\u201d Over time, sticking to that plan gets easier, and your stomach can adjust so you feel satisfied with the new normal.",

    "post_body":"I am a student who is preparing for competitive exams. I make a routine and there is a duration for everything that a will study on a day. \nI have a big alarm clock that makes super loud noise. I installed an alarm app (alarmy) that cannot be snoozed or turned off unless I complete some math tests on the app. I tie my phone to my wrist because the vibration from alarm can wake me up. My sleep time is adequate. Yet, I fail everyday. \nThe clcok? I just pushed the alarm button to \"off\".\nThe alarm app? Since it cannot be turned off, I switch off or even pull battery from my phone. I go back to sleep. \nHere is something more infuriating. My brother leaves home early in the morning and I leave my bed to go and lock the door after he leaves. Yet, I instead of washing my face with water, I go back to my bed and go back to sleep. The desire to sleep at that moment is so strong that no logic works in my mind. \nWhen I had job, I used to wake up on my own and even didn't need any alarm. The face of my ex-boss and fear of losing job made me wake up automatically. \nNow there is no fear in me when I wake up and then I go back to sleep. What an asshole I am. \nAt this moment, I don't have a job but to get a job i need to ace in the competitive exams. So, I am studying hard all day but almost everyday I fail to complete my expected amount of study because I lose 3 to 4 hours in late rising in morning. Not to mention, when I wake up late and start to study late on my routine, I feel so angry. I hate myself on that moment and promise myself that it won't happen next day but unfortunately this has been going on for a long time. The desire to sleep more ruins my entire day. \nPlease someone help me with suggestions. How can I stop myself from falling back to sleep? \nPS: My sleep is healthy and adequate. I just skip stufy and sleep.",
    "comment_best_human":"The idea of forcing yourself to \"just get up\" is ignoring the real possibility of a biological issue. \n\nIf it's consistently difficult to wake up, then it may be more than laziness, and there could be a lot that's keeping you from getting good sleep. \n\nThere is a ton you can do to improve sleep, but rather than listen to random people on reddit, you should check out [this podcast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nm1TxQj9IsQ). This guy is a real scientist and one of the best channels for anyone in this sub.\n\nAlso, if you're not familiar with Biohacking, it's a whole can of worms, but [here is a bio hackers guide to sleep](https:\/\/shop.biohackercenter.com\/products\/biohackers-handbook-sleep-e-book) (free e-book)\n\nI've done as much of this as possible, and now I wake up before 7AM every day with no alarm. \n\nMake sure you get a blood test to ensure you dont have nutrient deficiencies, and focus on eating healthy overall. But after that, the biggest things that helped me were;\n\n1. Going to bed at the *same time* consistently, even on weekends. Along with allowing at least 8-9 hours before I have to be up.\n\n2. Light therapy. I got a smart light that dims and shifts to a warmer color at night, and very slowly comes back on when it's time to wake up, as well as avoiding screens right before bed.\n\n3. Sleeping in complete darkness, and a slightly cooler temperature.\n\n4. Exercise during the day! \n\n5. Don't eat within a few hours before bed.\n\n6. Getting a decent bed and pillow that work for my body type.\n\nEveryone is different, so put in the time to experiment and see what right for you.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're really committed to making a change, which is a great first step. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Create a Morning Ritual**: Since you used to wake up for your job, try to recreate that sense of urgency. Set a small task that you have to do immediately after waking up, like making your bed or doing a quick stretch. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to start the day.\n\n2. **Accountability Partner**: Find a friend or family member who can check in with you in the morning. Sometimes knowing someone else is counting on you can be a powerful motivator.\n\n3. **Gradual Change**: If waking up early is too big of a leap, try adjusting your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day. This can make the transition smoother and less daunting.\n\n4. **Reward System**: Give yourself a small reward for waking up on time. It could be something simple like enjoying a favorite breakfast or a few minutes of a hobby you love.\n\n5. **Reflect on Your Why**: Remind yourself why these exams are important to you. Visualize the benefits of passing them and how it will impact your future. This can help reignite that internal motivation.\n\nRemember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"It sounds like you've tried the technical solutions (alarms, apps, etc.) but the core issue is that sleepy-you is really good at sabotaging awake-you's plans. This is super common - your brain is excellent at finding loopholes when it wants more sleep!\n\nSince external motivation (like your old job) worked well before, let's create some immediate consequences for your morning routine. Here are a few approaches that have worked for others:\n\nGet an accountability partner. Tell your brother before he leaves that you'll send him a photo of yourself at your study desk by X time. If you don't, you owe him money or have to do his chores. Make the stakes real but reasonable.\n\nPut your alarm clock\/phone across the room by your study materials. When you get up to turn it off, immediately sit at your desk and start your first task. Don't give yourself time to debate or rationalize - make it one fluid motion from alarm to studying.\n\nCreate a \"morning score\" system. Give yourself points for getting up on time and starting study by your target time. Lose points for oversleeping. Set weekly goals and reward yourself when you hit them (maybe with something you really want).\n\nThe key is breaking that moment where you decide to go back to bed. Once you're vertical and moving, stay that way. Splash cold water on your face, drink some water, do a few jumping jacks - whatever it takes to get past those crucial first few minutes when your sleepy brain is trying to talk you into \"just 5 more minutes.\"\n\nRemember: You don't have to feel motivated or energetic. You just have to not get back in bed. Start there, and build on small wins.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've tried some creative methods to wake yourself up, but you're still struggling to stick to your routine. One thing that might be worth exploring is identifying the underlying reasons why you're having such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. You mentioned that when you had a job, the fear of losing it was a strong motivator for you to wake up on time. Now that you don't have that external pressure, you might need to find an internal motivation to replace it.\n\nSince you're studying for competitive exams, you could try to remind yourself why waking up early is important for your goals. Write down your reasons for wanting to ace these exams and post them somewhere visible, like on your bedroom wall or fridge. This might help you connect with your motivations and give you a sense of purpose when your alarm goes off.\n\nIn terms of practical strategies, you could try making a plan for the first 10-15 minutes after you wake up that doesn't involve going back to bed. For example, you could make yourself a cup of coffee or tea, do some light stretching, or simply sit outside for a few minutes to get some fresh air. Having a small goal to achieve right away might help you build momentum and make it easier to stick to your routine.\n\nIt's also worth considering the environment you're waking up in. You mentioned that you leave your bed to lock the door after your brother leaves, but then you go back to bed. Could you try making your bedroom a space that's less conducive to sleeping? For example, you could open your curtains to let in natural light, or move your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's clear that you're frustrated with your current situation, but beating yourself up over it isn't going to help. Instead, try to focus on making small improvements each day and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they might seem. Good luck!",
    "comment_gemini":"Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've got the motivation to study, but your brain is playing tricks on you in the morning. It's super frustrating when you know what you *should* be doing, but you just can't seem to make it happen.\n\nIt seems like you're relying heavily on external motivators (alarms, etc.), but those are easy to defeat when you're half-asleep. Maybe try shifting your focus to internal motivation. You mentioned the fear of your ex-boss got you up. Can you tap into that feeling of responsibility or consequence, but apply it to your studies? Think about *why* you want to ace these exams. Visualize the positive outcome \u2013 the job, the financial security, the feeling of accomplishment. Really connect with that feeling before you go to bed.\n\nAlso, instead of just trying to brute force yourself awake, try making the morning more appealing. What if you prepped a really delicious breakfast the night before? Or had a favorite podcast or audiobook ready to go? Something you actually *look forward* to.\n\nAnother thing: maybe your study schedule is too rigid. If you're constantly failing to meet your goals, it can be demoralizing. Could you make it a little more flexible, so a late start doesn't completely derail your day? Even just shifting things around so the most important tasks are first thing might help.\n\nFinally, don't beat yourself up so much. Everyone slips up. The important thing is to learn from it and keep trying. Maybe keep a journal and track what works and what doesn't. You've got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"You might try creating a quick morning \u201cmission\u201d that forces you to stay up once you\u2019re on your feet. For example, place your alarm somewhere you actually have to walk to, and then do something active right away, like splashing water on your face or doing a few squats to get your blood flowing. It may sound simple, but that immediate physical activity can break the drowsiness that tempts you back to bed. If you can, add an external commitment in the early morning\u2014like a quick phone call with a friend, a study buddy session, or even a brief walk with someone else\u2014so there\u2019s a sense of urgency and accountability. Lastly, try to remind yourself that you\u2019ve done it before: your ability to wake up for work came from having a real consequence in mind. See if you can recreate that sense of seriousness now by defining your own stakes (maybe missing study time means postponing career goals), and reinforce it daily so you don\u2019t give in to that morning fog.",

Working from home is definitely a different beast that requires adjusting your approach.\n\nHere's what's worked for me when dealing with similar WFH struggles:\n\nStart small - pick ONE task first thing in the morning. Not the biggest or scariest one, just something manageable. Complete it before checking emails or messages. This builds momentum for the day.\n\nSet up a proper workspace if you haven't already. Having a dedicated spot just for work helps your brain switch into \"work mode\" versus being in relaxation spaces.\n\nUse the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Don't worry about perfect productivity. Even if you only get 15 good minutes out of each session, that's progress.\n\nFor the backlog of messages and tasks - tackle them in scheduled blocks. Set aside specific times (like 10-11am for emails) rather than letting them loom over you all day.\n\nThe fact that you know you're capable of doing these tasks is huge. Your skills haven't disappeared - you're just adjusting to a new work environment. Take it one task at a time, celebrate small wins, and rebuild that momentum gradually.\n\nYour Sunday productivity and making that checklist are awesome first steps.

It's great that you recognize the problem and want to fix it!\n\nFirst, HUGE congrats on the productive Sunday and making that checklist! That's a massive step in the right direction. Seriously, celebrate that win.\n\nNow, for keeping the momentum going:\n\n*   **Break it down even further:** That checklist is awesome, but if tasks still feel overwhelming, break them into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps. Instead of \"Write report,\" try \"Open report document\" or \"Write the title of the report.\" Seriously. The goal is to make the initial action so easy you can't say no. Once you've started, it's much easier to keep going.\n*   **Timeboxing is your friend:** You've already started with the timing on your checklist, which is great. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break). Knowing you only have to focus for 25 minutes can make a huge difference. During your breaks, *actually* step away from the computer.\n*   **Tackle the avoidance:** You mentioned not wanting to reply to emails. Pick *one* email you've been avoiding and just reply to it. Even a short \"Got it, will get back to you soon\" is better than nothing. Get that small win under your belt.\n*   **Environment matters:** Since you're working from home, try to create a dedicated workspace. Even if it's just a corner of a room, make it a place that's specifically for work. This can help mentally separate work from relaxation.\n*   **Be kind to yourself:** You're not going to be perfect every day. There will be setbacks. Don't beat yourself up about it.

I left my extremely toxic job in March and have bounced around dead end jobs since then.

Here are a few things that might help:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It\u2019s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one small habit to change first.

You're not alone in this struggle, and it's never too late to start building better habits.\n\nStarting with the weed - you're right that this needs to be addressed. Cannabis can seriously impact motivation and make everything feel more difficult than it needs to be. Consider checking out r\/leaves for support in cutting back or quitting.\n\nHere's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start incredibly small.

Do that one small thing every single day for two weeks. Don't worry about anything else yet. Once that becomes automatic, add one more small habit. \n\nFor school specifically - set up your class materials the night before. Put everything by the door. Make it as brain-dead simple as possible to get to class, because when you're struggling with motivation, every tiny obstacle becomes a mountain.\n\nYou mentioned being exhausted with yourself - use that energy.

You can start with that first until you\u2019re finally comfortable and confident enough to go and workout in a gym. Just take your time and don\u2019t pressure yourself.",
    "comment_10th_human":"Which is worse, your health scare or maybe someone judging you?\n\nPut your earphones in, and take care of you. People there will be less judgmental than you think, they are usually glad to see you take the initiative and take control of your problems.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle. It\u2019s not easy, but you\u2019re already making progress by changing your diet and using the equipment you have at home. When it comes to the gym, remember that everyone is there for the same reason: to improve themselves. Most people are focused on their own workouts and not on others. If the gym still feels intimidating, maybe start by going during off-peak hours when it\u2019s less crowded. You could also try group classes or find a workout buddy to make it more fun and less daunting. \n\nAs for motivation, setting small, achievable goals can help. Celebrate the little victories, like completing a workout or resisting a craving. Over time, these small wins build up and boost your confidence. And remember, it\u2019s okay to have off days. What matters is getting back on track. Keep pushing forward, and you\u2019ll find your rhythm. You got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off, congrats on taking those initial steps with your diet and having home exercise equipment - that's already more than many people start with. \n\nAbout the gym anxiety - this is super common, even among regular gym-goers. Here's what helped many others push through it: Most people at the gym are completely focused on their own workouts and progress. They're not judging others because they're too busy thinking about their own form, sets, or what they're going to do next.\n\nFor building confidence, try going during off-peak hours at first (usually early morning or late evening). This gives you space to get comfortable with the environment and equipment. You might also want to book a session with a trainer - they can show you proper form and help create a workout plan that matches your current fitness level.\n\nAs for staying consistent with both diet and exercise, external motivation is helpful but building habits is what really makes it stick. Start small - maybe commit to just 15 minutes at the gym three times a week. Once that becomes routine, gradually increase it. Same goes for diet - you're already cutting processed foods, which is great. Take it one small change at a time.\n\nRemember that everyone at the gym started somewhere, and you have just as much right to be there working on your health as anyone else. The hardest part is walking through those doors the first few times - it gets easier with each visit.",
    "comment_llama":"It's great that you're taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle, especially after your health scare - that takes a lot of courage. Starting with diet changes is a good foundation, and now adding exercise is the next logical step. I totally get why going to the gym might be intimidating, especially when you're self-conscious about your appearance. Here's what might help: instead of focusing on how you look, try to focus on why you're there - to improve your health and feel better. Remember, everyone at the gym is there for their own reasons, and most people are too caught up in their own workouts to pay attention to others. You could also consider starting with small, manageable goals, like going to the gym at off-peak hours or finding a workout buddy who shares similar goals. Having a supportive community can make a big difference in staying motivated. As for your cravings, it might be helpful to find healthy alternatives that satisfy your cravings, so you don't feel deprived. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just get back on track and keep moving forward. You've already made some great progress with your diet, and with time and patience, you can develop a consistent workout routine that works for you.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, congrats on making the decision to prioritize your health! That's a huge first step. It's totally understandable to feel anxious about the gym, especially when you're feeling self-conscious.\n\nSince you have equipment at home, maybe start by setting really small, achievable goals. Like, \"I'll walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes\" or \"I'll do a 15-minute spin bike session\" three times a week. The key is consistency, not intensity, at first. Once you've built that habit, you can gradually increase the time or intensity.\n\nFor the gym anxiety, could you try going during off-peak hours when it's less crowded? Or maybe find a friend to go with you for support? Another option is to focus on learning a specific exercise routine beforehand so you feel more confident when you're there. There are tons of free workout videos online.\n\nRegarding cravings, try to identify what triggers them. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know the trigger, you can find healthier ways to cope. Also, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Small changes add up over time! You got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"Going to the gym can definitely feel intimidating, but most people there are focused on their own workouts and aren\u2019t paying much attention to others. You could try going at off-peak hours or bring a friend for moral support. Even short workouts at home add up, so keep using that treadmill and spin bike on the days you don\u2019t feel like leaving the house. If cravings for junk food come up, try replacing them with healthier swaps instead of cutting everything out at once. Small, consistent steps build discipline over time, and it\u2019s totally normal to make gradual progress. You\u2019ve got this.",

    "post_body":"I\u2019m an incredibly thin-skinned person when it comes to any sort of criticism. The second I hear any kind of criticism from a parent, professor, friend, or acquaintance, I feel incredibly deflated and my entire day is ruined. I think part of this comes from wanting to be liked by people and hating that people see something in me worth criticizing. But I want to change. Any advice on developing a more resilient attitude to criticism?",
    "comment_best_human":"You need to grow your self confidence.\n\nIn my case. I studied some philosophy.\n\nAlso, you need to be smart to take this criticism like a good sign. Cuz if they have some critics about you, actually you need to think why are they doing this?\n\nIf you feel like you are doing things ok and you know who you are and have a clear goal and objectives that are aligned with your perspective of life, moral and ethics. \n\nThen there is a big chance that they only are making criticism about themselves. Cuz are ppl out there that doesn't have a little of confidence to achieve that you are achieving. Or actually envy your actual position or anything that you are doing. \n\nYou need to be able to identify which critics actually are good for you. Be humble, and accept the critics that can be an improvement for you. Be smart, think about this critics like only information that comes to you. You decide to use it in the way you need. Don't waste good information but if the info comes with hate or trash words, just don't waste your time arguing or being mad, don't auto sabotage your mind.\n\nIn all of the cases that I mentioned critics are so good because if ppl are talking shit or want to demotivate you. It is sign that you are doing things ok. If they are good, the critics are constructive cuz they want you to be better. But in the other hand if they are bad, the critics are trash cuz they envy you and don't want you to success. \n\nBut always listen, and take advantage of information.\n\nMost of ppl actually don't want others to grow and have success in life cuz in that way they feel less bad.\n\nKeep going.",
    "comment_10th_human":"Write down all the things you think are worth criticizing. Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much everything. Don\u2019t take yourself so seriously.",
    "comment_gpt4":"One way to develop a thicker skin is to reframe how you view criticism. Instead of seeing it as a personal attack, try to see it as an opportunity for growth. When someone criticizes you, ask yourself if there's any truth to what they're saying and how you can use it to improve. It might help to remind yourself that everyone has room for improvement and that criticism is a part of learning and growing. Also, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of being human. Over time, this mindset shift can help you become more resilient to criticism. Lastly, consider setting small goals to expose yourself to constructive feedback regularly, like asking a trusted friend for their honest opinion on something specific. This can help you gradually build up your tolerance and learn to handle criticism more effectively.",
    "comment_claude":"Learning to handle criticism better is a skill that can definitely be developed with practice. One effective approach is to start viewing criticism as valuable feedback for growth rather than a personal attack. When someone offers criticism, try to pause and ask yourself \"What can I learn from this?\" instead of immediately feeling defensive.\n\nA practical exercise you can try: The next time you receive criticism, write it down word-for-word and wait 24 hours before reflecting on it. This cooling-off period helps separate the emotional reaction from the actual content of the feedback. You'll often find that what felt devastating in the moment looks much more manageable the next day.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that receiving criticism usually means you're putting yourself out there and trying things - that's something to be proud of. Even the most successful people face regular criticism. The difference is they've learned to filter it: take what's useful, discard what isn't, and keep moving forward.\n\nStart small. Maybe practice with minor critiques from people you trust, and gradually work your way up to handling tougher feedback. Over time, you'll build that mental muscle of resilience, just like any other skill.\n\nRemember: someone taking the time to give you feedback often means they see potential in you and want to help you improve. That's actually a compliment in disguise.",
    "comment_llama":"Developing thicker skin to criticism is definitely achievable with practice and the right mindset. One strategy you could try is to separate your self-worth from the criticism itself - remember that just because someone criticizes one aspect of your work or behavior, it doesn't define your entire worth as a person. It might also help to reframe criticism as an opportunity for growth and improvement, rather than as a personal attack. When you receive criticism, try to focus on the specific issue being addressed and what you can learn from it, rather than taking it as a reflection of your overall character. Additionally, consider seeking out constructive feedback from people you trust, which can help you build resilience and develop a more nuanced understanding of how to use criticism to your advantage. It's also important to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone receives criticism at some point - it's how you respond to it that matters. By gradually exposing yourself to constructive criticism and working on your self-perception, you can build up your resilience over time and develop a more confident attitude towards feedback.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Criticism stings! One thing that's helped me is to try and reframe how I see it. Instead of viewing criticism as a personal attack, try to see it as data. Is there something useful in what they're saying, even if the delivery isn't perfect?\n\nAnother thing is to actively seek feedback in small doses. Ask a friend or professor for specific feedback on a project or presentation. This helps you get used to hearing critiques and allows you to practice responding constructively.\n\nAlso, remember that not all criticism is valid. Sometimes people are projecting their own insecurities or just having a bad day. Learn to discern between constructive criticism and just plain negativity. If it's not helpful or accurate, let it roll off your back. It takes practice, but you can definitely build up that resilience!\n",
    "comment_o1":"One approach is to remind yourself that feedback doesn\u2019t define who you are as a whole; it\u2019s just someone else\u2019s perspective on a specific aspect of your work or behavior. Try to identify any useful takeaways, then let go of the parts that aren\u2019t constructive. It helps to pause for a moment before reacting\u2014or even journal if it really stings\u2014so you can process it more objectively. Over time, you\u2019ll build resilience by seeing mistakes and negative feedback as normal parts of growth. It also helps to accept that not everyone will like you, and that\u2019s okay. What matters most is taking what you can learn, making improvements where possible, and then moving forward without dwelling. This kind of consistent focus on learning rather than self-judgment can gradually make criticism feel less personal.",

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It's great that you're aware of the issue and looking to make a change. Here are a few steps that might help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Identify Triggers**: Try to figure out what situations or emotions lead you to reach for junk food. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know your triggers, you can work on addressing them directly.\n\n2. **Healthy Alternatives**: Stock up on healthier snacks that you enjoy. If you have a sweet tooth, try fruits like berries or apples. Sometimes just having a healthier option available can make a big difference.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to the taste, texture, and satisfaction of your food. It can help you enjoy your meals more and reduce the urge to snack mindlessly.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try setting small, achievable goals. For example, limit yourself to a certain amount of chocolate per week and gradually reduce it.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Incorporate some physical activity into your routine. It doesn't have to be intense; even a daily walk can help manage cravings and improve your mood.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection.

    "comment_claude":"First off, congrats on reducing your rice portions - that's a real win and shows you can make positive changes. For the chocolate and junk food situation, here's what's worked for many people:\n\nStart by not keeping these foods in your house. It's much easier to say no once at the store than multiple times at home when cravings hit. Replace your current snack stash with healthier alternatives you actually enjoy - maybe fruits, nuts, or dark chocolate if you need that chocolate fix.\n\nWhen cravings hit hard, try the 10-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll wait just 10 minutes before giving in. Often the urge passes, but if it doesn't, you can make a more conscious choice rather than acting on impulse. During those 10 minutes, do something engaging - take a walk, call someone, or work on a hobby.\n\nFor lasting change, track your triggers. Notice what situations or emotions lead to snacking. Are you stressed? Bored? Once you know your patterns, you can develop better responses to those triggers.\n\nRemember this is a gradual process. You've already shown you can change habits with the rice portions. Apply that same patience here - focus on progress, not perfection. Each day you make better choices is a step forward, regardless of any setbacks.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've made some progress with reducing your rice portions, which is great, but now you're facing a new challenge with junk food. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - when and where do you usually reach for chocolates or other junk foods? Is it when you're stressed, bored, or around certain people? Once you're aware of your triggers, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms, like going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or finding healthier snack options. Additionally, try to make your environment work in your favor - get rid of junk food at home, or avoid walking past the candy aisle at the store. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like cutting back on junk food by one serving per day, and gradually work your way up to making healthier choices.

Junk food cravings can be tough, especially when you're already making other changes.\n\nOne thing that might help is to figure out *why* you're reaching for the chocolate. Is it boredom? Stress? A reward? Once you know the trigger, you can find healthier substitutes. For example, if it's boredom, try going for a walk or doing something creative. If it's stress, maybe try some deep breathing exercises or listening to music.\n\nAlso, don't try to cut everything out at once. That usually backfires. Instead, try swapping out one chocolate bar a day for something else, like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts. Gradually reduce the amount of junk food you're eating each week.\n\nAnother thing that works for some people is to make it harder to get the junk food. Don't keep it in the house. If you have to go out of your way to get it, you're less likely to indulge.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're going to slip up sometimes, and that's okay. Just get back on track the next day.

This creates a physical barrier between you and social media first thing in the morning.\n\nThe key is making the desired behavior (getting up and starting your day) easier than the undesired behavior (scrolling). When your phone isn't right next to you, you have to actually get up and walk to it, which gives your brain a chance to wake up and make more intentional decisions.\n\nIf you absolutely must keep your phone as your alarm, try putting it across the room so you have to get up to turn it off.

You can also use app blockers that prevent social media access during certain hours - this adds another barrier between you and the scroll.\n\nRemember that the first few minutes after waking really set the tone for your whole day. Instead of letting social media dictate that tone, take control by establishing a simple morning sequence - maybe just \"alarm off \u2192 bathroom \u2192 water \u2192 stretch\" to start. Keep it super basic at first and build from there once it becomes automatic.",
    "comment_llama":"One strategy you could try is setting your alarm across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off - this way, you're already up and moving before you even touch your phone. Alternatively, you could use an alarm app that has a feature like \"no snooze\" or one that requires you to complete a task before you can check your notifications. As for the doomscrolling itself, try setting a specific goal for your morning routine, like making your bed or brushing your teeth, and challenge yourself to get that done before you're allowed to check social media. It might also be helpful to replace the social media scrolling with something else, like reading a book, meditating, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee - give yourself something better to look forward to in the mornings.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get the doomscrolling struggle. It's a tough habit to break! Here's a couple things that might help:\n\nFirst, the classic: phone across the room. Seriously, if you have to physically get out of bed to turn off the alarm, you're already winning.\n\nSecond, try changing your phone's home screen. Bury those tempting social media apps in a folder on the *last* page. Replace them with something boring but useful, like a calendar or a notes app with your to-do list. Out of sight, out of mind (at least for a few crucial minutes).\n\nThird, and this might sound weird, but try setting a *second* alarm for 15-20 minutes after your first one. Use that first alarm as the \"get out of bed\" alarm, and the second as a backup. Knowing you have a little buffer might reduce the anxiety that leads to scrolling.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important: have a plan for what you *will* do instead of scrolling. \"Go take a shit like a normal person\" is a good start, but maybe add something else right after, like \"drink a glass of water\" or \"stretch for 5 minutes.\" Having a positive alternative makes it way easier to resist the urge to doomscroll. Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019d suggest putting your phone in a spot where you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off, and set a rule for yourself not to open any apps until you\u2019ve finished your bathroom routine or eaten breakfast. If it\u2019s too tempting, consider using a focus or app-blocking mode on your phone in the morning so social media is locked for the first 15\u201330 minutes of your day. This small shift can help break the habit of mindless scrolling and give you a chance to ease into your morning with more intention.",

    "comment_10th_human":"One possible solution is that don't start with some upheaval task or don't try to finish a task at once. Tell yourself that you're gonna spend only 40 mins on this and no more even if you have really gotten into the rythm. This is because it will help your mind to condition it in a way that you'll think no matter how horrible a task is you won't spend more than 40 mins at a time. Do this with pretty much every task. Whether you love or hate it. Allot it 40 mins or any short period of time and don't extend no matter what. \n\nYou said you know you can do better which means you have some level of confidence so sometimes people don't even start just because they think it's just a tough task. So you just need to fight that resistance. A lot of times if you're able to fight that resistance you realise that this task wasn't as tough as you thought it'd be. \n\nAlso fear can drive people. Be fearful and really force your mind to think the consequences so that you can induce a visceral emotion in yourself about the consequences or the embarrassment you might have to face. \n\nAlso have some hobby(small or big doesn't matter) that you can look forward to.

    "comment_claude":"Hey there - I totally get the challenge of balancing housework responsibilities with everything else. The good news is that procrastination and time management are skills we can improve with the right approach.\n\nStart by breaking down your tasks into really small chunks. Instead of \"do assignment,\" try \"write introduction paragraph\" or \"research 3 sources.\" For housework, maybe \"clean kitchen counter\" rather than \"clean kitchen.\" These smaller tasks feel way more manageable.\n\nA technique that might help is the \"2-minute rule\" - if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This builds momentum and prevents small tasks from piling up. For bigger tasks, try working in 25-minute focused blocks (Pomodoro technique), then take a 5-minute break.\n\nSince you mentioned having 1-2 hours of housework, try to establish a consistent time for it. Maybe right after breakfast or before dinner. This creates routine and removes the mental burden of deciding when to do it.\n\nFor deadlines, use a simple calendar or task list (digital or paper) and work backwards. If an assignment is due Friday, mark mini-deadlines: research by Tuesday, rough draft by Wednesday, etc. This prevents that last-minute rush.\n\nRemember - you don't need to transform overnight. Pick one small change to implement this week. Maybe it's the 2-minute rule, or setting mini-deadlines. Build from there. You've already taken the first step by recognizing what needs to change.",

This can help you build momentum and make progress without feeling too overwhelmed. Additionally, you might consider talking to your family about your workload and seeing if there's a way to distribute the housework more evenly, or find ways to make it more efficient so it takes up less of your time.

    "comment_claude":"Hey there - this is a tough situation but it's fixable. The combination of no structure, ADHD, and a completely flipped sleep schedule is creating a nasty cycle, but let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, you need to pick a realistic wake time and stick to it no matter what. Not 4am - that's too aggressive. Maybe start with 11am since that worked better for you before. Get a super loud alarm and put it across the room so you physically have to get up.\n\nThe key is to stay up the entire day after you wake up. No naps. It'll suck for 1-2 days but it's necessary. As soon as you wake up, get outside for at least 15 minutes of sunlight. This helps reset your circadian rhythm. \n\nFor the first few days, take melatonin about 2 hours before your target bedtime (aim for midnight initially). The goal is to gradually move your schedule earlier, not fix it all at once.\n\nTo maintain the schedule, you need some daily structure. Even with online classes, set specific times to watch lectures, do coursework, etc. Put everything in your calendar and treat it like real appointments. This is especially important with ADHD - external structure is your friend.\n\nAbout the lies - people are generally understanding about sleep issues. You don't have to share details, but a simple \"I've been struggling with my sleep schedule and working to fix it\" is better than keeping track of multiple stories.\n\nThe most important thing is to be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. Your body will eventually adjust, but you have to push through those first few difficult days. You've got this - one step at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule and the lies you've been telling to cover it up are adding to your stress. First, let's tackle the sleep issue - with your ADHD, it might be helpful to establish a consistent daily routine that doesn't rely on willpower alone. Consider setting multiple alarms throughout the day to help regulate your wake-up time, and try to get some morning sunlight exposure as soon as you wake up to help reset your circadian rhythms.\n\nSince you've been able to wake up at 8am for work in the past, you might be able to use that as a reference point to start rebuilding your schedule. Try setting a realistic goal, like waking up at 10am or 11am, and gradually adjust it to an earlier time as your body adjusts. It's also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches.\n\nAs for the lies, it might be helpful to start small by being honest with one person you trust about your situation. This can help take some of the weight off your shoulders and give you a sense of accountability. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're not alone in struggling with sleep and ADHD - many people have been in your shoes before.

The important thing is to focus on building a consistent routine.\n\nSince you mentioned ADHD, have you explored strategies specifically for sleep with ADHD? Things like a super consistent bedtime routine (even on weekends), blackout curtains, white noise, and avoiding screens an hour or two before bed can make a difference. Melatonin might help, but definitely talk to your doctor about that, especially given your ADHD.\n\nThe biggest thing is consistency. Even if you have a terrible night, try to wake up at the same time. It sucks at first, but it's key to resetting your circadian rhythm. Maybe aim for a slightly earlier wake time each day, even by 15-30 minutes, until you get closer to a reasonable hour.\n\nAlso, think about light exposure. Get bright light first thing when you wake up (a sunlight lamp can be a lifesaver in winter). And try to avoid bright light in the evening.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself.

I\u2019ve tried to see YouTube videos, googled etc, but I just can\u2019t clean properly. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m like this. I can\u2019t even have guests. I can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m like this.\n\nI know people think I\u2019m just lazy but I\u2019m not. I work, study and take long hikes very often. It\u2019s difficult to describe the feeling I get when I think about cleaning my home. I feel defeated.",
    "comment_best_human":"You're like that because no one has taught you how to clean. We aren't born knowing how to be tidy, we have to learn, so that's not your fault at all. Once you clean your house, It's mostly about maintaining that level through routines. I recommend unf*ck your habitat and the flylady for some simple routine building. \nTo get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it's really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash? You can start by sorting laundry into one place (can be a big corner pile even) to do a load a day until it's done, and a bag of trash on a timer a day. It didn't get messy all in one day, so you won't get it clean that fast either. But by taking small steps it can get better faster than you think. Good luck!",
    "comment_10th_human":"You seriously just described my exact situation. I feel overwhelmed with 3 generations worth of stuff, and I also feel like I need to sell everything I'm able to because I could use the money. But it is so damn overwhelming to even think about throwing away or donating, much less selling. I get so stressed I end up doing nothing, and am miserable every day due to all this stuff taking up my space. It's insanity",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself\u2014cleaning can be overwhelming, especially when you're juggling work, studies, and other activities. Here\u2019s a simple approach that might help:\n\nStart small. Pick one area or room to focus on, like your bedroom or living room. Set a timer for 15-20 minutes and do what you can in that time. This makes it less daunting and helps build momentum. Once you see progress in one area, it can motivate you to tackle others.\n\nCreate a routine. Try to incorporate a few minutes of tidying up into your daily schedule. For example, spend 5 minutes each morning making your bed or clearing surfaces. Consistency is key, and over time, these small habits can make a big difference.\n\nConsider a decluttering session. Sometimes, having too much stuff can make cleaning feel impossible. Go through your things and decide what you really need or love. Donate or discard the rest. Less clutter means less to clean.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's a friend or a professional cleaner, sometimes a little assistance can make a huge difference and teach you new strategies.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there - first off, you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Cleaning can feel really overwhelming when things have piled up, but it's absolutely something you can tackle with the right approach.\n\nStart by breaking it down into small, manageable chunks. Pick one area - like your coffee table or a single counter - and just focus on that. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see what you can get done in that time. When the timer goes off, you can stop if you want to. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue, but knowing you *can* stop makes it less daunting.\n\nFor maintaining cleanliness, the \"two-minute rule\" is super helpful: if something takes less than two minutes (putting clothes in the hamper, washing a dish right after using it), do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from building up into overwhelming piles.\n\nA simple daily routine can make a huge difference:\nMorning: Make your bed, put away dishes from the dish rack\nEvening: 15-minute cleanup, wipe kitchen counters, quick sweep\n\nDon't aim for perfection - aim for \"better than yesterday.\" Some days you might only manage one small task, and that's okay. It's still progress.\n\nConsider getting a few basic organizing tools like storage bins or a hamper for each room. Having designated spots for things makes it easier to maintain order.\n\nRemember: You're not \"lazy\" - you're learning a new skill set. Just like hiking, it takes practice to build up your cleaning habits. Start small, be consistent, and you'll get there.",
    "comment_llama":"It's great that you're acknowledging the issue and wanting to make a change - that's the first step to developing discipline in any area of your life, including cleaning. One strategy that might help is to break down the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire house, try focusing on one room or area at a time. Set a specific goal, like cleaning the kitchen counters or doing a load of laundry, and give yourself a deadline to complete it. This can help build momentum and make the task less daunting. Additionally, consider creating a routine or schedule for cleaning, so it becomes a regular habit rather than something you have to think about constantly. You might also find it helpful to identify the specific feelings or thoughts that hold you back from cleaning - is it the physical effort, the decision fatigue of figuring out where to start, or something else? Once you understand what's holding you back, you can start working on strategies to overcome those obstacles. Remember, developing new habits and discipline takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't give up.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that feeling of being overwhelmed by cleaning. It's definitely not just laziness, and it sounds like you've got a lot on your plate already.\n\nInstead of trying to do a massive clean all at once, maybe try breaking it down into super small, manageable chunks. Like, literally just focus on one drawer or one corner of a room for 15 minutes. Set a timer, and when it goes off, you're done for the day. You might be surprised how much you can accomplish in those little bursts, and it doesn't feel so daunting.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to connect cleaning to something you already enjoy. Listen to a podcast or audiobook while you tidy up. Or, reward yourself with something you like after each short cleaning session.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask for help! Maybe a friend could come over and help you get started, or even just keep you company while you clean. Sometimes having someone else there can make a big difference. Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"Cleaning can feel overwhelming when you\u2019re juggling a busy schedule, so start small and build consistency. Try setting a timer for just 10 or 15 minutes each day and tackle one spot at a time. Do your dishes right after meals so they don\u2019t stack up, and throw in a load of laundry more frequently instead of letting it build. After you finish a small task, you\u2019ll get a little boost of motivation that makes the next one easier. Sticking with this routine helps you form a habit, and over time, your house will stay cleaner without feeling like a huge chore. If you miss a day or two, don\u2019t sweat it\u2014just pick up where you left off and keep going.",

    "post_body":"To keep it simple, I have been struggling with issues of possible ADHD, complete lack of focus, beyond extreme procrastination (leaving everything to the last 2 hours, be it mid-term exams or even simple things like playing a game), this has been increasing and getting worse since the last 3 years, I feel constantly braindead, whenever I want to do something, I feel tired, or I spend 30 minutes to 5 hours circling around on my phone (even though I uninstalled all social media applications) and going deep in my thoughts instead of actually working.  \nI have lost all feelings of fear and completely lost my self-control, my final exams are in 3 months, and I haven't done any work.  \nI keep wasting my time playing videogames of which I get very little enjoyment from because of a complete lack of putting in the effort to actually get better at them.  \nI had very few hobbies, playing some simple musical instruments, and video editing, I had a knack for making things like funny videos such as YTMVPs, and I threw both of those in the trash, the only thing that can bring me joy is my eternal slavery to videogames, which I continue to lather myself in, despite the fact that I no longer find them fun.  \nTrying to fix my issue has only lead to having mood swings and being lost in where to start or what to do.  \nIt's also like my brain is searching for activity, or something to keep itself busy, but only if it has instant gratification\/fun from doing so, I find myself fidgeting and being in a state of mini-euphoria whenever I am doing anything I perceive as \"fun\", but whenever I have to put in effort, it's like I get depressed\/anxious, i've tried everything from the 'Pomodoro' method to straight up locking my computer up in a cellar to avoid distraction, is this just laziness, or borderline mental dysfunction?\n\nAm I hopeless? or is there still a way? please help me, r\/getdisciplined, I have to do something.",

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, you're definitely not hopeless, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and while I'm not a professional, I can offer some tips that might help you get started on a better path.\n\n1. **Small Steps**: Start with tiny, manageable goals. Instead of thinking about studying for hours, aim for just 10-15 minutes. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n2. **Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn't have to be perfect, but having a set time to wake up, study, and relax can help create a sense of normalcy and control.\n\n3. **Breaks and Rewards**: Use breaks as a reward system. After a short study session, give yourself a small reward, like a quick walk or a snack. This can help train your brain to associate effort with positive outcomes.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you've already uninstalled social media, maybe try setting specific times for gaming or phone use. This way, you can enjoy them without them taking over your day.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If possible, talk to someone about how you're feeling. Whether it's a friend, family member, or a counselor, having someone to share your struggles with can be really helpful.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep trying and be kind to yourself in the process. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"From what you've described, this sounds a lot more like potential ADHD than simple laziness. The constant need for stimulation, difficulty with tasks requiring sustained effort, and struggles with executive function are classic signs. Getting properly evaluated by a mental health professional would be a good first step.\n\nBut you're definitely not hopeless. Let's focus on what you can do right now to start turning things around:\n\nFirst, accept that cold turkey approaches like locking away your computer probably won't work long-term. Instead, start incredibly small. Pick ONE 10-minute block each day where you'll study. That's it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast. The goal isn't productivity - it's just building the tiny habit of showing up.\n\nFor gaming, set a strict timer for 1 hour of play. When it goes off, you must do something else for at least 15 minutes before gaming again. This helps break the compulsive cycle while still allowing some enjoyment.\n\nYour brain is clearly crying out for dopamine hits. Give it some through healthier channels - take a 10 minute walk, do 5 pushups, or spend 5 minutes practicing an instrument. These build in natural rewards that aren't as intense as gaming but are more sustainable.\n\nFor the final exams - break everything into absurdly small chunks. Don't think \"study chapter 5.\" Think \"read one page\" or \"do two practice problems.\" String these micro-tasks together and you'll build momentum.\n\nThe key is to stop fighting your brain's need for stimulation and instead work with it. Use timers, frequent breaks, and tiny goals. Build from there. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help - that shows you have the self-awareness and motivation to improve. Take it one tiny step at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough combination of challenges, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. First, let's acknowledge that this doesn't sound like simple laziness - the fact that you've tried various methods to stay on track and are still struggling suggests there may be some underlying issues at play, possibly related to ADHD or other mental health concerns. \n\nGiven your struggles with focus and procrastination, it might be helpful to start small and work on building tiny habits that you can actually stick to. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one thing you want to work on - like studying for your exams or practicing a musical instrument - and commit to doing it for just 5-10 minutes a day. That's it. Don't worry about being productive or achieving some big goal, just focus on showing up and doing the thing for that short amount of time.\n\nIt's also worth considering seeking out professional help, whether that's a therapist or a doctor who can help you explore the possibility of ADHD or other underlying conditions. They may be able to provide you with more targeted strategies and support to help you get back on track.\n\nAs for your hobbies, it might be helpful to try to rekindle some of that old spark - not by feeling like you need to create something perfect, but just by doing the thing for its own sake. So, instead of trying to make a funny video, just mess around with video editing software for a bit and see what happens. You might find that it helps you tap into some of that creative energy and motivation.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself - it's okay to not have everything figured out right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not hopeless, and there is definitely still a way forward. It's just going to take some patience, self-compassion, and experimentation to find what works for you.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not hopeless. It's great that you're reaching out and recognizing the need for change.\n\nFirst, regarding the possible ADHD, it's worth getting a professional assessment. A diagnosis (or ruling it out) can give you clarity and open doors to appropriate strategies and support. Don't self-diagnose, but definitely explore it with a doctor or therapist.\n\nSecond, let's tackle the procrastination and lack of focus. Three months is still enough time to make a difference for your exams. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick *one* subject and commit to studying it for just 15 minutes each day. Seriously, just 15. Use a timer. The goal isn't to master the subject in 15 minutes, it's to break the inertia and build a habit. Once you're consistently doing 15 minutes, gradually increase it.\n\nThird, address the video game issue. Cold turkey might not be sustainable. Instead, try setting strict time limits and only allowing yourself to play *after* you've completed your study goal for the day. Make it a reward, not a default. Also, actively seek out alternative activities. Remember those musical instruments and video editing? Even if you don't feel the \"knack\" right away, force yourself to spend 30 minutes on one of them. The joy might return with practice.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not lazy, you're struggling. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Celebrate small wins. And remember, progress isn't linear. There will be setbacks, but don't let them derail you. Get back on track the next day. You've got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to bring back structure and gradually restart the things you used to enjoy, even if you\u2019re not feeling it at first. Start ridiculously small\u2014like studying for five minutes or picking up that instrument for just a couple of chords\u2014so your brain sees it as doable. Once you commit to five minutes, you\u2019ll often find yourself going longer. Another trick is scheduling your gaming time so you have a clear boundary: you get a block of uninterrupted play after you\u2019ve made genuine progress on your work. It\u2019s also worth getting checked out if you suspect ADHD or something else might be at play, because that can open doors to real solutions. Most importantly, don\u2019t treat a slip-up as the end of the road; treat it like a small detour. If you make a little progress each day, you\u2019ll be surprised at how momentum can build.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, which is totally normal. Breaking out of it can be tough, but here are a few steps that might help. First, try to identify the specific habit or behavior you want to change. Once you have that, set a small, achievable goal related to it. For example, if you're trying to cut down on screen time, start with a 15-minute reduction each day. Next, track your progress. This could be as simple as marking a calendar or using an app. Seeing your progress can be really motivating. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Change takes time, and every small step counts. Keep at it, and you'll get there!",
    "comment_claude":"This is a really common struggle - knowing what you need to change but feeling stuck in patterns that don't serve you. The key is understanding that motivation usually follows action, not the other way around. Start ridiculously small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE tiny change you can make today. Something so small it feels almost laughable.\n\nWant to exercise more? Start with literally 1 minute. Want to read? Read one page. Want to study? Set a 5-minute timer. The point isn't the actual amount - it's about breaking through that initial resistance and building momentum.\n\nWhat helps me is treating it like an experiment rather than a permanent commitment. \"Let me just try this tiny thing for 3 days and see what happens.\" It takes the pressure off and makes it feel more manageable.\n\nThe other crucial piece is making it harder to slack off. If social media is your weakness, delete the apps and only access them through browser. If you procrastinate in bed, put your phone across the room. Create friction for the habits you want to break and remove friction for the ones you want to build.\n\nRemember that change isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, but they're not failures - they're data points helping you understand what works and what doesn't. Start small, be consistent with that tiny change, and build from there. The momentum will come.",
    "comment_llama":"I think what you're describing is a really common phenomenon where we get stuck in a cycle of knowing we should make a change, but not actually taking the steps to do so. One strategy that might help is to start by acknowledging that it's okay to feel this way and that it doesn't mean you're flawed or weak. From there, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're struggling to take action - is it fear of failure, comfort with familiarity, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of what's holding you back, you can start to break down the change you want to make into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, instead of saying \"I'm going to completely overhaul my habits,\" try saying \"today, I'm going to take one small step towards my goal, like doing 10 minutes of exercise or reading for 15 minutes.\" By focusing on tiny, achievable wins, you can start to build momentum and develop the discipline to make larger changes over time. It's also important to be kind to yourself and recognize that setbacks are a normal part of the process - don't give up just because you slip up, but instead learn from the experience and keep moving forward.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like being stuck in a loop. One thing that's helped me is to really break down *why* I'm avoiding the thing I know I should be doing.

Instead of thinking \"I have to do this perfectly,\" think \"I just need to make a start, and it's okay if it's messy.\" If it's overwhelm, break the task down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of \"write a chapter,\" it's \"write one sentence.\" Once you get that first sentence down, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. Feeling bad about not doing something just makes you feel worse and less likely to start. Acknowledge the feeling, but then actively choose to focus on the small step you *can* take right now.

Even if you feel like you\u2019re tricking yourself at first, you\u2019ll prove that you can act when you say you will. Those little promises add up and help you build trust with yourself.

It's frustrating because sometimes I've been working out for a whole month and then I have a week of exams and quizzes so I stop working out to study and then it's so hard for me to get back on track and it takes me from 2-3 weeks to start exercising again :( This has been going on for years and I have never really known what to do. \n\nAny advices would be really appreciated :-)",

Consider scheduling these mini-sessions during breaks or right after a class to make them a regular part of your day. Also, try to view exercise as a way to recharge rather than another task on your to-do list. It might help to set a non-negotiable time for exercise, just like you would for a class or meeting.

    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Med school is incredibly demanding, and it's completely normal for exercise habits to get disrupted during intense periods.\n\nInstead of aiming for perfect consistency, try shifting to a more flexible mindset. During regular weeks, stick to your usual workout routine. But during exam weeks or heavy hospital rotations, scale down rather than stopping completely. Even 5-10 minutes of basic exercises (quick stretching, bodyweight exercises, or a short walk) can maintain the habit without taking away from your studies.\n\nThe key is to have different \"modes\" of exercise:\nRegular mode: Your normal home workouts\nBusy mode: Ultra-short sessions (5-10 min)\nRecovery mode: Light stretching or walking\n\nThis way, you're never fully \"breaking\" the streak - you're just adjusting the intensity based on your current demands. It's much easier to bounce back to regular workouts when you've kept even a minimal routine going.\n\nRemember that some movement is always better than none. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

Don't beat yourself up too much about it.\n\nInstead of aiming for perfect consistency, maybe try focusing on *minimums*. Like, tell yourself \"I'll do *at least* 15 minutes of something, even if it's just stretching or a quick bodyweight circuit\" on those crazy days. It's way easier to convince yourself to do a little bit than a full-blown workout when you're exhausted.

Is there a small window in your day, even on busy days, where you could reliably squeeze something in? Maybe it's before your first class, or during a lunch break.

I know that sounds pathetic but when I need to do something like clean a room, work, whatever I panic and escape into my phone or something else.\u00a0 \n\nI do have a history of depression dating back the past 12 years or so but I honestly think it's gotten better the past few.\u00a0 I rarely have badly depressed days now, think I'm just kind of numb at this point. \n\nI'm making this post because it's beginning to effect those around me as well. Recently my SO made a comment at home (and they never ever make comments like this) about how it would be nice if I could do more than just the dishes once a week at home. I'm sitting here now with the mindset of \"yes! Of course! I'll be better about everything immediately!\" but I know as soon as I'm home ill be so worn out for absolutely no reason and I'll just flop onto a chair or the couch and remain there for the most part until bed.\u00a0 I dont want to be this way but it's like there's this pulling force of laziness and numbness to pressing matters that just pulls me downwards into a spiral of uselessness that's beginning to impact anything and everyone around me.\u00a0 \n\nI shower once\u00a0 or twice a week now. I brush my teeth once a day but honestly I missed it the past 24h.\u00a0 I need help.\u00a0 \n\nSorry this post is so jumbled.\u00a0 I just got down what I could in a moment of clarity.\u00a0",

I live in a constant state of absolute extreme anxiety. I will be late anywhere I go no matter how many hours early I get up. I watch tiktoks and Tedtalks of people doing the shit that seems like fun but I cannot bring myself to do a single thing. It's not just dishes and showering- it's everything. I have nothing to look forward too and no sense of purpose to make me feel like actually trying to enjoy my time. Mindfulness seems to be lost on me the more and more I try it. Life is dull and boring and I've felt as if I was in a prison since I was a very young child. I long for this indescrible feeling yet I don't have any motivation to do anything about it. No passions , no dreams and I don't even know where to start to find them. I can't tell if I feel everything or nothing and it's damaged every single relationship in my life. Too which I reply , 'well I was gonna fuck that up eventually so might as well just take a full day nap on my precious day off. ' \n\nI wish I had advice to give you. If I ever find anything I will be right back here and you will be the very first person to know. If it helps in even the smallest way , you are not alone.

    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task to focus on each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or brushing your teeth twice a day. Small wins can build momentum and help you feel more in control.\n\n2. **Set a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, but having a structure can help reduce decision fatigue and make it easier to get things done.\n\n3. **Limit Phone Time**: Consider setting specific times when you can use your phone, or use apps that limit screen time. This can help reduce distractions and make it easier to focus on tasks.\n\n4. **Energy Levels**: Since you\u2019re feeling tired, it might be worth looking into your diet, hydration, and exercise habits. Sometimes small changes in these areas can boost energy levels.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If you\u2019re comfortable, talk to your SO about how you\u2019re feeling. They might be able to offer support or help you stay accountable.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned a history of depression, it might be helpful to check in with a mental health professional. They can offer guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Hey there - what you're describing sounds really rough, but it's good that you're reaching out and recognizing you want to make changes. The exhaustion + procrastination cycle is brutal, and \"just do it\" isn't helpful advice when you're stuck in that pattern.\n\nFirst, given your history of depression and current symptoms (exhaustion, numbness, hygiene struggles), it would be worth checking in with a doctor. Constant fatigue despite adequate sleep can have medical causes that need addressing.\n\nFor building better habits, start incredibly small. Don't try to transform everything at once. Pick ONE tiny habit - something that takes 2 minutes or less. Maybe it's putting one dish away right after using it, or wiping down one counter before bed. The goal isn't the task itself, but building the \"muscle\" of following through on what you plan to do.\n\nFor work productivity, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5 minute break. Start with just one pomodoro per day. Put your phone in another room during that time. Having a clear start\/stop time makes tasks feel more manageable.\n\nWhen you notice yourself reaching for your phone to escape, pause and take 3 deep breaths. Name what you're feeling (\"I'm feeling overwhelmed about cleaning\"). This creates a tiny gap between impulse and action where you can choose differently.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about willpower - it's about systems and small wins that compound over time. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Focus on small, consistent actions that move you in the right direction.\n\nConsider sharing your goals with your SO and asking for their support. Having someone to be accountable to and celebrate small victories with can make a big difference.\n\nYou can absolutely turn this around. Take it one tiny step at a time.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of motivation, productivity, and possibly some underlying mental health issues that are affecting your daily life. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help, so kudos to you for taking this step.\n\nGiven your history of depression, it's possible that your current state is related to that, even if you feel like you've been doing better lately. The numbness you mentioned can be a symptom of depression, and it might be contributing to your lack of motivation.\n\nRather than trying to tackle everything at once, let's start with small, achievable goals. For example, you could try setting a daily routine that includes some basic self-care activities like showering, brushing your teeth, and getting dressed. These small wins can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore the reasons behind your procrastination and escapism. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving these behaviors, you can start working on strategies to overcome them.\n\nIn terms of your work habits, it might be helpful to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day. This can help make your work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these issues and develop strategies for building motivation and productivity. They can also help you address any underlying mental health concerns that might be contributing to your current state.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to do this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you in getting back on track.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's easy to get stuck in those cycles of avoidance and numbness.\n\nFirst, that feeling of being physically and mentally tired all the time? Definitely worth getting a checkup with a doctor. Rule out any underlying medical issues like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. It could be a simple fix.\n\nSecond, let's break down the \"just do it\" advice, because it's rarely that simple. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on *tiny* wins. Seriously tiny. Like, \"I will stand up and walk to the kitchen\" tiny. Or \"I will brush my teeth *right now*.\" The goal isn't to accomplish a ton, it's to break the inertia and build momentum. Once you're up, maybe you rinse a dish. Maybe you don't. The point is you broke the cycle.\n\nFor work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Work for 25 minutes, *fully focused*, then take a 5-minute break to mess around on your phone. Knowing the break is coming can make those focused bursts more manageable. Track your focused time. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day at first, you'll see progress, and that's motivating.\n\nRegarding your SO's comment, instead of promising a complete turnaround (which sets you up for failure), have an honest conversation. Explain you're struggling and actively working on it. Maybe suggest tackling one small chore together each day. It's less pressure and builds connection.\n\nFinally, about the depression history: even if you feel \"numb\" rather than actively depressed, it's worth talking to a therapist. They can give you tools to manage the avoidance and build healthier coping mechanisms. You've recognized the problem, and that's half the battle. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve been in a similar rut, and one thing that helped was starting ridiculously small. Instead of telling yourself you\u2019ll clean the whole place or work a full day productively, commit to doing just one task for ten minutes, then allow yourself a break. Sometimes that little win breaks the inertia. Another trick is to try a new environment or approach\u2014if you\u2019re stuck at work, get up and walk around for a couple of minutes, or switch to a different seating area so your brain knows it\u2019s \u201cgo time.\u201d At home, put your phone somewhere out of arm\u2019s reach; if it requires more effort to grab it, you\u2019re less likely to slip into doom-scrolling. If you can, try moving your body just a bit each day, like a short walk, to shake off some of the constant tired feeling. Consistency over intensity is key, and even tiny improvements can build momentum. You\u2019ve got this.",

The skill doesn't necessarily have to be a hard skill such as: programming or art.  It can also be softer skills such as project management, or communication.\n\nEither way, developing a skill, is a sure way to help get your ideas moving forward. For example, if you choose to be a very convincing manager\/leader, who can listen to others and take their opinions into consideration, that can be a very valuable skill.  \n\nYou could become great at organization and management.

    "comment_claude":"Hey there - it sounds like you're getting caught up in the gap between having big creative visions and the reality of learning new skills. This is super common, especially with technical skills like programming and 3D modeling.\n\nHere's what's likely happening: You're setting the bar way too high for yourself right at the start. You mentioned wanting to make \"masterpiece animations\" before even finishing the donut tutorial. That's like expecting to write a bestselling novel before learning basic grammar.\n\nThe path forward is to radically lower your expectations for your early work. Instead of trying to create amazing things right away, commit to creating small, probably-terrible things consistently. Set a modest goal like \"I will spend 30 minutes every day working through basic Blender tutorials\" or \"I will complete one simple programming exercise each day.\"\n\nThe key is to make your daily goal so small that it feels almost laughably easy. This builds consistency, which is far more important than intensity when you're starting out. Your only metric for success should be \"Did I show up and put in my 30 minutes today?\"\n\nRemember: Every skilled creator started by making bad stuff. The difference is they kept showing up, day after day, even when the results weren't impressive. Your time to shine will come through consistent small steps, not through waiting for some magical spark of motivation.\n\nPick one skill to focus on first, set tiny daily goals, and commit to showing up for 30 days straight.

However, if you want to take your ideas to the next level and create something tangible, you'll need to focus on building your skills and staying committed to your goals. \n\nInstead of trying to learn everything at once, why not start by picking one area you're interested in, like programming or animation, and set a specific, achievable goal for yourself? For example, you could try to complete a simple project in Blender, like modeling a basic object, within a certain timeframe. This will help you build momentum and confidence, which can be a powerful motivator. \n\nIt's also important to remember that discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it takes time and practice to develop. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results, and try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect. You've already taken the first step by recognizing your weaknesses and seeking help, so that's something to be proud of.

Also, focus on making one small change to your diet, like adding more veggies or cutting back on sugary drinks. Remember, it's not about perfection, but progress. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself along the way. If you can, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can provide support tailored to your situation. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"Breaking the cycle between depression and weight is tough, but it's absolutely possible to make progress on both fronts. The key is to start really small and build momentum gradually.\n\nPick one tiny health-related action you can do today. Maybe it's drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning, or taking a 5-minute walk around your block, or eating one piece of fruit. The specific action matters less than making it so small that it feels doable even on your worst days.\n\nOnce you've done that tiny action consistently for a week or two, add one more small thing. Maybe now you're doing that morning walk plus tracking your food intake, no changes required yet - just tracking. Then maybe you add some basic meal prep on Sundays.\n\nThe goal isn't to transform everything overnight. It's to prove to yourself that you can make positive changes, even when things feel overwhelming. Each small win builds confidence for the next step.\n\nFor managing both weight and depression, getting enough sleep is crucial. Try to establish a consistent bedtime, even if you can't sleep - just lying down at the same time helps regulate your body's rhythms.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear. There will be setbacks, and that's normal. What matters is getting back on track with those small actions, one day at a time. You've already taken a positive step by reaching out for advice - keep building on that momentum.",
    "comment_llama":"Losing weight can be tough, especially when dealing with depression - it's like you're facing two challenges at once. First, consider talking to your doctor or a therapist about your situation, they can offer valuable guidance and support. When it comes to getting started with weight loss, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like taking a short walk each day or doing a few push-ups in the morning. These tiny victories can help build momentum and boost your mood. It might also be helpful to focus on adding healthy habits rather than restricting certain foods - this can make the process feel less overwhelming. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to help.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, that sounds really tough, but it's awesome you're reaching out and wanting to make a change. That's the first step!\n\nIt's a classic cycle, and breaking it takes time and patience. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Start super small. Seriously small. Like, commit to a 5-minute walk each day. That's it. No pressure to do more. The goal is just to build the habit of *doing something*.\n\nOnce that feels manageable, maybe add one healthy meal a day. Again, keep it simple. A piece of fruit instead of a sugary snack, or a slightly smaller portion at dinner.\n\nThe key is consistency, not intensity, especially when you're dealing with depression. Celebrate those small wins. Acknowledge that you showed up for yourself, even if it was just for those 5 minutes.\n\nAlso, if you're not already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and strategies for managing the depression itself, which will make everything else easier. Meds can be a real game changer too, if that's something you're open to exploring with a doctor.\n\nYou got this. One tiny step at a time. Be kind to yourself.\n",
    "comment_o1":"It might help to start with small, manageable goals that don\u2019t feel overwhelming. Even just getting outside for a short walk every day or adding one extra serving of vegetables at dinner can be a comfortable way to build momentum. Consistency is what really matters\u2014try doing something active at the same time each day, whether that\u2019s a walk, a gentle workout video, or stretching before bed. Once you establish a routine, it can gradually lift your mood as you notice small improvements. If your energy is really low some days, just do what you can manage, then pick it back up the next day. Over time, these little habits add up and can help break that cycle of feeling stuck.

    "post_body":"I've been very consistent and disciplined about the past 6 months. Early on, I read articles on preventing burnout and they said I need to eat healthier, drink water, etc. and so I prioritised those things. I also prioritised having a good social life, sleep, having a clean environment etc. But I was still experiencing burnout and I decided to do the bare minimum for a week and my personality had a radical change - I was much calmer, happier and rational. In other words, my burnout decreased significantly. That means it was these healthy things that were causing my burnout. How do I prevent burnout from taking care of myself?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much!",
    "comment_best_human":"I think you may have fallen into the trap of toxic productivity, or the idea that you should be productive all of the time. Applied to self care that would be the idea that you have to always eat healthy, always sleep 8 hours a night, meditate everyday, etc. And those are very important, but you shouldn\u2019t obsess about them. It\u2019s okay to not do those things sometimes. It\u2019s all about balance.",
    "comment_10th_human":"You pay attention to how you feel and what is happening for you in any moment, and you honour that. In my experience rest is the most important form of self care and also the most underrated in a society that is so focused on output. So, build in more time for rest, adjust your expectations of yourself when it comes to how much you want to get done and find ways to get what your body needs that aren\u2019t creating more stress. \n\nSelf care should never be about ticking boxes, it\u2019s about learning to listen to yourself and using that information to determine what you need the most at that time. It could be rest, or social time or saying no to something - you don\u2019t know until you stop and assess where you are right now.\n\nGood luck OP \ud83d\ude0a",
    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you've been doing a lot to take care of yourself, which is awesome, but it\u2019s possible to overdo even the good stuff. Self-care should feel like a break, not another item on your to-do list. Maybe try simplifying your routine and focusing on what truly makes you feel good rather than what you think you should be doing. It\u2019s okay to have days where you just do the basics and give yourself permission to relax. Also, consider mixing in activities that are purely for fun or creativity, without any pressure to achieve something. Balance is key, and sometimes less is more. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!",
    "comment_claude":"It sounds like you might be approaching self-care as another set of tasks to rigidly complete rather than activities that should make you feel better. Self-care shouldn't feel like a burden - it's about finding the right balance that works for you.\n\nTry scaling back to focus on what actually makes you feel good and energized. Not every healthy habit needs to happen every single day. Maybe you feel great after socializing twice a week rather than forcing yourself to go out every night. Or perhaps meal prepping on Sundays works better than cooking fresh daily.\n\nStart by picking 2-3 core habits that give you the most benefit and make those non-negotiable. Then treat the others as \"nice to haves\" that you can flex around your energy levels. The goal is sustainable progress, not perfection.\n\nRemember that rest and downtime are also forms of self-care. If taking a week to do the bare minimum helped you feel better, that's valuable information. Consider building regular \"low power mode\" days into your routine where you deliberately dial things back. This isn't failing at self-care - it's actually listening to what your body and mind need.\n\nThe best self-care routine is one you can maintain long-term without burning out. Keep what works, modify or drop what doesn't, and be willing to adjust as needed.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you've stumbled upon a really interesting insight - that sometimes, even good habits can contribute to burnout if they become too overwhelming or rigid. One potential approach could be to re-evaluate your self-care routine and see if there are any areas where you can scale back or make things more flexible. For example, instead of feeling like you need to cook a healthy meal every night, maybe you could aim for 3-4 nights a week and give yourself permission to have something simpler the other nights. Similarly, you might consider prioritizing the self-care activities that bring you the most joy and relaxation, and letting go of any that feel more like obligations. By finding a better balance and being kinder to yourself, you may be able to reduce your risk of burnout while still taking care of your physical and emotional needs.",

It sounds like you've been super dedicated, which is awesome, but also highlights a key point: self-care isn't one-size-fits-all.\n\nIt seems like you might have been overdoing it, turning self-care into another set of rigid rules. The goal is to *reduce* stress, not add to it. Maybe you were trying to optimize everything at once, which can be exhausting in itself.\n\nInstead of a blanket approach, try experimenting to find what *actually* recharges you. Maybe a super clean environment is less important than, say, 15 minutes of reading a fun book. Or maybe forcing a social life when you need alone time is draining.\n\nThink about what truly relaxes you and makes you feel good, and then prioritize *those* things. Also, consider that your needs might change over time. What works now might not work in a few months, so be open to adjusting your routine. It's about finding a sustainable balance, not achieving some perfect ideal of \"healthy living.\" Good luck!\n",
    "comment_o1":"It sounds like your \u201chealthy\u201d routines turned into a strict to-do list rather than things you genuinely enjoy. One way to avoid burnout is to loosen the rigidity and let yourself be flexible.

Maybe keep the ones that leave you truly feeling good\u2014like a shorter walk instead of a full workout\u2014or let yourself occasionally skip something if you\u2019re low on energy. Balancing discipline with a little freedom helps keep these habits sustainable and keeps them from becoming exhausting chores.

This can help you gauge your interest and build some foundational skills without a huge commitment.\n\n2. **Explore Your Passions**: Since you love animals, maybe look into volunteering at a shelter or working part-time at a pet store. This could give you a sense of fulfillment and help you decide if you want to pursue something more in that field.\n\n3. **Balance and Prioritize**: If you decide to go back to school, consider part-time classes. Many people work and study simultaneously, but it's important to find a balance that works for you. Prioritize what's most important to you right now, whether it's education, work, or relationships.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Overthinking can be paralyzing, so try setting small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning something new or setting aside time each week to explore different interests.\n\n5. **Stay Open and Flexible**: Life is a journey, and it's okay to change paths.

Instead of trying to figure out your entire life right now, let's break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nFirst, you don't need to commit to a massive career change immediately. Start by exploring your interests in design and working with animals in small ways. You could volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends or take some free online design courses (like on Coursera or YouTube) to test the waters without a huge commitment.\n\nAbout school - yes, many people work full-time while studying. It's challenging but doable, especially if you start part-time with just 1-2 classes. Community colleges are great for this because they're more affordable and offer flexible schedules. You can always transfer credits later if you decide to pursue a full degree.\n\nThe key is to start small and build discipline gradually. Pick ONE thing - maybe a single evening class or a weekend volunteer position - and commit to it for 3 months. Use that experience to learn about yourself and what you actually enjoy doing (not just what you think you might enjoy).\n\nRemember that your first step doesn't have to be your forever step.

Alternatively, you could try listening to music or nature sounds that you find uplifting or stimulating. Some people also find that doing something creative, like drawing or writing, can help them break out of a brain fog cycle.

Note *everything* you eat and drink, and *exactly* when your brain fog hits. You might find a pattern you're missing \u2013 like a sensitivity to a specific ingredient or a link to meal timing.\n\nSecond, with exercise, are you doing the same thing every time? Maybe your brain needs a different kind of stimulation. Try switching it up \u2013 if you always run, try swimming or rock climbing. The novelty might kickstart things.\n\nThird, since showers help, maybe it's the temperature change that's doing the trick? Try splashing cold water on your face or holding an ice pack to the back of your neck when the fog rolls in. It's a quick and accessible way to mimic the shower effect.\n\nFinally, and this is a bit out there, but have you looked into vagus nerve stimulation?

    "post_body":">TLDR:  How do I escape from escapism?\n\nThe title says it all. I find myself escaping from my problems, and indulge myself in other (less important) activities that wastes my time. I understand it won't help me or be productive in anyway but i can't help it. \nAfter a lot of contemplating I figured it's just me trying to escape from everything that's even mildly unpleasant. It is stagnating my growth and I'm just sick of it.\n\nSo I've come here asking for your help",
    "comment_best_human":"I'd suggest to try breaking down the 'complex' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)\n\nFor example: \n\n1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you're trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were\/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your 'excuse' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. \n\nThe goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being 'complex' or 'scary'. You just see all things you did 'wrong' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren't that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be 'beaten' \/ fixed.\n\nBesides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to 'stop escaping' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don't need it. Let's cross-check it altogether, let's not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you'd like to stop escaping in first place.\n\n**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let's imagine (for example) it's social media. \n\nFine - for the list of things you 'escaped', out of 10 things - let's imagine that 5 were 'escaped' due to social media distraction. If it's true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it's something else - doesn't matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).\n\n**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https:\/\/maxreva.com\/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits\/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before). Getting back to this same file will help you a lot, because it'll be your \"center for fighting escapism\" in some way. And a place where your next decisions\/healthy habits might be started from.",

    "comment_gpt4":"Escapism is something a lot of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. One approach to tackle this is to start small and gradually build up your discipline. First, identify the specific activities you use for escapism and set limits on them. For example, if you find yourself binge-watching shows, decide on a specific time limit for watching each day. \n\nNext, try to replace some of that escapism time with activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or going for a walk to clear your mind. \n\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for the tasks you're avoiding. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming. Reward yourself for completing these tasks, even if it's just a small treat or a break to do something you enjoy. \n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to seek help if you need it. Sometimes talking to someone about what you're avoiding can provide new insights and motivation. Keep at it, and be patient with yourself as you work on building better habits.",
    "comment_claude":"Escaping from challenges is a really common human response - our brains are wired to seek comfort and avoid discomfort. The key is gradually building your \"discomfort muscle\" rather than trying to transform overnight.\n\nStart by picking just ONE mildly uncomfortable but important task each day. Set a timer for just 10 minutes and commit to working on it for that short duration. When the timer goes off, you can choose to continue or stop - but usually once you start, it's easier to keep going.\n\nA helpful mindset shift is viewing discomfort as a signal of growth rather than something to avoid. When you notice yourself reaching for escape activities, pause and ask \"What am I trying to avoid right now?\" Then break that challenging thing into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nYou might also try the \"if\/then\" technique: \"If I feel the urge to escape into [activity], then I will first spend 10 minutes on [important task].\" This creates a small barrier between the impulse and the escape behavior while building positive momentum.\n\nRemember that perfect discipline isn't the goal - progress is. Even small steps toward facing challenges instead of avoiding them will compound over time. You've already taken a positive step by recognizing the pattern and seeking to change it.",
    "comment_llama":"Escapism can be a tough cycle to break, but recognizing the pattern is a huge first step. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - what are the specific situations or emotions that make you want to escape? Once you know what's driving your escapism, you can start working on more constructive ways to cope with those feelings. For example, if you're avoiding a particular task because it feels overwhelming, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Or, if you're using escapism to avoid stress or anxiety, consider replacing it with a healthier habit like exercise, meditation, or journaling. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and create an environment that supports productivity - this could mean turning your phone off during certain hours of the day, or finding a quiet workspace where you can focus. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and indulge in enjoyable activities occasionally, but by being more mindful of your habits and setting boundaries for yourself, you can start to build more discipline and make progress on the things that matter to you.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I get it. Escapism is a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you've already done the hardest part \u2013 recognizing the problem and wanting to change. That self-awareness is huge.\n\nInstead of trying to eliminate escapism entirely (which is super hard), maybe try to manage it and redirect that energy. Start small. Pick *one* thing you're avoiding and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, if you're avoiding studying, commit to just reading one page. Seriously, just one. Often, getting started is the biggest hurdle.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you're escaping. What's the unpleasant thing you're trying to avoid? Is it fear of failure? Boredom? Once you identify the root cause, you can start addressing that directly. Maybe that means finding a study buddy, changing your environment, or just acknowledging that it's okay to not be perfect.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect overnight. There will be days you slip up. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Small, consistent steps are way more effective than trying to make massive changes all at once. Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"I\u2019ve been there. One helpful approach is to start small: pick a single task you\u2019ve been avoiding and commit to working on it for just ten minutes. Once you begin, you\u2019ll often keep going longer than planned. If you really can\u2019t stand it, at least you\u2019ve chipped away at the task. Another strategy is to schedule your escapist activity for a specific time so it becomes a reward rather than a distraction. If you keep track of what triggers you to avoid real work\u2014maybe boredom, frustration, or fatigue\u2014you can head it off by taking short breaks or switching tasks before you wander off completely. Over time, these small steps build a habit of facing your responsibilities instead of running from them. It won\u2019t feel perfect at first, but committing to even a little progress each day helps you stay grounded and get things done without feeling stuck. Good luck.",

I feel like I am stuck in one of those hamster wheels, spinning it but getting no where.   \nAny advice on getting over this will be appreciated",
    "comment_best_human":"Let go of perfection. You won\u2019t feel like studying or exercising every day, no one does. You could try to make it a goal to sit down at your desk and open your book\/computer that day, even if you don\u2019t write anything down, that\u2019s part of the habit you\u2019re creating. For exercise - put on your sneakers and maybe tell yourself you only need to walk outside for five minutes. Usually once you\u2019re there starting then you\u2019ll feel like it, and putting less pressure on yourself helps.\n\nDo you have any one you can meet up with to study with? Any book clubs you can join online to motivate you to read to not fall behind?\n\nAnother thing with exercise is finding something you actually like doing, not an exercise for the sake of it.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone, I often feel the exact same way when I\u2019m having a low energy few days, but I\u2019m slowly finding things that work for me.",
    "comment_10th_human":"Start with one thing and start small. Maybe start with studying. Once you have a strong studying habit, add exercise. The once you've developed that, add reading. But don't rush. It'll take time (at least 21 days, if not more) to develop each one.",
    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to stick to a rigid routine, which can be overwhelming. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick one habit you want to build and focus on that. Make it as easy as possible to start with, like just 5 minutes of exercise or reading a page a day. Once that feels natural, gradually increase the time. Also, try to connect your habits to something you enjoy or find rewarding. This can help make the process feel less like a chore. Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Progress isn't always linear, and taking small steps consistently can lead to big changes over time. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small wins!",
    "comment_claude":"It sounds like you might be taking on too much at once and creating routines that feel restrictive rather than sustainable. Instead of trying to overhaul everything simultaneously, try picking just one small habit to focus on for now - something so easy you almost can't fail at it. Maybe that's reading for 5 minutes, or doing 2 pushups, or studying for 10 minutes.\n\nThe key is to make it ridiculously achievable. When you consistently hit these tiny goals, you'll start building confidence and momentum. Then you can gradually increase the duration or difficulty as it starts feeling natural.\n\nAnother approach that might help break the cycle: give yourself permission to be inconsistent. Rather than viewing habits as all-or-nothing commitments that you have to maintain perfectly, treat them more like experiments. If you miss a day or even a week, just pick back up where you left off without beating yourself up about it.\n\nRemember that building lasting habits is more like slowly turning a ship than flipping a switch. Small, consistent actions over time will get you much further than intense bursts followed by burnout. Start smaller than you think you need to, celebrate the tiny wins, and be patient with the process.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern of burnout from trying to stick to overly ambitious routines. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits incrementally, rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine at once. Instead of setting a goal to exercise every day, for example, try starting with just 2-3 times a week and see how that feels. You can always add more days or intensity later. \n\nAlso, consider prioritizing flexibility and self-care in your routine. It's great that you're recognizing the signs of burnout and depressive episodes, so make sure to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and adjust your goals as needed - it doesn't mean you've failed, it just means you're learning and adapting.\n\nAnother approach could be to focus on the underlying reasons why you want to build these habits, rather than just the habits themselves. What is it about exercising, reading, or studying that's truly important to you? Is it to feel more confident, to learn new things, or to improve your mental health? Connecting with your \"why\" can help make the process feel more meaningful and sustainable. \n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory along the way, even if it feels insignificant. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and seeking advice, so that's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, and try to be patient with yourself as you figure out what works best for you.",

    "comment_claude":"Hey there. First, know that what you're experiencing isn't uncommon at 18 - many people struggle with identity and feeling \"real\" at your age. But let's focus on some concrete steps you can take.\n\nStart incredibly small. Your mind is throwing up barriers because you're trying to tackle everything at once. Instead of thinking about becoming a whole different person, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Something so small it seems almost ridiculous - like drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or standing outside for 30 seconds each morning.\n\nThe goal isn't the habit itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on something. Each small win helps quiet that voice of fear and builds evidence that you can change.\n\nFor the gym specifically - don't think about \"becoming a gym person.\" Just focus on putting on your shoes and walking to the door. That's it. If you make it there and turn around, you've still succeeded. Usually once you're there, you'll work out anyway.\n\nAbout finding your core self - values aren't something you discover, they're something you build through actions. Pick one thing that matters to you (could be honesty, kindness, courage - anything) and take one tiny action aligned with it each day. Your identity will develop through what you do, not what you think about.\n\nConsider talking to your college's counseling services when you start - they're usually free for students and can help you develop more tools for managing these feelings.\n\nRemember: change happens through small, consistent actions, not giant transformations. Pick one tiny thing. Do it today. That's enough to start.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you're facing, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from yourself and unsure of how to break free from these patterns that are holding you back. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building self-awareness. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and start with tiny, manageable steps. For example, if you want to work on developing more discipline, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes something as simple as making your bed or taking a short walk. \n\nIt's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's normal for your values and personality to evolve over time. You don't have to have it all figured out at 18 - or even at 35, for that matter. What's important is that you're taking steps towards growth and self-improvement.\n\nIn terms of dealing with fear and ego, it might be helpful to practice some mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment, and give you the space to respond to them in a more intentional way. \n\nLastly, it's great that you're recognizing the importance of seeking help and support. If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can work with you to develop strategies for overcoming these challenges.

It takes courage to be this honest with yourself.\n\nIt's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you don't have to fix everything at once. Start small. You mentioned the gym \u2013 instead of focusing on some massive transformation, could you just commit to putting on your workout clothes and walking around the block? Seriously, that's it. The goal isn't to become a bodybuilder overnight, it's to break the inertia and prove to yourself that you *can* take action.\n\nRegarding feeling like you lack a core self, that's something a lot of people struggle with, especially at 18. Values aren't just things you're born with; they're things you discover and cultivate. Try exploring different ideas and activities. What makes you feel genuinely good, not just momentarily distracted? What kind of person do you *want* to be? Start journaling, even if it's just a few sentences a day. It can help you identify your values and track your progress.\n\nAs for the \"sinful acts\" and lack of control, that's where building habits comes in. It's not about willpower, it's about creating systems. If you know you're prone to certain impulses, identify the triggers and try to avoid them. Replace those impulses with something healthier. For example, if you get the urge to do something you regret, try doing 10 pushups or going for a quick walk instead.\n\nThe patterns you're stuck in? Start by picking *one* small pattern you want to break. Don't try to overhaul your entire life. Just focus on that one thing. When you recognize the pattern starting, consciously choose a different action. It will be uncomfortable, but that's how you create new neural pathways.\n\nCollege is a great opportunity for a fresh start. Join clubs, attend events, and meet new people. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and support your goals.\n\nFinally, if you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a professional. There are people who want to help you, and you don't have to go through this alone. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24\/7 at 988.\n\nYou're not made of stone. You're a work in progress, just like everyone else. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You've got this.\n",

Those small wins show you that you can decide to do something and follow through, which eventually helps quiet the fear that whispers you\u2019ll never change. If the idea of the gym scares you, try replacing it with another physical activity that fits your comfort zone first, like walks, jogging, or even short at-home workouts. Over time, you might find it easier to step into a gym once you\u2019re used to moving regularly.\n\nTry finding at least one thing that really grabs your interest, whether it\u2019s reading, art, music, or anything that makes you curious. Spending time on something you genuinely enjoy can anchor you in feeling like a person with passions rather than someone reacting to fear.

    "post_body":"TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?\n\n(30-Age)\nAlright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don\u2019t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very na\u00efve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don\u2019t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn\u2019t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don\u2019t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",
    "comment_best_human":"I\u2019ve been there, mate (I\u2019m 37M). Until recently I was feeling the same way you do, but I am really turning things around. I\u2019ve been doing what I can to turn myself around. I\u2019ve been going to therapy, I\u2019ve been working on myself by looking long and hard at my life, I\u2019ve been working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof method, etc. What really started to make a big difference was my diet - I went zero carb and my mental health improved dramatically. The effect would not have been so big without the other stuff, I think. \nIn short - have faith, work on yourself, try every day, strive to be and one day you will wake up who you want to be.",
    "comment_10th_human":"1.Write down honestly what you are addicted to\n\n2.Challenge yourself to be a certain amount of weeks without these addiction. Every time you succeed for a few days you have changed a little.\n\nThis way you will stop downing out you inner voice. Whenever you feel lost and don't know what to do stop whatever you are doing and do nothing at all. When you seek comfort in social media or entertainment you will never find yourself.\n\nBelieve me. You will come to this sensation of confusion over and over again. The only way to move forward is to spend in excessive amount of time with yourself. Your own mind, your creativity and your voice. Until you find what you really want to with your life.",
    "comment_gpt4":"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and considering therapy and talking to a doctor. That's a huge step in the right direction. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar feelings and challenges.\n\nStarting small can be really helpful. Pick one thing you want to work on and focus on that. It could be as simple as setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a hobby or exercise. The key is to build small, manageable habits that can gradually lead to bigger changes. \n\nAlso, try to be kind to yourself. It's easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate your wins, even if they seem minor. \n\nLastly, don't compare your journey to others. Everyone has their own path, and what works for someone else might not work for you. Focus on what makes you feel good and what you want to achieve. You've got this!",
    "comment_claude":"First off - you're not weak, and you're taking a huge positive step by seeking therapy and medical support. That's actually really strong.\n\nStarting over with discipline when you feel scattered is tough, but here's what works: Start ridiculously small. I mean tiny. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE thing - maybe making your bed each morning, or drinking a glass of water when you wake up. Something so small it feels almost silly. Do just that one thing consistently for a week.\n\nThe key is building evidence for yourself that you CAN follow through. Each tiny win creates momentum. Once that first habit feels automatic (usually 1-2 weeks), add one more small thing. Maybe a 5-minute walk, or putting dishes directly in the dishwasher after eating.\n\nYour ADD makes this harder, so work with it rather than against it. Use external systems - set specific times, use reminders, make things visible. Put your workout clothes right by your bed if exercise is your goal. Make the good choice the easy choice.\n\nThe self-hate stuff is rough, but action comes first, feelings follow. You don't need to feel worthy or confident to start - you just need to start. Focus on doing rather than feeling.\n\nRemember: You're not starting over \"late\" - you're starting exactly when you needed to. Many people never start at all. Take it one absurdly small step at a time, celebrate those tiny wins, and keep building from there. You've got this.",
    "comment_llama":"It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge where you're at and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking this first step. It's clear that you've been carrying around a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's understandable that it's hard to envision a future for yourself when you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, focus on building one or two new habits that you can realistically stick to. This could be something as simple as taking a short walk each day, or dedicating 10 minutes each morning to meditation or journaling. The key is to build momentum and start to see yourself as capable of making positive changes.\n\nIt's also great that you're seeking out therapy and speaking with a doctor - having a support system in place can make a huge difference in your journey. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and that you don't have to have it all figured out right now. You're not weak for struggling with depression and anxiety - these are serious conditions that require treatment and support.\n\nIn terms of finding your passions and interests, you might try exploring different activities or hobbies without putting too much pressure on yourself to find \"the one thing\" that you're meant to do. Sometimes, it's the process of trying new things and seeing what sticks that can help us discover our strengths and interests. And don't worry if you don't have a clear vision for your future right now - that can develop over time as you continue to work on yourself and build your confidence.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself - it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks, and it doesn't mean that you're not worth it. You are worthy of growth, success, and happiness, regardless of your past or your struggles. Keep in mind that everyone starts from somewhere, and it's never too late to make a change and start building the life you want.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're reaching out and wanting to change is a huge first step. It's definitely not easy, but it's possible.\n\nFirst, good on you for seeking therapy and talking to a doctor. That's crucial, especially with ADD and potential depression\/anxiety. Meds can help level the playing field, and therapy can give you tools to manage your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nAs for the \"starting from zero\" feeling, I get it. It's overwhelming to think about fixing everything at once. Instead of a complete overhaul, try focusing on ONE small habit at a time. Seriously, just one. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. Something achievable that you can consistently do. Once that feels automatic, add another small habit.\n\nRegarding the lack of passion\/career direction, don't beat yourself up. A lot of people feel that way. Instead of searching for some grand purpose, try exploring different activities. Volunteer, take a class, join a club \u2013 just try things that vaguely interest you. You might stumble upon something you enjoy, or at least learn what you *don't* like.\n\nThe self-sabotage and fear of success are common. Therapy can help you unpack those feelings. In the meantime, try reframing your thinking. Instead of \"I'm not worth it,\" try \"I deserve to give myself a chance.\" It sounds cheesy, but small shifts in perspective can make a difference.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. You're not going to transform overnight. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're back at square one. That's okay. Just keep showing up and trying. Celebrate small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this.\n",
    "comment_o1":"Starting small can really help when everything seems overwhelming. Try picking just one habit or goal\u2014something doable\u2014and commit to it daily. For example, if you want to build consistency, set a specific time to wake up or tackle one recurring task (like tidying up your space) each day so your brain gets used to the rhythm. If it feels too hard, scale it down until it\u2019s almost impossible to fail. Little wins give you a sense of forward momentum and help rebuild trust in yourself. Therapy and talking with your doctor are great moves too. It can take time to figure out what sparks real motivation, but each small success strengthens that discipline muscle. Even if it feels awkward at first, keep pushing forward and let those daily actions speak louder than your doubts.",

    "post_body":"I do a multitude of things. I write, read, draw, make music, design book covers, learn languages and lately picked up (and dropped) chess. I even liked studying because I loved my field. \n\nI just can't seem to tolerate the actual process of sitting down and engaging in any of them anymore. I really want to but I can't stand it. I can't write anything, can't draw, can't study--can't stand doing anything persistantly for more than 10 to 15 minutes. I get stressed out and anxious pretty easily and quickly switch to something else to detach my mind. \n\n\nOn the rare occasions I sit down and really get sucked into something I *can* actually go for hours on end. If I can somehow get myself to be like this all the time, I'd be killing it rn. But it feels like there's a block in my mind stopping me, like a writer's block or an art block, except for my mind as a whole. Cheesy analogy, I know. \n\n\nThought maybe adhd for a while but I dropped that suspicion. Can't say if I've always been like this. This either started or became noticeably bad enough at the beginning of last year\/late 2020. Can't say much about my childhood since i don't remember much anyways beside just being a lonely weirdo. \n\n\nPersonal life aside, my greatest concern rn is my tilting academics. I know what I need to do, I can hash out a good plan to do it, I want to do it, I know I can if I can bring myself to it. But I just can't. Can't start, can't keep going. Some days I'm moderately motivated, others I'm detached. Either way I'm doing nothing. Semester started about six weeks ago, I'm quickly falling behind. My mind, body and heart are refusing to cooperate. \n\n\nCan't afford time and money for therapists atm. If anyone has any tips on how to manage this on my own and combat this behaviourally\/mentally please share\n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to emphasize that I do not believe I have had this issue further back than 2021 or 2020. I'm turning 23. This is fairly recent. I relate to r\/adhd but it's hard to distinguish adhd from chronic stress for example. The symptoms are similar, the actual culprit is hard to pin point. So I don't think specifically assuming adhd out of a whole bunch is wise, and I'm trying not to carry it anymore \n\nEither way I'm looking for practical tips that don't involve me going to a therapist because there are literally none around me and if I find one I can't afford seeing them or the meds (bc, developing country w civil unrest rn)",
    "comment_best_human":"Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD\/anxiety\/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help",
    "comment_10th_human":"Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'",
    "comment_gpt4":"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few strategies that might help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes to work on a task. The goal is to make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n2. **Routine and Environment**: Create a dedicated space and time for your activities. Even if it's just a corner of your room, having a consistent spot can help signal to your brain that it's time to focus.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Breaks**: Practice mindfulness techniques to help manage stress and anxiety. Also, schedule regular breaks to prevent burnout. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break) can be effective.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what typically distracts you and try to minimize these interruptions. This could mean turning off notifications or using apps that block distracting websites.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of each day, take a few minutes to reflect on what worked and what didn\u2019t. Adjust your approach as needed.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
    "comment_claude":"Your situation sounds really challenging, especially since it's a relatively recent change that's affecting multiple areas of your life. The good news is that you've already identified some key things: you know you're capable of deep focus (those rare occasions when you get absorbed for hours), and you have clear goals and plans. That's actually a strong foundation to build from.\n\nHere's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start treating focus like a muscle that needs gradual training. Instead of aiming for long study sessions right away, set a timer for just 5 minutes. That's less than your current threshold of 10-15 minutes, which makes it more manageable. The key is consistency over duration - do these 5-minute sessions multiple times a day.\n\nWhen you sit down for these sessions, keep your phone in another room and close all browser tabs except what you absolutely need. Create a clear physical and mental boundary between \"focus time\" and \"everything else.\"\n\nAfter a week of consistent 5-minute sessions, bump it up to 7 minutes. Then 10. Then 15. The gradual increase helps build tolerance without triggering the stress response you're experiencing. Think of it like building stamina - you wouldn't start training for a marathon by running 26 miles on day one.\n\nFor your academics specifically, try the \"just one problem\" approach. Instead of thinking about an entire study session, commit to solving just one problem or reading just one page. Often, starting is the hardest part, and this removes that mental barrier.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear. Some days you'll do better than others, and that's normal. The goal is to slowly rebuild your capacity for sustained attention through consistent, small steps rather than trying to force yourself back to where you were before 2020.",
    "comment_llama":"It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough situation, especially with your academics suffering. First, let's break down the fact that you can get engaged in activities for hours when you're fully into them - this suggests that the issue isn't necessarily with your ability to focus, but rather with initiating and maintaining that focus consistently. \n\nOne strategy you might find helpful is the \"2-minute rule\". When you're struggling to start a task, tell yourself you'll work on it for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you can continue beyond those initial 2 minutes. This can help build momentum.\n\nAnother approach could be to identify the specific points at which you feel your motivation or focus start to wane. Is it always after a certain amount of time? When you encounter a particular type of task or difficulty? Once you're more aware of these patterns, you can develop strategies to address them, such as taking short breaks before you reach that point of frustration, or breaking down larger tasks into smaller, less daunting ones.\n\nGiven your situation with limited access to therapists and the challenges in your environment, it might also be helpful to look into free online resources and communities focused on productivity, focus, and mental health. There are many blogs, podcasts, and forums where people share their experiences and tips for managing similar issues without professional help.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day or week, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they seem, as this can help build motivation over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.",
    "comment_gemini":"Hey, I hear you. It sounds frustrating to have all these interests and the drive to do them, but then hitting a wall after only a few minutes. Since you mentioned it started fairly recently, maybe we can look at some strategies to break this down.\n\nFirst, try the Pomodoro Technique, but with *really* short bursts. Forget 25 minutes; aim for 5-minute work intervals with a 2-minute break. Seriously. Set a timer. The goal isn't to achieve a ton in those 5 minutes, but to prove to yourself you *can* sit down and focus, even for a tiny bit. Gradually increase the work intervals as you feel comfortable.\n\nSecond, think about \"habit stacking.\" Link something you *enjoy* doing with something you *need* to do. For example, \"After I play one song on guitar (enjoyable), I'll work on my book cover design for 10 minutes (task).\" The enjoyable activity acts as a reward and a trigger.\n\nThird, and this might sound counterintuitive, embrace the switching. Instead of fighting the urge to jump between tasks, schedule it. Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities. Knowing you *will* get to draw later might make it easier to focus on studying *now*. This can help you feel less trapped and more in control.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot, and it's okay to have off days. Don't beat yourself up if you can't focus. Just acknowledge it, and try again tomorrow. Small, consistent steps are key. Good luck, you got this!\n",
    "comment_o1":"Sometimes, going smaller and simpler helps. Try telling yourself you\u2019re only going to do a task for five minutes. For those five minutes, remove as many distractions as you can: silence your phone, close unrelated apps, and commit to that short burst. If you feel like continuing, keep going; otherwise, stop and come back later for another small session. These short, focused intervals can gradually train your mind to stay on tasks longer. You can also pick the easiest part of what you need to do first\u2014like free-writing a couple lines or sketching a rough outline\u2014so you lower the mental barrier to getting started. Even if you have to repeat these mini-sessions multiple times a day, it can help you ease into deeper focus and build up your tolerance for longer sessions. Over time, the five-minute rule can grow into a habit and make it easier to push through the initial resistance without feeling stuck or overwhelmed.",
