      "body": "I really feel like a complete failure. I Can’t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I’m not as productive as I’d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I’m just so disappointed in my self. It’s hard to drink water. I’m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I’m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I’m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I’m just mad at life. I’m not depressed I’m just disappointed. \n\nI’m a ball full of energy. I’m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I’m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I’m a caffeine addict. I don’t know how I will function without my meds when I’m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven’t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don’t wanna do. I’m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don’t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can’t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I’m\nTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",

        "interv1_best_human": "Re: the meds part, why? Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn’t expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking. So what’s wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain? That’s how my psychiatrist framed it to me, lol.\n\nAlso: “drug holidays” aren’t required, and with BED they can backfire (rebound appetite, lethargy). Worth asking your prescriber about daily dosing, timing, or a different formulation—and to make a pregnancy plan now so you’re not white‑knuckling it later. CBT‑E and/or a dietitian for BED can help a ton.\n\n5‑minute “now” starter:\n- Fill a big water bottle.\n- Set a 5‑minute timer and do the first micro‑move on one task (open the course, press play, or put on shoes).\n\nWhy this helps: tiny first moves drop the activation energy and start momentum. Pair them with If‑Then rules so you don’t have to rely on motivation:\n- If it’s an off‑med day, then I eat a protein+fiber breakfast, do a 10‑minute walk, and one 10‑minute focus block with my phone in another room.\n\nMenu by energy level (pick what fits):\n- Low battery: water bottle + protein/produce each meal + one 10‑minute walk or stretch + one 10‑minute focus block.\n- Medium: 2 x 25/5 focus blocks; body‑double (StudyWithMe/Discord); simple snack prepped (yogurt+fruit, eggs+toast).\n- High: 3 x 25/5 blocks; prep tomorrow’s snacks; 10‑minute tidy.\n\nBinge plan:\n- Eat every 3–4 hours (don’t “earn” food).\n- Pre‑plate snacks; keep trigger foods out of sight/portion them.\n- When an urge hits, set a 10‑minute timer (urge surf) and sip water. If a binge happens, next meal is back on plan—no punishment.\n\nCaffeine: try a cap (e.g., before noon) and pair with food/water to reduce crashes.\n\nTiny feedback loop:\n- Daily 3 boxes: Water? Moved 10 min? One focus block? Check 2/3 = win. Review weekly and adjust one thing.\n\nYou’re not broken—you’re building systems that fit your brain. Use the tools (including meds) and keep the steps small and repeatable.",
        "interv2_best_human": "As a fellow Vyvanse taker, be kind to yourself. Using Vyvanse is not a moral failure. Like insulin for diabetes, it treats a real condition. It is also fine to build skills for off days. Try a 5-minute timer to start one tiny task. Have you asked your prescriber whether the two-day breaks are necessary? Only your prescriber can guide med changes.",
        "interv1_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. The on/off med swing and binge urges are real—you’re not broken.\n\nRight now: drink a full glass of water and set a 5‑minute timer to tidy one small spot.\n\n1. Start Small: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session. Small wins build momentum.\n\n2. Plan Your Days Off: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n   30s: fill your water bottle. 5 min: stretch or wipe a counter. 20 min: walk or prep a simple meal.\n\n3. Mindful Eating: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices. Regular meals/snacks can reduce binge urges; consider a therapist/registered dietitian for BED support.\n\n4. Limit Phone Time: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. Exercise Regularly: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change. If you slip: 60s breathing, drink water, do one 2‑minute task, move on.\n\nFor studying/trading: try 10‑minute focus sprints (10 on/2 off x2–3). ADHD brains like clear start/stop cues.\n\nTrack for 7 days: med vs off, cups of water, # of 10‑min focus blocks, energy 1–5. Review on day 8 and adjust one thing.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Don’t change meds without your prescriber; ask about off‑day rebound eating. If you’re in immediate danger, call local emergency services or 988 (US). You’ve got this!",
        "interv2_gpt4o": "Hey there, and thanks for reaching out. You are juggling a lot, and it makes sense to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better.\n\n1. Start small. Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Stick with it daily for 2 to 4 weeks, then add another small habit like a 5 minute walk or a short meditation.\n\n2. Plan your days off. Since you feel lethargic on Vyvanse free days, plan low energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room. Give yourself one full relaxed day now and then to recharge without guilt.\n\n3. Mindful eating. Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel, and add a short daily journal note about your energy and mood.\n\n4. Limit phone time. Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. For example, try a 30 minute window in the evening. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. Exercise regularly. Even on days you do not feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It does not have to be intense, even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. Celebrate small wins. Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\n\nAlso, talk to someone you trust for support, and if you can, work with a professional who understands ADHD so you are not doing this alone.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You have got this."

My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines . At times I feel like I'm crazy cause I can be somewhat miserable on more than one occasion and can't interact very well with other people. People are fed up for good reason. I dont have a life",

This can open up new opportunities and help you meet like‑minded people.\n\n3. Build a Routine: Anchor three dailies: move, connect, apply/learn (M‑C‑A). Consistency beats intensity.\n\n4. Reconnect with People: One message a day to an old friend or family member. Join a local group/class related to your interests. Awkward is normal; reps make it easier.\n\n5. Consider Professional Help: A therapist or counselor (sliding‑scale/community clinics) can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\n\nIf you slip, do a 2‑minute reset (breathe, pick one tiny action), then move on.\n\nTry this, tiered:\n- 30s: text “thinking of you” to someone\n- 5 min: save 1 job posting and DM a gym about shadowing\n- 20 min: update your resume and send 1 application or attend a class/meetup\n\nFor one week, track M‑C‑A checkboxes daily; review next Sunday and adjust.",

      "body": "TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?\n\n(30-Age)\nAlright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don’t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very naïve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",

You’re not weak—ADHD/depression/time‑blindness + shame is a brutal combo, and it’s workable with supports.\n\nWhat I did: therapy, really looking at my life, working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof/breathwork, etc. The surprising lever for me was diet—I went zero carb and my mental health improved a lot. That’s just my experience; I’d run any big diet change past your doctor (esp. with meds). You don’t need extreme: a protein‑heavy breakfast, fewer liquid sugars, and more water can steady energy/mood.\n\nIf you want a 5‑minute start today:\n- 3‑minute timer: write 1 bare‑minimum for tomorrow (e.g., take meds, email a therapist, 10‑min walk).\n- 2 minutes now: lay out meds/clothes, fill a water bottle, or do dishes for 2 minutes. Done counts.\n\nADHD‑friendly helps that actually stick:\n- Externalize + time‑box: one capture list; pick ONE task; work 10 minutes; stop. (Less working‑memory load, more momentum.)\n- Body‑doubling: Focusmate/ADHD coworking/Discord; sit with someone and start.\n- Energy tiers: low = shower + eat protein; medium = 10‑min walk; high = full workout.\n\nWhen you miss: shrink, don’t quit. Restart the same day. Measure “did I show up?” not perfection.\n\nTiny feedback loop (2 lines at night): “What helped?” “What got in the way?” + quick energy rating.

      "body": "When I (30s M) have feelings, whether it be love, betrayal, happiness, sadness, etc, I feel it deeply, to the point my emotions affect my thought and decision making processes. My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.",
      "comments": {
        "interv1_best_human": "I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up. Feeling everything so intensely is exhausting—you're not broken. Emotions are data, not directives; the goal is to feel them and still choose your actions.\n\nTiny first step you can try right now (≤2 min): STOP. Stop. Take 3 slow breaths (make the exhale longer than the inhale). Observe and name 1–3 feelings and rate them 0–10. Proceed with the smallest next step you won’t regret tomorrow. Naming feelings + long exhales helps the thinking part of your brain come back online.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation) If recording feels cringe, type a note instead, or let your phone auto-transcribe. Even 60 seconds helps.\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that. Make it one clear sentence and one small action.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me. If sitting still is hard, just do 1–3 minutes of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6–8). Longer exhales tell your nervous system to calm down.\n\n4. Decision hygiene for “hot” moments: if your emotion rating is >6/10, wait 24 hours before big decisions. Jot a 2-column list: “What I hope for” vs “What I actually receive.” Pick the next action Future-You will thank you for in 48 hours. Track one thing daily: “Did I pause before acting? (Y/N).” Review weekly for patterns.\n\n5. If this intensity is wrecking sleep/work, or you’re feeling unsafe, please loop in a pro (CBT/DBT skills are great for emotion regulation). If substances are in the mix, or this came on suddenly, a check-in with a doctor can help rule out other stuff.\n\nWhen you miss a step, that’s normal. Aim for B‑minus consistency, not perfection. Good luck!",
        "interv2_best_human": "You are not alone and this is workable. I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up. You could start by setting a 5 minute timer and just begin. Naming and accepting emotions can lower their intensity, and meditation has evidence for improving emotional regulation.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned.\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let it out. If recording feels uncomfortable, just talk without saving it, or type your thoughts into a chat with an AI like ChatGPT. After, if you recorded, try listening back as if you were hearing a friend vent, since we can be more patient and less judgmental with others. Then ask questions to fix the problem or get to the root. Why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might it come from, is there a pattern. It all depends on whether you want to brainstorm how to fix a problem or go back in your past to understand the why so you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control.\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works.\n\n2.

Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing.

        "interv1_gpt4o": "It sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions, and it's great that you're looking to find a way to manage them better. Feeling things deeply is valid—you're not alone. One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing—in for 4, out for 6. When emotions arise, name them (“this is anger/sadness”) and rate them 1–10 without judging or reacting immediately. Naming + longer exhales calm the body’s alarm so your thinking brain can weigh in.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment. Quick template: Facts / Feelings / Options / One next step.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Add an if‑then: “If I feel intense emotion, I wait 10–24 hours before big decisions or sending messages.”\n\nScalable pause options:\n- 30s: 3 slow breaths, name + rate the feeling, delay action.\n- 5min: breathe + write one sentence: “What would Future Me thank me for?”\n- 20min: journal quick pros/cons and pick one tiny step.\n\nIf you slip, no big deal—do a 60‑second reset and try again. Track pauses and your rating before/after for 1 week; review on day 7.",
        "interv2_gpt4o": "It sounds like you feel emotions really strongly, and it is great you want to manage them. Mindfulness helps because it is not suppressing feelings but noticing them without acting. Sit for a few minutes, focus on your breathing, and watch the emotion rise and fall to create space between feeling and action.\n\nJournaling can surface patterns, and setting small, value aligned goals builds confidence to act even when feelings are loud.\n\nWhen emotions spike, try a quick STOP routine\n- Stop\n- Take three slow breaths\n- Observe by naming the emotion 0 to 10 and the urge it is pushing\n- Proceed with a one minute decision card asking What would I tell a friend and What action serves my long term values\n\nFor example, if you want to send an angry text, you might name anger 7 out of 10 and the urge to fire back, then choose a short, respectful reply that fits your long term values.\n\nIf you want extra support, you can look up DBT STOP or talk with a therapist."

I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. \n\nI have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. \n\nHow can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.\n\nEdit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted.

        "interv1_best_human": "26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. I’m sorry you’re hurting—when your brain is this heavy, consistency is hard, and that’s not a character flaw.\n\nFirst, safety: if you’re having active thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else, please reach out now. In the US call/text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org; otherwise use your local crisis line or go to the nearest ER. Tell your prescriber how you’re feeling; meds that keep you barely afloat deserve a review. Don’t stop or change meds without them.\n\nFigure out what you want out of life and work backwards. It doesn’t have to be huge—“live comfortably,” “travel,” “buy a house,” “have close friendships,” etc. Life is short, but it’s longer than you think. The lever most people can pull (besides luck) is consistency—but design it to be tiny and doable.\n\n5‑minute starter (pick one):\n- Text someone: “I’m not doing well. Can we talk this week?”\n- Open Notes and write a 90‑day goal + the smallest daily action (2–5 minutes). Set a reminder.\n\nMake it stick:\n- Pick one area (health, money/career, or relationships).\n- Set a “minimum” for bad days and a “standard” for normal days (e.g., minimum = 5‑minute walk or 5 minutes on applications; standard = 25 minutes).\n- Use a timer. Show up > intensity. “Never miss twice.”\n- Weekly 10‑minute check‑in: Did I show up? What got in the way? Adjust the plan, not your worth.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks. If it’s “get a good job,” pick a skill you can self‑teach and commit to a small daily block plus the job search. If it’s “meet people,” do one rep a day (say hi, message one person, one social rep). Small wins build momentum and your brain starts to expect progress.\n\nCareer ideas:\n- Front‑end JS dev is learnable and has tons of free resources—build small projects and a portfolio, apply widely.\n- With your journalism degree, also look at technical writing/UX writing/documentation, grant writing, content marketing, or customer support → internal comms. Start a tiny portfolio (2–3 sample guides or doc rewrites).\n- Reduce pressure where possible (e.g., get on income‑driven repayment for loans if you’re in the US).\n\nIn 3 years your life can be unrecognizable. You could be thirty, in a happier place, with work you like. The gap between that you and today is the little bit you do—consistently—most days between now and then.",

It does not have to be huge. It could be travel, buy a house, build a comfortable life, or get married and raise a family. Pick one thing and make it the target.\n\nHere is a simple plan to start\n\n- Mental health first. Tell a professional how you feel today. If you have a therapist or prescriber, call or message them and be direct about the suicidal thoughts. If you do not, look up low cost counseling or community clinics and book one intake. Go at your own pace and be kind to yourself.\n\n- Ease money stress. Call your loan servicer and ask about income driven repayment, deferment, or hardship forbearance. A nonprofit credit counselor can walk you through options for free.\n\n- Build a path you can stick with. Break the big goal into tiny daily actions and commit to them. If you want a self taught route, front end web development is one option with many free resources, but it does not have to be coding. Set a 10 minute timer today and just begin.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching a goal may only take a couple years if you really stick to it, then you can move on to the next thing. Being successful is a skill that gets easier the more you practice it. In three years your life can be entirely different. The difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in most days between now and then. Keep moving.",

Many people have felt stuck and found a way forward, and you can too. I’m glad you posted.\n\nLet’s start small. It might help to focus on building a routine that gives you a sense of control and accomplishment. Right now: set a 3‑minute timer and write one tiny task you’ll do today (shower, 10‑min walk, tidy one spot), then do just that. Small wins reduce overwhelm and build momentum. Start with something simple, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a new hobby or skill. It doesn't have to be perfect or big, just something you can stick to and gradually build on. Scalable options: 30s—drink water/open curtains; 5min—tidy one spot or a short walk; 20min—watch a tutorial (SEO/copy/Canva) or draft 150 words for a writing sample.\n\nConsider exploring interests outside of your current job. There are tons of free resources online to learn new skills. Your journalism skills (writing, research, interviewing) are useful for content/marketing/communications—free courses can bridge the gap.\n\nAlso, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a game-changer. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation. It's great that you're already on medication, but therapy can offer additional tools to help manage those tough thoughts. Don’t change meds without your prescriber.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. If you slip: 60‑second reset—slow breaths, pick one tiny action, restart at the next hour. For 7 days, track wake time, one 10‑min focus block, and mood 1–5; review on day 8 and adjust. You’ve taken a big step by reaching out here—keep going, one day at a time.\n\nIf you’re in immediate danger, call local emergency services or a crisis line (988 in the U.S.).",

You might be surprised by what sticks. Therapy alongside your meds can add tools for the toughest thoughts and help you map next steps.\n\nTry to gently shift attention from what is going wrong to one thing you can do today. Day by day, with steady effort, you will make progress. Celebrate the small wins when they show up.\n\nSafety plan if urges rise or you feel close to acting. Pause and slow your breathing. Put time and distance between you and any means, and ask someone you trust to hold or lock them away. Tell a trusted person or your therapist what is going on. In the US call or text 988. Outside the US call your local emergency number or a crisis line. If you are in immediate danger, go to an ER or call emergency services.\n\nReaching out here was a real step. One day at a time.

Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated.

You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It’s completely normal, so try to not beat yourself up about it. It’s going to happen, it’s going to be ok, and it does get better.\n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is not a rigid, self‑enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self‑anger from messing up just leads to more depression. What I can do is set tiny “floors” so I always get credit and build momentum:\n- Therapy program: open it and do 2 minutes (bonus if more).\n- Meditation: 1 minute.\n- Workout: 1 pushup or a 5‑minute walk.\n- Social: step into a store and ask one simple question, or just say “hi” to a cashier.\n\nWhy this works: small starts break avoidance and give you quick wins; exposure gets easier with frequent reps, not perfect sessions. Missing a day isn’t failure, it’s data. If I miss, I just do the floor the next day. “Never miss twice” helps, but compassion first.\n\n5‑minute start tonight: write your floors on a sticky note, lay out workout clothes, pick one store and a one‑line script (“Hi, where are the batteries?”), and set a reminder for the time you’re most likely to do it. On low days, do just one floor and call it a win.\n\nThings that helped me stick with it:\n- Habit trackers: Loop (Android), Streaks/Done (iOS), or Habitica if you like gamified.\n- Timers: Insight Timer for 1‑minute meditations; Pomodoro/Forest for focus.\n- Body‑doubling/accountability: Focusmate or Study Together Discords.\n- Weekly 5‑minute check‑in: mood 1–10, what helped, one tweak for next week.\n\nTo get around people, I try to break away from my daily routine and go see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local third place a few times a week—cafe, library, climbing gym, or a bar at a quieter time. I’ll often order water/coffee and sit; staff or regulars eventually recognize you and it gets easier. If you do bars, consider alcohol‑free times/drinks.\n\nAnd loop your therapist/program in if the depression uptick sticks—they can help you tweak exposures or add supports. You’ve got this.",
        "interv2_best_human": "Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to hold onto as you slide into and out of depression.\n\nOne thing I will say is that it is a journey. It is going to take a while. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. That is completely normal. If you slip and feel bad about it, that feeling is valid, and it can still be ok. It does get better.\n\nFor me, the single biggest thing was letting go of a rigid, self-enforced schedule. I cannot ever do it well enough for that to fix anything, and the self-anger from messing up just leads to more depression. What I can do is make small, manageable breaks from my daily routine. I see new things, even if I am alone. It was awkward at first, but someone will often take you under their wing and help you feel comfortable enough to get to know others.",
        "interv1_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking such proactive steps with your program and recognizing the need for change. That's a huge first step. I hear you—doing exposures while feeling low is hard, and you’ve already shown a ton of courage. When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. Small wins teach your brain you’re safe and build momentum.\n\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. To make it scalable, pick the smallest that feels doable:\n- Therapy: 30s open the module, 5min one prompt, 20min full chunk.\n- Meditation: 30s 3 breaths, 5min guided, 20min session.\n- Workout: 30s 5 squats, 5min walk, 20min routine.\n- Social: 30s say “hi”/ask a cashier a question, 5min step into a store, 20min brief chat/call.\n\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Daylio is nice for quick mood tracking. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through, or find one accountability buddy.\n\nIf you slip, do a quick reset: 60 seconds of breathing, do the 30s version, and move on. Never miss twice. It’s okay to have off days—don’t let a slip turn into a fall. Be kind to yourself and focus on getting back on track the next day.\n\nTiny start now: set a 3-minute timer, write tomorrow’s 30s versions in your notes, and lay out anything you need. Track yes/no for each habit + mood 1–5 for 7 days; review on day 8 and adjust. And keep your therapist/program in the loop about the depressive dip—they can help you scale exposures safely. You’ve got this!",

        "interv1_best_human": "I’d recommend reading a book called So Good They Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport. He makes the claim that this idea of finding your passion is mostly nonsense. Instead, real passion is forged through years of effort and dedication. (He gives a more nuanced take in the book though)\n\nQuick takeaway: passion tends to follow mastery + autonomy + impact. You build that by shipping useful things and getting feedback, not by waiting to “feel it.”\n\nGiven what you wrote (honesty, wanting to connect with people, liking analysis but wanting to implement), try this:\n\n- 5‑minute start now: open a note and list 3 real problems you see (your online biz customers, friends, your own routines). Pick one you could tackle in 2–4 weeks using skills you already have. Define a tiny deliverable a real person can use (e.g., a simple A/B test for one product, a 3–5 min explainer that helps someone choose a supplement, a small consumer insight + fix you actually implement).\n- Run a 4‑week “small bet”: 3 x 25‑min focus blocks per week. Goal: ship one thing and ask 3 people for feedback.\n- Energy menu:\n  - Low: 10 min learning + 5‑sentence summary.\n  - Medium: run one micro‑experiment or draft the tiny deliverable.\n  - High: ship it and collect feedback.\n- When the “dry hole” hits: use the 10‑minute rule, cut the task in half, or switch to the smallest next step (one email, one prototype, one edit).\n- Feedback loop (15 min each Friday): What did I ship? What felt energizing? What did someone thank me for? Keep a one‑line log. Keep what earns thank‑yous; drop what doesn’t.\n- Optional: document‑as‑you‑build (honest, useful notes/shorts). That scratches the “connect with people” itch without needing it to be The Passion yet.\n\nSide note: if that empty/heavy feeling sticks most days for 2+ weeks or messes with sleep/appetite, consider a quick screening (PHQ‑9/GAD‑7) or talking to a pro. No shame—sometimes it’s fuel, sometimes it’s a flag.\n\nNewport’s framing + small bets will let you test physical sciences, econ, or self‑help content in tiny, honest, impact‑oriented ways—exactly the conditions where passion tends to grow.",
        "interv2_best_human": "I’d recommend So Good They Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport. Do not chase passion first. Build skills via deliberate practice, earn autonomy, then passion grows.

        "interv1_gpt4o": "I hear you on that “why am I here” feeling—totally normal. Finding your passion can be a journey, and it’s great that you’re exploring different areas. Since you mentioned a past interest in physical sciences, maybe revisiting that could reignite some excitement. You could start by taking an online course or joining a local science club to see if it still sparks your interest. Also, your skills in problem-solving and creating could be a great fit for fields like data analysis or product development, where you can see the impact of your work. As for your idea about self-help videos or daily routines on YouTube, it sounds promising! It could be a way to connect with people and share your journey, which aligns with your values. Just start small, maybe with a few videos, and see how it feels. If you do, be transparent about what worked/what didn’t—fits your honesty value. Remember, finding your passion is often about trying new things and being open to where they might lead.\n\nTiny starter (now): set a 3‑minute timer; list 3 “curiosity breadcrumbs” from this week, pick one, and run a micro‑test.\n\n30s/5min/20min:\n- 30s: jot one question you’d love to answer.\n- 5min: outline a 3‑step test.\n- 20min: do step 1 and ship it (unlisted upload/share results).\n\nWhy: small experiments beat overthinking—your energy during/after is the best compass.\n\nIf you stall, shrink the step and try again tomorrow.\n\nFeedback: track energy 1–5 + “continue? Y/N” after each test for 1 week; review on Sunday.",
        "interv2_gpt4o": "Since physical sciences was the last thing that lit you up, sample it again. Your YouTube idea can also help you connect while staying true to your honesty value.\n\nNow stop waiting for clarity and run a four week passion sprint. Pick two or three paths such as physical sciences, data analysis, and science communication on YouTube. Do one mini project per path in a week. Finish one physics module with a short summary, analyze a public dataset and post a brief writeup, record three short videos. Each week, score the paths on energy before and after, integrity fit, connection, and long term pull, and do two or three informational interviews for each. At week four, review the scores and conversations and choose one to double down on.\n\nSince sales and customer service felt empty and research without implementation tired you, bias toward paths where you build and share outcomes."

She wanted us to stay \"friends,\" but I said no. Even if it hurt me so fucking bad. The thing is that I felt safe during her. I showed too much emotion. I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore.

Tiny starter today: set a 3‑minute timer, breathe in 4/out 6, and write one sentence: “Today I will ____.” Labeling feelings + slow breathing lowers your body’s alarm and gives you a gap before you act. Even just 5–10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and learn to manage them better. Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal.

No TikTok/IG/FB—nothing that lets me mindlessly scroll. If deleting is too much, try app limits, move apps off your home screen, grayscale your phone, and keep it in another room while you work. Cutting that variable-reward loop gives my brain back some start-up energy.\n2. When I’m unmotivated, I ask, “What is something tiny I can do in 2 minutes?” Permission to stop after 2. Examples: unload the dishwasher, open the deck and add slide titles, put 5 things away. Tiny wins lower the “activation energy” and create momentum. If I stall, I set a 3-minute timer and do anything until it beeps.\n3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a mess, I say aloud, “Don’t put it down—put it away.” On low-energy days I scale it to “put one thing away,” or I use a small landing tray by the door. It prevents mess from snowballing and saves future me time.\n\nStart now (≤5 min):\n- Put your phone on a charger in another room.\n- Set a 3-minute timer.\n- Do one micro-task (put 5 items away, or open the meeting doc and add the headers).\n- When the timer ends, stop. That’s a win. Optional: run one more round.\n\nIf/when it falls apart: use an if–then. “If I catch myself scrolling, then I dock the phone and stand up.” Miss a day? Don’t miss two—restart with one 2-minute task. Keep a tiny “done list” (aim for 3 checkmarks/day) and do a 5-minute weekly “what worked/what got in the way?” tweak.\n\nAlso, the book Atomic Habits is slowly changing my life. It reminded me it’s not a lack of goals/motivation—it’s a lack of good systems. These small systems make the mindset follow.\n\nIf low mood/no interest, sleep/appetite changes, or lifelong focus issues stick around, consider screening for depression/ADHD or talking to a pro—support helps.\n\nYou’re not alone, and this is a great sub for it.

When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself \"What is something small I can do right now?\" This has helped me feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I'm not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in one go, but I can at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something.

This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud \"Don't put it down, put it away.\" This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place.\n\nMaybe these will help you move forward. It’s a small start.\n\nAlso, the book Atomic Habits is slowly but surely changing my life and making even these tiny gains happen. I recommend running to get it.

        "interv1_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but the good news is that you're already taking the first step by reaching out for advice. Totally get it—when you can skim by, urgency stays low and overwhelm takes over. Here's a simple approach to get started:\n\nRight now: set a 3-minute timer, write one must-do for today, and do the first 2 minutes of it.\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task that you can complete today. It could be as simple as making your bed or organizing your desk. The key is to build momentum with small wins. Small wins quiet overwhelm and make the next step easier.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time. Use a planner or an app to keep track of your tasks and prioritize them. If you’re stuck, pick from this menu: 30s—write the next tiny step; 5 min—clear your desk/send one message; 20 min—one focused block on a single task.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and leisure. Consistency is crucial in building discipline. Start with just one 20‑min block at the same time each day; add more later.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media. During focus blocks, put your phone in another room and use Do Not Disturb.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process. If you slip, do a quick reset: 60s breathe, pick one micro‑task, 2‑minute timer, and move on.\n\nQuick feedback loop: track how many 5–20 min focus blocks you complete each day for 7 days; review on Sunday and adjust.\n\nThis subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes. Keep pushing forward, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You've got this!",

      "body": "\nI am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it’s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. \nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\nIs it too much to ask ? Please help.\nAlso, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.",

        "interv1_best_human": "Totally get it—juggling work, cooking, and chores solo is a lot.\n\nCook in batches for 2/3 days. It saves a good chunk of time and headspace. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.\n\nTo make this even easier:\n- Use a pressure cooker/one‑pot: make a big dal/khichdi or veg pulao + one dry sabzi. Skip rotis on weekdays and do rice to cut time.\n- Make one onion‑tomato masala base on the weekend; freeze in cubes. Drop a cube = curry in minutes.\n- Set defaults: pick 2 breakfasts + 2 dinners and just rotate this week (e.g., oats/eggs; poha; dal‑chawal + sabzi; veg pulao + raita). Fewer decisions = less mental load.\n- Automate groceries: keep a repeat cart on BigBasket/Zepto and reorder weekly; buy staples in bulk, fresh produce 2x/week.\n- Dishes: clean‑as‑you‑cook, soak pans while you eat, 10‑min timer to reset the kitchen. If you can, consider dish‑only help 3–4x/week or a weekly cleaner via app—minimal management, big payoff.\n- 5‑min starter today: write your 2 breakfasts + 2 dinners, add ingredients to cart, schedule delivery.\n- When tired: eggs + toast, curd rice, or poha with frozen peas. Done is done.\n- Tiny workout: 10 minutes with your tea; lay out mat/shoes at night.\n- Track one simple metric: number of home‑cooked meals this week; adjust next week based on what actually happened.\n\nNot too much to ask—you’re just making it simpler and repeatable.",

        "interv1_gpt4o": "Totally valid — setting up your own place and cooking solo is a lot at once.\n\nManaging work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week. Tiny start (do this now): set a 5‑minute timer and list 3 “default dinners” (e.g., dal+rice+sabzi, egg bhurji+roti, veg stir‑fry) and a recurring staples list in Notes; set a weekly auto‑order on your grocery app. Use one‑pot/pressure‑cooker recipes so you cook once, eat twice. Defaults + batching reduce decision fatigue.\n\nSince you’re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed. Even 5 minutes counts.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. Clean as you cook, and put dishes to soak while food simmers.\n\nQuick tiers for busy days:\n- 30s: start rice/soak dal or put dishes to soak\n- 5 min: chop one veg + set cooker; tidy one surface\n- 20 min: cook 2 mains (dal + sabzi) for 2–3 meals; quick sweep/mop\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nIf you slip: 60s breathing, one tiny action (wash one pan or 10 squats), and reset—no guilt. For one week, track cooked-at-home dinners and 10‑min tidies; review Sunday night and adjust. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!",

I keep my phone outside of my room (where my desk is) inside my bag by the front door.

It takes me 5 swipes to get to my distracting apps. Definitely helps!\n\nWhy this works: adding friction + removing cues cuts mindless pick‑ups.\n\n2‑minute start right now: move the apps as above, switch your phone to grayscale, and start a 30–45 min Focus/Do Not Disturb session with only essentials allowed.\n\nSince you reach for it when tired, give yourself a default “tired break” before the phone: stand up and sip water, 10 slow breaths, 1–3 min walk/stretch; or time‑box a 5‑minute scroll with a timer, then back to the task.\n\nIf you need your phone nearby, scale the friction: light = face‑down out of reach; medium = across the room; hard = in the bag by the door. If you bypass limits, add an app‑limit passcode (or let a friend set it).\n\nTrack and iterate: turn on Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing; watch pickups or minutes and aim to shave ~10% per week.

That's called the present bias. The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the \"pain\" associated with those.\n\nFor bad habits, discipline helps, but design works better:\n\n- Map the roots: when/where do you smoke, order food, or spend? Note the emotion/context (tired after work, bored, anxious, knee hurting).\n- Swap the action: smoking/eating signal “I’m safe.” You can get a similar signal from chewing gum, tea, crunchy veg, hot shower, or a quick call/text to someone. Keep the alternative where the habit happens.\n- Add friction to the old, remove friction from the new: move Uber Eats off your home screen, log out, and delete saved cards; keep cigs out of sight; keep ready-to-eat decent food visible (eggs, yogurt, soup, frozen veg).\n\nTiny step right now (≤5 min): log out of Uber Eats and delete the saved payment; put a pack of gum where you usually decide to order. Drink a glass of water and try to sleep.\n\nWhen-then plan for urges (handles slip-ups): “When I want to order, then I eat toast/banana and set a 10‑min timer. If I still want it, I can order.” You get a win even if you order.\n\nScale it based on energy:\n- Low: pick up 5 items in your room; delay first cigarette 10 min with gum; 3 minutes of knee-friendly movement (seated leg raises/ankle pumps).\n- Medium: one default cheap meal (eggs + toast/soup + frozen veg); skip morning Uber once by leaving 15 min earlier; 10‑min tidy.\n- High: plan 2–3 simple meals; book a GP/physio for your knee and a quit‑smoking chat; set a tiny auto-transfer after payday.\n\nSpending/gaming laptop: use a 72‑hour rule for big buys. If after 72 hours (and a quick budget check) you still want it, decide then.\n\nTrack one number for a week: count “reps” of better choices (delays, swaps, skipped orders). Do a 10‑min weekly check-in: what helped, what didn’t, one tweak for next week.\n\nIf thoughts about dying start feeling heavy, sleep stays wrecked, or you feel stuck, loop in a pro (GP can screen for depression/anxiety/ADHD, help with pain, smoking, and eating support).

        "interv2_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Making the harder but better choice often starts with small, manageable steps. Start today with one tiny step, or choose a near date like after your next appointment or move. Here are a few ideas that might help.\n\n1. Start small. Pick one area to focus on first. Maybe it's reducing Uber Eats orders or setting a small budget for groceries. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. Set clear goals. Define what better looks like for you. Is it cooking one meal at home per day? Having a tidy room? Write them down and post them on the fridge. Clear goals can guide your actions.\n\n3. Create a routine. Establish a simple daily routine. It could be as basic as waking up at the same time, making your bed, or having a set time for meals. Routines can provide structure and reduce decision fatigue.\n\n4. Accountability. Share your goals with a friend or join a community like this one to keep you accountable. Knowing someone else is rooting for you can help.\n\n5. Be kind to yourself. Change is hard, and setbacks happen. Don't beat yourself up over them. Acknowledge the slip and refocus on your goals.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Track small wins in a simple journal or app. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward. You've got this!"

The trick is to plan for the dip.\n\nDon’t overdo it, and when you’re not feeling fully up to it accept that something is better than nothing. Perfect is the enemy of good. Small wins keep momentum.\n\nFor AM people:\n- Minimum viable workout: a 5‑min “show‑up set” (mobility, brisk walk, 20 squats + 10 pushups). If that’s all you do, it counts.\n- Tier your days: A = full; B = 20–30 min easy; C = 5‑min minimum.

        "interv1_best_human": "Totally normal—lots of people feel a post‑lunch dip. Quick why: food intake (especially fast carbs) bumps blood sugar (transient hyperglycemia); insulin brings it down; that swing can suppress orexin (an alertness signal). There’s also a built‑in circadian lull around 1–3 pm that big/high‑carb meals amplify.\n\nHow to manage it:\n- Keep the carbs but reduce/refine less: smaller servings, more protein/fiber/fat. Eat protein/veg first, carbs last.\n- Move and get light right after eating: 5–10 min brisk walk or light chores standing. Muscles soak up glucose and bright light boosts alertness.\n- Hydrate: a glass of water with/after lunch.\n- Keep bed out of the loop: eat/study away from the bedroom; set a 20–30 min “no bed” window after lunch. If‑then: “If lunch ends, then shoes on + 5‑minute walk.”\n- If you nap, make it a 10–20 min power nap (alarm), ideally not in bed.\n- Caffeine timing: a small coffee/tea right after lunch can help; cut off mid‑afternoon if it hurts sleep.\n\nI skip lunch entirely and have breakfast and an early dinner—works for me, but it’s not for everyone. If you try delaying/skipping, do it only if you feel fine; don’t push through dizziness, and avoid if you have diabetes, a history of disordered eating, or medical guidance to eat regularly.\n\n5‑minute starter today: after lunch, drink a full glass of water and walk outside for 5 minutes before sitting down.\n\nTiny experiment/feedback: for 3 days, try (A) your usual lunch, (B) lower‑carb/higher‑protein, (C) same calories split into two smaller meals 2–3 hours apart. Rate your sleepiness 1–10 one hour after. Keep what drops it by ≥2 points.\n\nIf this is new/severe, you snore/wake unrefreshed, or you’re on meds that cause daytime sleepiness or rebound (antihistamines, some psych meds/stimulants), check with a clinician—iron/B12/thyroid/glucose issues and sleep apnea can worsen the dip.",
        "interv2_best_human": "Food intake, especially carbs, raises blood sugar briefly. Insulin brings it down. One idea is this may lower orexin, which helps keep you alert.\n\nHow to manage this? Go lighter on carbs, add protein and fiber, and keep portions moderate. If choices are limited, eat a smaller amount and include protein if you can. A short walk after lunch or a 10 to 20 minute nap before late afternoon can help. If this is new or severe, or you snore, get it checked. Avoid diet changes that do not fit your health needs.",
        "interv1_gpt4o": "Totally normal — lots of us crash after lunch. Feeling sleepy after lunch is pretty common and can be due to a few reasons. It might be related to what you're eating. Meals high in carbs or sugar can cause a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash, making you feel tired. Try incorporating more protein and healthy fats (and some fiber) into your lunch to see if that helps. Also, consider your portion sizes; eating too much can make you feel sluggish.\n\nAnother thing to look at is your overall sleep quality and quantity. If you're not getting enough rest at night, it can make you more prone to afternoon drowsiness.\n\nQuick starter: right now, drink a glass of water and take a 3–5 minute brisk walk or step into sunlight. Finally, try to get some light physical activity after eating, like a short walk. It can help boost your energy levels and keep you away from the bed. This helps because movement/sunlight boosts alertness and steadier meals prevent a blood-sugar dip during the natural 1–3pm circadian lull.\n\nIf you slip back into bed, set a 15–20 min timer (power nap), then get up and do 60 seconds of movement.\n\nTiny tiers:\n- 30s: stand, big glass of water, stretch\n- 5 min: brisk walk outside or stairs, sunlight\n- 20 min: capped nap or longer walk\n\nFeedback loop: for 7 days, note lunch (carb-heavy vs balanced), movement, and your 2pm energy 1–5; tweak based on patterns.

Overall sleep quality matters, including good deep and REM time.\n\nFor two weeks, try this plan. Lunch with 25 to 30 g protein plus high fiber carbs, smaller portion, and water. Right after eating, take a 10 to 15 minute brisk walk and get bright light. Limit caffeine after about 2 pm. If you still fade, use a 10 to 20 minute power nap rather than 30 to 60. Track your energy each afternoon so you can see what helps.\n\nAlso consider rule outs. See a clinician if you have loud snoring or witnessed apneas, morning headaches, big weight changes, possible iron, B12, thyroid or blood sugar issues, or if meds or alcohol might be factors.\n\nKeep experimenting and stay consistent.

There is no magic formula except getting enough sleep and good nutrition—here’s how to make that practical with WFH:\n\n- First 5‑min fix: drink a glass of water, get bright light on your face (window/outside), then 2 minutes of movement (walk, stairs, air squats). Light + blood flow = quick alertness boost.\n- Sleep: aim 7–9h, same bedtime/wake time, cool/dark room. Delay first coffee 60–90 min after waking, cut caffeine after ~2 pm to protect night sleep and reduce the 11 am crash.\n- Food: go protein + fiber at lunch, smaller portions; avoid huge carb‑heavy meals. Keep a protein/fat snack for 3–4 pm to prevent the post‑lunch dip.\n- Rhythm: front‑load deep work before 11 am; put lighter/admin after lunch. Use 50/10 or 25/5 cycles; stand/walk on calls. If you can, a 10–20 min power nap (or coffee‑nap) helps.\n- Barriers: miss a break? Just restart next hour. On rough days, minimum = water + 2‑min movement each hour.\n- Feedback: for 1 week, note sleep hours, caffeine, meals, and slump times; adjust one variable at a time.\n- Safety: if you’re getting 7–9h and still wiped, or you snore/gasp, get morning headaches, or doze while driving, talk to a doctor (apnea/anemia/thyroid/meds can do this).",

Notice when your energy peaks and put the hardest tasks there, and save lighter tasks for slower periods.\n\nPay attention to diet and hydration, since sleepiness can relate to what you eat or drink.

      "title": "[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.",
      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

Just put one foot in front of the other and don’t give up even when you have the inevitable setback or relapse.\n\n5‑minute move right now: set a 3‑minute timer and write “Today’s 3” on a sticky: 1) body: drink water + 5‑min walk, 2) money/skill: 10 minutes on one task (job app/learning), 3) connection: text one person. Do the first one immediately and put the sticky where you’ll see it.\n\nWhy it works: tiny, visible wins retrain your brain from short dopamine loops (games/booze/scroll) to longer‑term rewards; clarity beats willpower.\n\nMake it fit your energy:\n- Low day: water, 5‑min walk, 10‑min task, one text.\n- Medium: 20‑min focused block, simple meal, 10‑min tidy.\n- High: 45‑min study/apply, workout, call/meet a friend.\n\nIf you slip: do a quick reset ritual (shower, glass of water, 5‑min tidy), then restart Today’s 3. No punishment, just resume.\n\nReduce friction to old habits: uninstall/restrict the worst time‑sink games, move gear out of the bedroom, or keep gaming as a reward after Today’s 3. If an urge hits early, set a 10‑minute timer and do the first task before deciding.\n\nBe present fast: 30‑second box breathing (4‑4‑4‑4) + name 3 things you see, 2 you feel, 1 you hear. When listening: ask 2 questions before giving opinions, then summarize in one sentence (“So what I heard is…”).\n\nExternalize memory: one notebook/notes app. Daily 2‑minute brain‑dump, pick Today’s 3, and save any “good perspective” notes to re‑read each morning.\n\nFeedback loop: at night, score 0–3 (did you hit body/money/connection?). Sunday: glance at the week and tweak.\n\nSafety note: given depression, alcohol use, and the weight‑loss method you mentioned (fasting + drinking), please loop in a doctor/therapist or a free clinic, and consider screening for ADHD. Not medical advice—just care.\n\nYou’re not behind—you’re getting organized. Keep the next step tiny and visible.",
        "interv2_best_human": "Your honesty puts you ahead because many people never do. Own your choices, cut back escapes like gaming, and put one foot in front of the other without giving up when you have a setback or relapse. For a concrete start, set a 5 minute timer and do one task today.",
        "interv1_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss—that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. Given everything you’ve carried, it makes sense to feel behind—you’re not broken, you’re rebuilding. Do this now: set a 3–5 minute timer and write tomorrow’s top 1–3 micro-tasks on a sticky note where you’ll see it.\n\n1) Start small: It’s overwhelming to change everything at once. Pick one or two tiny habits (consistent wake-up, or even 10 minutes of learning). Small wins reduce overwhelm and build momentum.\n\n2) Set clear goals: Write short- and long-term goals, then break each into the very next 5-minute action. Externalizing goals lowers mental noise.\n\n3) Create a routine: Block time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. Use short focus blocks (start with 10–20 minutes) and a consistent wake/sleep.\n\n4) Limit gaming time: Set specific windows and use it as a reward after tasks. A timer app or stashing the console helps create separation.\n\n5) Mindfulness and presence:\n- 30s: box-breathe (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6)\n- 5min: guided breathing or write 5 lines about what you notice\n- 20min: phone-free walk using 5-4-3-2-1 senses\n\n6) Seek support: Friends/family/therapist for accountability. If alcohol/weed/gaming feel hard to control, consider a therapist or peer group.\n\nIf you slip: 60s breathing, one tiny action, forgive yourself, move on. Track for 7 days: days you hit your wake time and number of 10-minute focus blocks; review weekly and adjust. If you’re ever in immediate danger, call local emergency services or 988 (US). You’ve got this!",
        "interv2_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss, that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started. To keep it manageable, pick 3 or 4 of these to start, then add the rest later.\n\n1. Start small. It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. Set clear goals. Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write them down and break them into actionable steps. If writing feels hard, keep it very brief so it is doable. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. Create a routine. Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. Limit gaming time. Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. Mindfulness and presence. Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or mindful breathing. Keep it short and simple, even a minute counts. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. Seek support. Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. You're tackling multiple areas, so pace yourself. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!"

You could live as if today is your first day.\n\nThat's something I tell myself when I get overwhelmed with decisions I've made or my circumstances.\n\nFirst, eat today so your brain can plan.\n- In the US: dial 211 right now (2 minutes) and say, “I need a free meal/food pantry today.” They’ll give you nearby times/addresses. If not in the US, search “food bank/soup kitchen near me.”\n- If calling is hard: go to findhelp.org (library Wi‑Fi works), enter your ZIP > Food > Free Meals/Groceries. Also try “community fridge [your city].”\n- With $1.25, grab the cheapest calories you can (banana/ramen/tortillas) and ask a grocery/bakery for day‑old bread—people say yes more than you think. If a place is closed, try the next on the list.\n\nLike others have said here, connect with social services, reach out to friends and family for help, be genuinely thankful for any generosity you receive to those who share it with you.\n\nNext 48 hours:\n- Apply for SNAP (search “SNAP [your state]”). If you have little/no money, ask for expedited benefits (often within 7 days).\n- Ask 211 for your local workforce center/Goodwill, temp/day‑labor offices—quickest path to same‑week income.\n\nTiny system: each night write 1 thing you did and 1 next step. One small win a day compounds, and if a plan falls through, you already have the next option.\n\nYou can find a job, find purpose and be a blessing to others. It's certainly not too late!! You can look back one day on this time and thank the 37 year old you for making some good decisions. One day at a time, and try to find inner peace along the journey.

Set a timer. If you keep going, great; if not, you still win.\n\nMaybe try to add a couple hobbies to spend 30–60min every day on (or just 5–15 on low‑energy days). Read a book. Maybe learn the guitar or keyboard or another language (free apps/tutorials). Take a bike ride or run/walk every day. Try woodworking or building things.

Just some ideas :)\n\nWhy this helps: tiny, predictable starts kill decision fatigue and build momentum.\n\nMake it easier:\n- Pair it with “after breakfast, before screens” and use a simple rule: YouTube after 1 block.\n- Lay out what you’ll do the night before.\n- If you miss a day, just restart; 5 minutes still counts.\n- Keep a note with 1–3 daily checkmarks; each week keep what was fun and swap the rest.\n\nIf you’re feeling down most days or struggling to get out of bed regularly, let a parent/coach/counselor know.",

Set Small Goals: Try setting daily or weekly goals for yourself. It could be reading a book, writing a short story, or completing a puzzle. Having something to work towards can give your day more structure. Keep them tiny-first (5 pages, 10 minutes, one sketch).\n\n3. Volunteer: Look for local volunteer opportunities. It’s a great way to meet new people, gain experience, and make a positive impact in your community.\n\n4. Explore Nature: If you can, spend some time outdoors. Go for a walk, hike, or bike ride. It’s a great way to clear your mind and get some fresh air.\n\n5. Create a Routine: Even if you don’t have a lot of responsibilities, having a routine can help you feel more productive.
