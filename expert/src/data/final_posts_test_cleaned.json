      "title": "[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.",
      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss—that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, congrats on the 100lb weight loss - that's a massive achievement that shows you're capable of significant change when you put your mind to it. Don't downplay it, even if the method wasn't perfect. You've already proven you can transform yourself.\n\nThe gaming and escapism make total sense given your background. But now you're ready to level up in the real world, and that's going to take breaking things down into smaller, manageable quests rather than trying to solve everything at once.\n\nStart with creating a basic daily structure. Pick 3-4 fixed times each day for essential activities like waking up, eating meals, and going to bed. Stick to these times religiously for 2-3 weeks until they become automatic. This will help ground you in the present moment and give your days some scaffolding to build on.\n\nFor career direction, instead of trying to find your passion immediately, focus on building general workplace skills through any steady job. The goal right now isn't finding your dream career - it's developing consistency, responsibility, and basic professional capabilities. These transfer to any field you eventually choose.\n\nTo improve focus and presence, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes and do just ONE thing during that time. Could be reading, cleaning, job searching, whatever. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back to the task. Start with 20 minutes once per day, then gradually increase. This builds your \"attention muscle\" over time.\n\nYou're not as far behind as you think. Many people reset their lives in their 30s and 40s. The key is to stop comparing yourself to others and focus on taking small, consistent steps forward. You've already shown you can make major changes - now it's about applying that same determination to building the life you want, one day at a time."

        "best_comment": "My time to shine. Insomnia since age 9, been on prescription sleeping meds that mostly do the trick now. But, for short term solutions or when my meds aren’t kicking in:\nThe podcast “sleep with me” is great, literally bores you to sleep with mindless rambling. Or, the podcast “stuff you should know”, and pick a boring topic. And I’d echo the first comment about elevating your legs, even a pillow under the knees. Sometimes when I can’t sleep I try to sleep on the couch, are you able to change your scenery? Sometimes even the floor with pillows is weirdly enough to reset my brain. Another trick I use is to close your eyes and start planning something very far in the future that is non-consequential. Like your wedding day or exactly how you’d lay out a castle if you lived in it. Or, get out of bed and start reading a dry book, realize how tired you are, and get back in bed lol. Follow along to a 5 minute deep breathing video on the floor. An app I like that is very calming is called Monument- a simple puzzle game that has lovely music and colors. Lastly, everybody is human and sometimes rescheduling your morning event is the best thing- people will probably understand. Have some tools in your pocket next time it happens!\n\nEdit: monument valley* is the app",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! Sorry to hear you're having trouble sleeping. It can be really frustrating when you know you need rest but just can't seem to get there. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n1. **Get out of bed for a bit**: Sometimes, just lying there can make it worse. Try getting up and doing something relaxing, like reading a book or listening to calming music, for about 15-20 minutes before trying again.\n\n2. **Limit screen time**: If you haven't already, put away your phone or any screens. The blue light can mess with your sleep cycle.\n\n3. **Breathing exercises**: Focus on deep, slow breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This can help calm your mind and body.\n\n4. **Stay cool and dark**: Make sure your room is cool and dark, which can help signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n5. **Don't stress about it**: Easier said than done, but try not to stress about not sleeping. Sometimes just accepting that you might not get a full night's sleep can help you relax enough to drift off.\n\nFor the future, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help train your body to know when it's time to wind down. Good luck, and I hope you catch some Z's soon!",
        "claude_comment": "Been there - those nights are rough. At this point, trying to force sleep will likely just stress you out more. Since you have 3 hours until wake-up time, your best bet is to accept tonight as a reduced sleep night and focus on getting through tomorrow while setting yourself up better for the next night.\n\nFor right now: Get up and do something calm and low-key for 20-30 minutes (read a book, light stretching, etc) - no screens. Then try lying down again. If sleep comes, great. If not, at least rest your body even if your mind is awake.\n\nFor tomorrow: Stick to your normal wake time no matter what. It'll be tough but pushing through will help reset your sleep schedule. During the day, get some sunlight early, maybe take a short walk. No caffeine after lunch. If you absolutely need to, a 20-minute power nap before 3PM can help, but don't sleep longer or it'll mess up tomorrow night.\n\nFor better sleep going forward: Set a consistent bedtime routine that starts 30-60 minutes before bed. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Regular exercise (but not right before bed) can really help too. If racing thoughts keep you up, try writing them down before bed to get them out of your head.\n\nThe key is not to spiral about one bad night - it happens to everyone. Focus on building good sleep habits over time rather than forcing it in the moment."

      "title": "[Need Advice] How to stop worrying about whether I am intelligent enough to pursue something and just do it?",
      "body": "I’ve been struggling with this for a while now. I’m reaching the stage in my life where I am figuring out what I will be doing with my life, but I struggle to commit to things because I am constantly worried that if I fail, I will have to admit that I am not smart enough.\n\nI want to be able to learn all the things that interest me, but I constantly doubt myself and feel like I may not be good enough. This has led me to limit myself and doubt every decision I make.  I know it’s an immature and damaging mindset to have but I haven’t been able to get rid of it because I am worried that I’ll feel like I wasted my life if I don’t prove to myself that I can excel at what I put my mind to. \n\nEdit: To add onto this a little more, I feel like I am constantly trying to prove to myself that I am intelligent, self aware etc, but then when I can’t do something or figure something out right away, I use it as a way to put myself down and say to myself, “see, you can’t be successful or knowledgeable because you couldn’t do this thing that other people can do easily” \n\nAll advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Id like to thank everyone for their comments and advice. There’s been a lot of helpful advice that I hope I can use to change my mindset and better myself",

        "gpt_comment": "It's totally normal to have doubts about your abilities, but remember that intelligence isn't fixed—it's something you can develop over time. Instead of focusing on whether you're \"smart enough,\" try shifting your mindset to one of growth. Start by setting small, achievable goals in the areas you're interested in. This way, you can build confidence through incremental successes. Also, remember that failure is a part of learning. Everyone struggles at some point, and it's those struggles that often lead to the most growth. Try to view challenges as opportunities to learn rather than as reflections of your worth. Lastly, surround yourself with supportive people who encourage your growth and remind you of your progress. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Your mindset about intelligence is actually holding you back more than any real limitations would. Intelligence isn't fixed - it grows through effort and practice, just like building muscle. Every time you struggle with something new, you're literally making your brain stronger and more capable.\n\nInstead of viewing struggle as proof you're not smart enough, try reframing it as proof you're learning. Nobody is born knowing complex things. Even genius physicists had to learn basic addition first. The people you think are doing things \"easily\" have usually just put in hours of practice you didn't see.\n\nHere's what helped me break this cycle: Start with small challenges where failure has low stakes. Pick up a new hobby or skill that interests you, but isn't tied to your career or identity. When you mess up (which you will), notice that the world doesn't end. Keep a log of your progress to see how you improve over time.\n\nThe truth is, success comes more from persistence than natural talent. Being willing to be bad at something temporarily is actually a sign of intelligence - it means you understand that mastery takes time. Smart people aren't people who \"just get it\" immediately, they're people who keep going even when it's difficult.\n\nStop trying to prove your intelligence and start proving your dedication instead. Intelligence without action accomplishes nothing. Action, even with average intelligence, can accomplish amazing things. Pick something that excites you and commit to showing up for it consistently, regardless of how smart you feel on any given day."
