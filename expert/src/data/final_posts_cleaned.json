      "title": "[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.",
      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss—that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, congrats on the 100lb weight loss - that's a massive achievement that shows you're capable of significant change when you put your mind to it. Don't downplay it, even if the method wasn't perfect. You've already proven you can transform yourself.\n\nThe gaming and escapism make total sense given your background. But now you're ready to level up in the real world, and that's going to take breaking things down into smaller, manageable quests rather than trying to solve everything at once.\n\nStart with creating a basic daily structure. Pick 3-4 fixed times each day for essential activities like waking up, eating meals, and going to bed. Stick to these times religiously for 2-3 weeks until they become automatic. This will help ground you in the present moment and give your days some scaffolding to build on.\n\nFor career direction, instead of trying to find your passion immediately, focus on building general workplace skills through any steady job. The goal right now isn't finding your dream career - it's developing consistency, responsibility, and basic professional capabilities. These transfer to any field you eventually choose.\n\nTo improve focus and presence, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes and do just ONE thing during that time. Could be reading, cleaning, job searching, whatever. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back to the task. Start with 20 minutes once per day, then gradually increase. This builds your \"attention muscle\" over time.\n\nYou're not as far behind as you think. Many people reset their lives in their 30s and 40s. The key is to stop comparing yourself to others and focus on taking small, consistent steps forward. You've already shown you can make major changes - now it's about applying that same determination to building the life you want, one day at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share your story and acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve. First, let's give you credit for recognizing your patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. It's also great that you've made progress in some areas, like losing 100lbs, which shows you're capable of achieving your goals when you set your mind to it.\n\nTo start building discipline and structure, I'd recommend starting small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, focus on creating a daily routine that includes time blocks for self-care, learning, and productivity. You can begin by setting aside 30 minutes each morning for journaling or meditation to help clear your mind and set intentions for the day.\n\nSince you mentioned struggling with scatter-brained thoughts and memory recall, consider using a planner or app to stay organized and keep track of your tasks and goals. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks can also help you build momentum and confidence.\n\nTo become more present and aware of your surroundings, try incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as taking short walks or doing a few minutes of deep breathing exercises. You can also practice active listening by focusing on the person speaking to you, maintaining eye contact, and asking open-ended questions to encourage meaningful conversations.\n\nRemember that personal growth is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - celebrate your small wins, and use them as motivation to keep moving forward. You've got this, and it's never too late to make a positive change in your life.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're even writing this post shows you're ready to make a change, and that's huge. You've already lost 100lbs, even if you feel conflicted about how you did it, that's still a massive accomplishment. Give yourself some credit for that!\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed when you feel behind, so let's break it down. Forget about comparing yourself to your friends. Everyone's on their own timeline. Focus on small, consistent steps.\n\nSince you're struggling with structure, start with ONE thing. Maybe it's waking up at the same time every day, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill on Khan Academy. Just one thing, and build from there. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight.\n\nAbout the memory issues and losing perspective, try journaling. Write down those insights as soon as you have them. Even just a few sentences can help you remember and revisit those ideas later.\n\nTo be more present, try mindfulness exercises. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through short meditations. Even just 5 minutes a day can make a difference. When you find your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath or your surroundings.\n\nAs for finding a career path, don't put so much pressure on yourself to find the \"perfect\" thing right away. Experiment! Try volunteering, taking online courses, or shadowing someone in a field you're curious about. The goal is to explore and learn, not to find the ultimate answer immediately.\n\nYou've got this. It's a journey, not a race. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward.\n"

But, for short term solutions or when my meds aren’t kicking in:\nThe podcast “sleep with me” is great, literally bores you to sleep with mindless rambling. Or, the podcast “stuff you should know”, and pick a boring topic. And I’d echo the first comment about elevating your legs, even a pillow under the knees. Sometimes when I can’t sleep I try to sleep on the couch, are you able to change your scenery? Sometimes even the floor with pillows is weirdly enough to reset my brain. Another trick I use is to close your eyes and start planning something very far in the future that is non-consequential. Like your wedding day or exactly how you’d lay out a castle if you lived in it. Or, get out of bed and start reading a dry book, realize how tired you are, and get back in bed lol. Follow along to a 5 minute deep breathing video on the floor. An app I like that is very calming is called Monument- a simple puzzle game that has lovely music and colors. Lastly, everybody is human and sometimes rescheduling your morning event is the best thing- people will probably understand. Have some tools in your pocket next time it happens!\n\nEdit: monument valley* is the app",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! Sorry to hear you're having trouble sleeping. It can be really frustrating when you know you need rest but just can't seem to get there. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n1. **Get out of bed for a bit**: Sometimes, just lying there can make it worse. Try getting up and doing something relaxing, like reading a book or listening to calming music, for about 15-20 minutes before trying again.\n\n2. **Limit screen time**: If you haven't already, put away your phone or any screens. The blue light can mess with your sleep cycle.\n\n3. **Breathing exercises**: Focus on deep, slow breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This can help calm your mind and body.\n\n4. **Stay cool and dark**: Make sure your room is cool and dark, which can help signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n5. **Don't stress about it**: Easier said than done, but try not to stress about not sleeping. Sometimes just accepting that you might not get a full night's sleep can help you relax enough to drift off.\n\nFor the future, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help train your body to know when it's time to wind down. Good luck, and I hope you catch some Z's soon!",
        "claude_comment": "Been there - those nights are rough. At this point, trying to force sleep will likely just stress you out more. Since you have 3 hours until wake-up time, your best bet is to accept tonight as a reduced sleep night and focus on getting through tomorrow while setting yourself up better for the next night.\n\nFor right now: Get up and do something calm and low-key for 20-30 minutes (read a book, light stretching, etc) - no screens. Then try lying down again. If sleep comes, great. If not, at least rest your body even if your mind is awake.\n\nFor tomorrow: Stick to your normal wake time no matter what. It'll be tough but pushing through will help reset your sleep schedule. During the day, get some sunlight early, maybe take a short walk. No caffeine after lunch. If you absolutely need to, a 20-minute power nap before 3PM can help, but don't sleep longer or it'll mess up tomorrow night.\n\nFor better sleep going forward: Set a consistent bedtime routine that starts 30-60 minutes before bed. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Regular exercise (but not right before bed) can really help too. If racing thoughts keep you up, try writing them down before bed to get them out of your head.\n\nThe key is not to spiral about one bad night - it happens to everyone. Focus on building good sleep habits over time rather than forcing it in the moment.",
        "llama_comment": "When you're lying awake and can't seem to fall asleep, it can be really frustrating, especially with an early wake-up call looming. One thing that might help is trying to relax your body and mind - sometimes our brains can get stuck in overdrive when we're stressed about not sleeping. You could try some gentle stretches, deep breathing exercises, or even just focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. If your mind starts racing, acknowledge the thoughts but gently let them go without engaging with them. It might also be helpful to avoid screens for a bit, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep. Since you've only got a few hours left before your alarm goes off, you could also try setting a timer for 20-30 minutes and telling yourself you'll just rest during that time - sometimes taking the pressure off of actually falling asleep can help your body relax enough to drift off. Not ideal, I know, but hopefully something in there helps you catch a bit of sleep before your wake-up time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, that sucks. Been there. Honestly, with only 3 hours left, trying to force sleep might just stress you out more. Here's what I'd do *right now*:\n\nFirst, get out of bed. Don't associate your bed with being awake and frustrated. Go to another room, dim the lights, and do something *really* boring and relaxing. Think: reading a physical book (not a screen!), gentle stretching, or listening to a sleep story. No phone, no bright lights, no mentally stimulating activities.\n\nSecond, when you start feeling even a little bit sleepy again, head back to bed.\n\nFor the long term, this sounds like a sleep schedule issue. Start thinking about a consistent bedtime routine. Things like cutting caffeine after noon, making your bedroom dark and cool, and winding down with a relaxing activity an hour before bed can make a huge difference. Maybe even try a sleep app to track your sleep and see if you can identify any patterns. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "I’ve been struggling with this for a while now.

        "gpt_comment": "It's totally normal to have doubts about your abilities, but remember that intelligence isn't fixed—it's something you can develop over time. Instead of focusing on whether you're \"smart enough,\" try shifting your mindset to one of growth. Start by setting small, achievable goals in the areas you're interested in. This way, you can build confidence through incremental successes. Also, remember that failure is a part of learning. Everyone struggles at some point, and it's those struggles that often lead to the most growth. Try to view challenges as opportunities to learn rather than as reflections of your worth. Lastly, surround yourself with supportive people who encourage your growth and remind you of your progress. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Your mindset about intelligence is actually holding you back more than any real limitations would. Intelligence isn't fixed - it grows through effort and practice, just like building muscle. Every time you struggle with something new, you're literally making your brain stronger and more capable.\n\nInstead of viewing struggle as proof you're not smart enough, try reframing it as proof you're learning. Nobody is born knowing complex things. Even genius physicists had to learn basic addition first. The people you think are doing things \"easily\" have usually just put in hours of practice you didn't see.\n\nHere's what helped me break this cycle: Start with small challenges where failure has low stakes. Pick up a new hobby or skill that interests you, but isn't tied to your career or identity. When you mess up (which you will), notice that the world doesn't end. Keep a log of your progress to see how you improve over time.\n\nThe truth is, success comes more from persistence than natural talent. Being willing to be bad at something temporarily is actually a sign of intelligence - it means you understand that mastery takes time. Smart people aren't people who \"just get it\" immediately, they're people who keep going even when it's difficult.\n\nStop trying to prove your intelligence and start proving your dedication instead. Intelligence without action accomplishes nothing. Action, even with average intelligence, can accomplish amazing things. Pick something that excites you and commit to showing up for it consistently, regardless of how smart you feel on any given day.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and fear of not meeting your own expectations. One thing that might help is to focus on the process of learning and improvement, rather than the end result.

Remember that intelligence and ability are not fixed traits, but rather things that can be developed over time with practice and effort.\n\nIt might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate your successes along the way. This can help build confidence and reinforce the idea that you're capable of learning and growing. Additionally, try to practice self-compassion when you encounter obstacles or setbacks - instead of using them as evidence of your supposed lack of intelligence, remind yourself that everyone faces challenges and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nLastly, consider the idea that \"good enough\" is, well, good enough. You don't have to be perfect or excel at everything you try in order to be worthy or successful. By letting go of some of that pressure and expectation, you might find that you're more free to explore your interests and pursue your passions without getting bogged down in self-doubt.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That fear of not being \"smart enough\" can be a real motivation killer. It sounds like you're stuck in a perfectionist trap, where anything less than immediate success feels like proof of inadequacy.\n\nHere's a thought: reframe \"failure\" as learning. Seriously. Every time you stumble, instead of beating yourself up, ask \"Okay, what did I learn from this?\" Even the most brilliant people fail all the time; the difference is they use those failures to get better.\n\nAlso, try breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of thinking \"I need to master X,\" think \"I'm going to spend 30 minutes learning the basics of X today.\" Small wins build momentum and confidence.\n\nFinally, be kinder to yourself. You're not going to be an expert overnight. Give yourself permission to be a beginner, to make mistakes, and to learn along the way.

If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

Many offer sliding scale payments if cost is a concern.\n\nFor the career situation - journalism skills are actually pretty versatile. Writing, research, communication, and critical thinking are valuable in many fields. Have you considered content marketing, technical writing, or corporate communications? These often pay better than traditional journalism and have more job openings. Your degree isn't useless - it just might need to be applied differently than you originally planned.\n\nStart small with building discipline. Pick one tiny goal for tomorrow - maybe it's applying to one job, taking a 10-minute walk, or writing for 15 minutes. Something achievable. Then do it again the next day. Small wins build momentum.\n\nThe debt feels overwhelming now, but it's manageable with the right approach. Look into income-based repayment plans if you haven't already. They can make monthly payments more reasonable while you work on increasing your income.\n\nYou're 26 - you have time to reshape your path. Many successful people didn't figure things out until their 30s or later. Focus on taking one small step forward each day. That's how real change happens.\n\nIf you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to crisis resources. You matter, and there are people who want to help.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles like this, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. First, let's acknowledge that you're not a failure - you're 26, and many people take time to figure out their path in life. It's okay to not have it all together yet. \n\nIt sounds like you're feeling really stuck, and that's understandable given your situation. One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try focusing on what you can do today or this week to move forward. This could be as simple as updating your resume, applying to a few jobs, or reaching out to someone in a field that interests you.\n\nRegarding your mental health, it's great that you're already taking steps to manage your symptoms with medication. Have you considered talking to a therapist who can help you work through some of these feelings and develop coping strategies? Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. \n\nIn terms of turning your life around, it might be helpful to explore different areas that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your degree. You could try volunteering, taking online courses, or attending workshops to learn new skills and meet people in different fields. This can help you build confidence and find things that you enjoy, which can be a great motivator.\n\nLastly, please don't give up on yourself. You've already taken the first step by reaching out for help, and that takes a lot of courage. There are people who care about you and want to support you, and there are resources available to help you get back on your feet. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like things are tough - you got this.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's easy to feel overwhelmed, but turning things around is totally possible, even if it seems impossible right now.\n\nFirst, about the mental health stuff: it's great you're on antidepressants, but if they're just keeping you \"above water,\" it might be worth talking to your doctor about adjusting the dosage or trying something different. Finding the right medication can make a massive difference. Also, have you considered therapy? Talking to someone might help you process those thoughts and develop coping mechanisms.\n\nAs for the rest, let's break it down. You feel stuck with your job and degree. Okay, journalism might not be the golden ticket right now, but it taught you skills – writing, research, communication. Those are valuable! Think about how you can leverage them. Maybe content writing, social media management, or even technical writing. Look for online courses or certifications in those areas – many are free or low-cost.\n\nRegarding the \"failure\" label, ditch it. You're 26. That's young! Plenty of people change careers, learn new skills, and find their passion later in life. It's not a race. Start small. Pick one thing you want to improve – maybe it's learning a new skill, maybe it's exercising more, maybe it's just reading a book a week. Focus on that one thing and build momentum.\n\nLiving with your parents isn't ideal, but it's a reality for many people these days. Use this time to your advantage. Save money, learn new skills, and plan your next move. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nFinally, about having \"zero interest\": that's probably not true. Everyone is interested in something. Think back to what you enjoyed as a kid, or what topics you find yourself reading about online. Explore those interests! Join a club, take a class, volunteer. You might discover a hidden passion.\n\nThe key is to start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. You've got this.\n"

I love staying awake at night, and I naturally tend to fall asleep around 2 to 3 AM and wake up around 10-11AM feeling well-rested.

How do you force yourself out of bed when all you feel like doing is sleeping for “five more minutes.”\n\nEdit: just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to contribute such helpful comments!

Over the past year I’ve decided to get my life in order. Didn’t especially focus on my sleep schedule issues, but on my general well being. I listen to my body more, I rest more and quit drinking, I take the time to do painting / drawing, whatever creative activity calms me down. Cut out all social media except for Reddit sometimes, never at night. I started feeling more relaxed in the evenings, and I came to enjoy reading a book at 10pm as much as I used to enjoy binge watching Netflix all night. Being far from screens, I get tired, I fall asleep. Naturally, I wake up earlier and earlier every week, step by step. \n\nMy point is, I’ve used every technic I could find to become a morning person before, and it never worked (I was late EVERY day to my job for 4 years). It is only when I started taking care of myself globally and on a more spiritual level too that it has changed. Feeling good and proud about yourself is the best way to actually want to get out of bed and face the day.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! Transitioning from a night owl to an early riser can be challenging, but it's definitely doable with some gradual changes. Start by adjusting your bedtime in small increments, like 15-30 minutes earlier each night, until you reach your desired wake-up time. Consistency is key, so try to stick to the same sleep schedule even on weekends. \n\nCreating a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, meditating, or taking a warm shower. In the morning, place your alarm clock across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. Once you're up, expose yourself to natural light as soon as possible to help reset your internal clock.\n\nLastly, give yourself something to look forward to in the morning, like a delicious breakfast or a few minutes of quiet time with a cup of coffee. It might take some time, but with patience and persistence, you'll likely find it easier to wake up early and start your day on a productive note. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "The key to becoming an early riser isn't about forcing yourself - it's about gradually shifting your sleep schedule and creating the right conditions. Since you naturally fall asleep at 2-3 AM, try moving your bedtime earlier by 15-20 minutes every few days. This gradual approach is much more sustainable than trying to suddenly jump to an early schedule.\n\nMake your morning routine something to look forward to. Maybe it's a really good coffee, a peaceful breakfast, or some activity you enjoy. Having a compelling reason to get up makes a huge difference.\n\nFor the actual wake-up part: Put your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. Once you're up, immediately open your curtains or step outside - natural light helps reset your circadian rhythm. The first 5 minutes are the hardest, but if you can push through those, it gets much easier.\n\nMost importantly, be consistent with your sleep schedule, even on weekends. Your body craves routine. If you stick to roughly the same sleep and wake times, your internal clock will eventually adjust and waking up early will feel more natural.\n\nRemember that feeling groggy when you first wake up is normal for everyone - it's called sleep inertia and typically lasts 15-30 minutes. Power through it, and you'll feel more alert soon enough.",
        "llama_comment": "One strategy that might help is to start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually working your way up to your desired wake-up time of 6 AM. This can make the transition less jarring and allow your body to adjust. Additionally, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can signal to your brain that it's time to sleep, making it easier to wake up in the morning. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, and opt for relaxing activities like reading or meditation instead. When your alarm goes off, get out of bed immediately and expose yourself to some natural light - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make you feel more alert. It might also be helpful to have a reason to get out of bed, whether that's a morning workout, a quiet moment of reflection, or a cup of coffee, so find something that motivates you to start your day on a positive note. Remember, it may take some time for your body to adjust, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey! I totally get the night owl struggle. Shifting your sleep schedule is tough, but definitely doable. Here's what's worked for me and others I know:\n\nFirst, don't try to jump straight to 6 AM. That's a recipe for misery. Instead, shift your wake-up time by 15-30 minutes *earlier* each day. This gradual approach lets your body adjust.\n\nSecond, create a compelling reason to get out of bed. \"Being more productive\" is a good goal, but what *specific* activity will you do at 6 AM that you're actually excited about? Maybe it's a workout, a quiet coffee and reading session, or working on a passion project. Having something you *want* to do makes a huge difference.\n\nThird, optimize your sleep environment. Make sure your room is dark, quiet, and cool. A consistent bedtime routine (even on weekends!) signals to your body that it's time to wind down.\n\nFourth, the \"five more minutes\" trap is real. Try putting your alarm clock across the room so you *have* to get out of bed to turn it off. Once you're up, immediately expose yourself to bright light (sunlight is best) to help suppress melatonin.\n\nFinally, be patient and consistent. It takes time to rewire your internal clock. Don't get discouraged if you slip up occasionally. Just get back on track the next day. Good luck!\n"

One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Sometimes the thought of doing a big task can be overwhelming, but if you just focus on starting with a tiny part of it, it can be easier to get going. Also, try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes and commit to working for that short period. Often, once you start, you'll find it easier to keep going. Lastly, consider creating a routine or schedule that incorporates your tasks at the same time each day. This can help make the action feel more automatic and less reliant on how you're feeling in the moment. Keep at it, and remember, building discipline is a gradual process!",
        "claude_comment": "The \"I don't feel like it\" feeling is totally normal - but here's the thing: discipline isn't about feeling like doing something. It's about doing it anyway. Think of it like brushing your teeth - you probably don't wake up excited to do it, but you do it because it needs to be done.\n\nStart by accepting that the feeling will be there. Don't fight it or try to push it away with affirmations. Instead, acknowledge it and then take action regardless. \"Yep, I don't feel like doing this right now. I'm going to start anyway.\"\n\nA practical approach that works well is the 2-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll work for just 2 minutes. That's it. Usually, once you start, you'll find it easier to continue. If after 2 minutes you still want to stop, you can - but often you'll have built enough momentum to keep going.\n\nAnother effective strategy is to break down your work into smaller, less daunting chunks. Instead of \"I need to study for 3 hours,\" try \"I'm going to read one page\" or \"I'll solve just this one problem.\" This makes the task feel more manageable and gives you small wins to build on.\n\nRemember: your feelings don't have to drive your actions. They're just passengers along for the ride - you're still the one steering the car.",
        "llama_comment": "I think the key here is to stop trying to ignore or fight the \"I don't feel like it\" feeling, and instead learn to acknowledge and work with it. Rather than relying on motivation or willpower, which can be fleeting, try building habits and routines that make it easier to get started on your work. For example, break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and create a schedule that you can stick to. That way, when the \"I don't feel like it\" feeling hits, you can tell yourself that you just need to do this one small task, and then take it from there. It's also important to recognize that it's normal to not always feel like doing something, and that it doesn't mean you're not capable of doing it. By focusing on building discipline and habits, rather than trying to muster up motivation, you can make progress even when you don't feel like it. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons behind your \"I don't feel like it\" feeling - is it boredom, fear, or something else? Once you understand what's driving that feeling, you can develop strategies to address it and stay on track.",

It sounds like you're trying to brute force your way through it, which can work sometimes, but it's definitely not sustainable.\n\nInstead of ignoring the feeling, maybe try acknowledging it, but then shrinking the task. Like, if you're supposed to work for an hour, tell yourself you'll just do 5 minutes. Seriously. Set a timer. Usually, once you get started, that initial resistance fades, and you'll keep going. If you *really* still don't feel like it after 5 minutes, then stop! But you'll probably find you're already in the flow.\n\nAlso, make sure you're not burnt out. Are you getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks? Sometimes that \"I don't feel like it\" feeling is your body telling you it needs something else. Good luck!\n"

I am saving this post to revisit it and I hope this collection of great thoughts will help others too! 💛",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I will give you my advice, but I think I should provide some context to help you decide what is it worth.\n\nI am a doctor currently finishing a dual specialisation in two specialities, one in pathology and one in clinical medicine. I have had to sit a LOT of exams, some of which were among the most stressful and intense experiences of my life. I would have similar anxiety spirals in the lead up to them. Exams are stressful.\n\nBefore each exam, or during each storm of panic, the single most helpful thing I did was breathe. Sit up straight at your desk, close your eyes, and breathe in deeply, hold it for a few seconds, and then out. Google “box breathing” for more detailed techniques. It is amazing how much the simple act of breathing can pull you out of your thoughts, reaffirm you are alive, and that it will all be ok.\n\nThe second most important thing to do is take small steps. Set yourself small, achievable goals. Write a paragraph, or read some text, then break for 5 minutes and have a cup of tea, or some other small, easy reward. Lengthen the amount of time you spend working until you find your mind drifting, then another small break. Small breaks are ok, and essential to remaining productive over a whole session. I do 50 minute sessions, 10 minute breaks, but find the mix that is right for you. If you can only do 25 minutes, that is ok. 25min is > 0 min.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, beware the mental trap of exams. Exams trick you into thinking they are the most important event in your life, and are linked to your worth as a person/student/academic/whatever. They are neither. They are simply another small hurdle in  a very long journey getting you where you want to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps, but regardless, good luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Breathe, small increments, take the long view.\n\nedit: grammar.",

Also, remember that it's okay to ask for help or accountability from friends or study groups. They can provide support and help keep you on track. Lastly, practice self-compassion. It's easy to be hard on yourself, but recognizing your efforts and progress can boost your confidence and reduce stress. Good luck with everything ahead!",
        "claude_comment": "Congrats on passing! What an amazing accomplishment - you pushed through despite the anxiety and proved to yourself that you could do it. Those all-nighters and pushing yourself to keep going even when it felt impossible really paid off.\n\nFor anyone else reading this who's in a similar situation: When you're paralyzed by exam anxiety, start with tiny chunks. Set a timer for just 10 minutes of focused work. Anyone can do 10 minutes. Once you get going, it's easier to keep going. If you need to stop after 10 minutes, that's fine - take a short break and do another 10. \n\nThe key is breaking through that initial wall of panic by making the task feel manageable. Your brain is trying to protect you by avoiding what feels threatening, but you can outsmart it by starting so small it doesn't trigger that fear response.\n\nRemember: You don't need to feel ready or confident to take action. Action comes first, then confidence follows. Just take that first tiny step, then another, then another. Before you know it, you'll have built momentum.\n\nTo the OP - enjoy your well-deserved relief and pride in what you accomplished. You've proven you can push through intense pressure and succeed.

This can make the task less daunting and allow you to build momentum. Additionally, creating a schedule and sticking to it, even when it feels like the smallest step, can help build discipline and confidence.

Having a support system, whether it's online communities like this or friends and family, can provide the encouragement needed to keep moving forward.",

Really lock it in. When the pressure starts building again, try to recall this victory. You *can* get through it.\n\nSecond, break things down even smaller. You mentioned 25-minute focus periods. That's great! Next time, aim for even shorter bursts if needed. 10 minutes of focused work is better than an hour of panicked avoidance. The Pomodoro Technique is your friend here.\n\nThird, be kind to yourself. You're not a machine. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Acknowledge the feeling, but don't let it paralyze you. Maybe try a quick 5-minute meditation or some deep breathing exercises when the panic starts creeping in. There are tons of free apps for that.\n\nFinally, now that you're done, really focus on recovery. Get some sleep, eat well, and do things you enjoy. You earned it! Building better habits is a marathon, not a sprint, and you just finished a tough leg. Time to recharge for the next one. You got this!\n"

One thing that might help is setting small, achievable goals for each interest. Instead of thinking about mastering the drums or becoming a pro dancer, focus on learning one song or one dance routine. This way, you get a sense of accomplishment without feeling overwhelmed. Also, try scheduling specific times in your week dedicated to these activities. Consistency can help build a habit, even if it's just 15 minutes a day. Lastly, it's okay to have multiple interests!

        "claude_comment": "This is a really common pattern - it's called the \"shiny object syndrome\" and tons of people deal with it. The good news is you can work with this tendency instead of fighting against it.\n\nTry setting a minimum commitment period for new interests - say 3 months. During that time, you have to stick with it no matter what, even if something new catches your eye. This helps build follow-through while still letting you explore different things.\n\nAnother approach is to cycle between 2-3 core interests rather than constantly picking up new ones. For example, you could rotate between drums, dance, and one other activity. This way you're still getting variety, but you're building skills over time instead of starting from scratch.\n\nThe key is accepting that it's okay to have multiple interests - you don't have to master everything. But by setting some structure around how you pursue them, you can make meaningful progress while still keeping things fresh and engaging.\n\nFor the immediate situation with dance - try setting specific, achievable goals (like learning one full routine) rather than just practicing randomly. Having concrete targets makes it easier to push through when motivation dips. And if you do end up moving on eventually, that's fine - you'll have accomplished something tangible first.",

One strategy you might consider is setting a \"minimum viable commitment\" for each new interest - instead of diving all-in and risking burnout, try committing to a smaller, manageable goal, like practicing dance for 10-15 minutes each day, or dedicating one day a week to learning. This can help you build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, you might reflect on what draws you to each new interest - is it the creative expression, the challenge, the social aspect? Identifying your underlying motivations can help you find common threads between your various pursuits and potentially transfer skills or habits from one area to another. As for dealing with the regret of not continuing past interests, try to focus on the present and what you can control - rather than wishing you'd stuck with something years ago, think about how you can apply the lessons you learned from those experiences to your current endeavors. Remember that it's okay to have multiple interests and explore different passions - the key is finding a balance that works for you and allows you to make progress without feeling like you're constantly starting over.",

The \"jack of all trades\" thing can feel cool, but also frustrating when you wish you'd stuck with something longer.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is to focus less on the \"obsession\" part and more on building a sustainable habit. Instead of going all-in on dance every day for hours, maybe try scheduling just 30 minutes, 3 times a week. Make it a non-negotiable appointment with yourself. That way, it's less likely to feel overwhelming and you're more likely to stick with it even when the initial excitement fades.\n\nAlso, try to identify *why* you lose interest. Is it the difficulty? The time commitment? Boredom? Once you know the trigger, you can plan for it. If it's difficulty, break down the learning into smaller, more manageable steps. If it's boredom, find ways to make it more engaging – maybe find a dance partner or join a class.\n\nFinally, don't beat yourself up about the past. The fact that you're aware of this pattern is a huge step. Just focus on building better habits *now*, and you'll be surprised at how much progress you can make over time. Good luck!\n"

But it is not just the things i don‘t like doing like studying etc. its also things i really enjoy or that are completely normal to do. I procrastinate on things like getting out of my bed, brushing teeth, going down to drink something, laying in another position when watching a video in bed(actually true :/ ) drawing(which i actually really enjoy doing), walking 3 steps to get lip balm even when my lips are really hurting, sports and so much more. I Basically procrastinate every single thing. And it’s not like im on my phone all the time(well most of the time) but i also procrastinate while doing nothing. And it isn‘t like an „out of sight out of mind“ type more like not doing but really wanting to do it, i feel really really shitty while procrastinating because all im thinking about is what i should be doing right now. This sometimes goes so far that i actually dont sleep at night, i can procrastinate for hours at night watching stupid youtube videos while feeling sick about myself. Then suddenly its 4 at night and i didn‘t do shit, so i tell myself it’s too late now and i basically wasted all that time for nothing at all. My grades are failing hard, i may have to attend this year again and i would have to leave all my friends behind.\n\nI really don‘t know what to do anymore, i managed to read some books like Atomic Habits but i didn‘t do any of the methods. I used to have really good grades when i didn’t need to study as much and i also know that if i just study a can get excelent results but i just don‘t do it. Also if i start i have like an 10 minute motivation boost till i fall back into a depressive state of procrastination. I don‘t know if its adhd or something(ADHD is running in my Family like crazy, my dad is in early retirement because of it, and my brother who was diagnosed as well also has similar problems)\n\nI just feel like im fucking my entire life up because i achive little to nothing every day. Everytime i go to bed i feel like i wasted this day once again.\n\n(Sorry for bad spelling im typing this on my phone and english is my second language)",

        "best_comment": "Same. And I haven't found any way or method that universally, always helps me cope better with this. In a way that makes sense - to be human means to operate in changeable situations, and to not always do what should be done. So the solutions are also going to look different day-to-day and sometimes they won't work. The key thing is to try different stuff, to have lots of different \"tools\" to try in this situation, but even that will not always work. One of the most difficult hurdles is using a tool in the first place, just as you articulate. But, I believe you can do it at least some of the time! I believe you can develop some tools for moment-to-moment use. And hopefully you can find something to help longer-term too (I agree that depression and ADHD are possible underlying things that are happening here).\n\nSome things that help me, to give you an example of what I mean by \"tools\":\n\n-Lots of forgiveness. Actively speaking to myself in a kind, forgiving, compassionate way. It's important because forgiveness clears my energy and creates security in myself, which encourages me to risk trying things that might not work. Plus kindness is the nice thing to do. It's soothing. It's a way to parent myself through difficult feelings. If I do want to be mean to myself, I try to at least do it in a joking or ironic way to make myself laugh in the process. Laughter makes things seem less serious. But generally, I assume if I can't do a task that it means I am feeling vulnerable in some way and need soothing and compassion. I could speak to myself kindly or ask someone else for a hug or something like that.\n\n-Deciding a first action, setting a 5 minute timer, then acting once the timer goes off. It's like that \"countdown\" technique people use to get themselves moving, but with a longer range, to give the subconscious mind time to adjust to the idea. One reason to procrastinate can be a struggle with making transitions between different activities (changing from activity A to activity B). Giving myself a slower pace of change can help me with transitions sometimes at least. And making the signal external to me reduces the work my mind has to do. Often I am thinking \"do it now!\" and I don't act, in fact I feel I can't. But sometimes when the timer goes off 5 minutes after I decided my action, I can act. If not, I can set the timer 1-2 more times to see if it works then. If not, only 15 minutes have elapsed and I know that I tried to find a way out of being trapped and that because this didn't work, I can see that the problem is not going to be easily solved this time.\n\n-\"Wiggle your big toe\". It's a scene in the film Kill Bill where the character must get her legs to work, so she starts with intensive focus on one toe. Can't do a big movement like turning your whole body or sitting up? Try a small one.\n\n-Promise myself a reward and then give it to myself once I have done something. Even something small like putting on the lip balm could count if it's something difficult for you and if thinking about a reward for doing it helps you actually do it. Don't judge what you consider a reward, figure it out and accept it and work with it. (I am food motivated. I loathe the idea of leaving the house as a reward because it feels like a task in itself.)\n\n-Physically changing my location/movements while keeping my mind blank. Don't know why this works, but it does sometimes help me. For example, I was standing up staring down at a whiteboard, trying to get motivation to clean it so I could use it. But I just felt dread and reluctance. Then I made my mind blank, and just sat down next to the whiteboard, only seeing it through my peripheral vision. Pretty quickly, I felt a change internally. Suddenly the task felt doable and I got up and got going with it, no internal \"forcing\" necessary. If I need to clean, making my body just mindlessly pick things up and put them other places can actually get me into the right frame of mind to genuinely start cleaning. It's like, if figuring things out mentally isn't helping, then engage the body first!\n\n-Try and really dissect certain situations for what is creating discomfort, reluctance or dread. This might be extremely difficult (it is for me), so it's not somethingto push - but gently be aware of. For example, I realised I often don't leave bed because I dread being cold. It took me a long time to recognise that, even though it is simple. Judging that doesn't help me - wrapping up warmer while in bed in preparation to leave does. Underlying reasons can be much less obviously connected to problems, though. My therapist guided me through a decision making technique and it starts with \"feel and acknowledge\". Before deciding what you should do, perhaps try to understand yourself in that moment? Only after doing that can you negotiate between your wants and your needs. One way to cultivate awareness of this is to ask yourself whether anything negative has happened recently, that might be affecting your mood, energy or concentration in general. Because those things affect the decisions you make, if you are struggling in the afternoon and in the morning you argued with someone, the struggle might have little to do with the task and everything to do with the argument. Finally, deeper things like fears and insecurities can prevent action - in this case you cannot brute force a solution, but need a gentle set of steps to follow, or an alternative way of looking at the task so that it doesn't feel so scary and important.\n\n-That brings me to ask whether you have received any external support recently? It seems like some of the problems here are self-sustaining in the sense that you feel behind and unable to catch up, which would increase your worries and stresses, which would decrease what you can cope with. Perhaps someone else can help you see the situation in a different light that seems more manageable, could get you some supports so you're not facing it alone? \n\nThese things listed above are just possibilities. And, I am sorry I added much of my own experience - you are your own person and solutions will come from you, not from others. But I do know what it's like to go through this. I hope this post helps you a bit. Please let me know whether anything I said was unclear.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination, and I want to say you're not alone in this. Many people face similar challenges, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about everything you need to do. Try breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if you want to draw, just commit to setting up your drawing space. Once you're there, it might be easier to start.\n\n2. **Set Timers**: Use a timer to work in short bursts, like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break). This can help you get started and maintain focus without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Establishing a daily routine can help reduce decision fatigue. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and schedule time for activities you enjoy and need to do.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you mentioned spending a lot of time on your phone, consider using apps that limit screen time or block distracting sites during certain hours.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If you suspect ADHD might be a factor, it could be helpful to talk to a professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself as you work through this. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Given the family history of ADHD and the symptoms you're describing, getting evaluated by a mental health professional would be a smart first step. But while you work on that, let's focus on some immediate strategies you can use.\n\nStart incredibly small. Like, microscopically small. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE tiny habit - maybe just putting your feet on the floor when you wake up. Don't worry about the full morning routine yet. Just feet on floor. Make it so stupidly easy you can't talk yourself out of it.\n\nThe key is breaking the paralysis cycle. Right now you're stuck in a loop where everything feels overwhelming, so you do nothing, which makes you feel worse, which makes everything feel even more overwhelming. We need to prove to your brain that you can follow through on intentions, even tiny ones.\n\nFor the late night YouTube spiral - install a website blocker that activates at a certain time. Make the decision once, in advance, rather than relying on willpower when you're tired. Even if you don't sleep right away, lying in bed without screens is better than feeding the cycle.\n\nFor studying, try the 5-minute rule. Tell yourself you only have to study for 5 minutes. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you start. If not, that's fine - you still did 5 minutes more than zero. Tomorrow, do 5 minutes again.\n\nThe goal isn't perfection. The goal is to start building evidence that you can do things, even small things. Each tiny win creates momentum. Your brain starts to believe \"I'm someone who follows through\" instead of \"I always procrastinate.\"\n\nTake it one absurdly small step at a time. You don't have to fix everything today. You just have to put your feet on the floor.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and it's affecting all areas of your life. First, let's acknowledge that recognizing the problem is a huge step, so kudos to you for that. It's also great that you've read books like Atomic Habits, even if you haven't implemented the methods yet. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one or two things you want to work on each day. Make a tiny goal for yourself, like \"I'll get out of bed and brush my teeth as soon as I wake up\" or \"I'll study for 10 minutes without any distractions.\" These tiny wins can add up and help build momentum.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention having a 10-minute motivation boost before falling back into procrastination. This could be a clue to working with your energy levels rather than against them. Try breaking down tasks into shorter intervals, like 10-15 minutes of focused work followed by a short break. This might help you stay on track and avoid burnout.\n\nRegarding ADHD, it's definitely worth exploring if you suspect it might be a factor. Talking to a doctor or a therapist could provide valuable insights and help you develop strategies tailored to your needs.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It's clear that you're beating yourself up over procrastination, but remember that everyone struggles with it to some extent. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't give up – keep working on making small changes, and celebrate your tiny wins along the way.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I really get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're stuck in a tough cycle, but it's definitely something you can break.\n\nFirst off, don't beat yourself up too much. Recognizing the problem is the first step. You've already done that!\n\nSince you mentioned Atomic Habits, maybe try REALLY small steps. Like, instead of \"brush teeth,\" it's \"put toothpaste on toothbrush.\" Seriously. Make it ridiculously easy. Once you've done that, the rest of brushing your teeth is way more likely to happen. Same with getting out of bed – maybe just put one foot on the floor. The goal is to lower the activation energy for these tasks.\n\nAlso, about the ADHD thing – definitely worth looking into. Since it runs in your family, talking to a doctor or therapist could be a game-changer. Even if it's not ADHD, they can help you figure out what's going on and develop strategies.\n\nFor the studying, try the Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. It's less daunting than a huge study session, and you might find that 25 minutes turns into more.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix this overnight. Celebrate the small wins, and don't let setbacks derail you completely. You got this!\n"

When it comes to working out, sometimes the changes are happening internally before you see them externally. Try tracking small wins, like lifting a bit more weight or feeling more energetic. As for relationships and goals, it's worth reflecting on whether your expectations are realistic or if there's a small tweak you can make to your approach. Patience is key, and sometimes it's about adjusting your methods rather than overhauling everything. Keep going, and don't be too hard on yourself—every step forward counts, even if it feels small.",
        "claude_comment": "Progress often feels invisible when you're in the thick of it. Think of it like watching grass grow - you won't notice daily changes, but look back after a month and the difference is clear. For working out specifically, try taking progress photos or logging your weights/reps rather than relying on how you feel. Having concrete data helps cut through that discouraging \"nothing's working\" mindset.\n\nAs for feeling like you're failing at multiple things - that's actually pretty normal when building new habits or pursuing goals. Success isn't linear. The key is to break down your larger goals into smaller, measurable chunks. Instead of \"get in shape,\" aim for \"do 3 workouts this week.\" Instead of \"improve relationships,\" maybe it's \"reach out to one friend for coffee.\"\n\nOne thing that helped me was keeping a simple journal where I write down one small win each day, no matter how tiny. Some days it might just be \"got out of bed\" or \"drank enough water.\" Over time, those small wins add up and help you see your progress more clearly.\n\nRemember that consistency beats intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to burn yourself out trying to do everything perfectly.

        "llama_comment": "It's normal to feel like you're not making progress, especially when you're putting in a lot of effort. One thing that might help is to take a step back and re-evaluate how you're measuring success. Instead of focusing on the end goal, try breaking it down into smaller, achievable milestones. For example, with your workout routine, instead of getting discouraged by the lack of visible progress, focus on showing up consistently and completing your workouts - that in itself is a win. Additionally, consider seeking out accountability and support from friends, family, or a mentor who can offer guidance and encouragement. It's also important to remember that progress is rarely linear, and it's okay to make adjustments along the way. Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to change your approach - it doesn't mean you're failing, it just means you're learning and adapting. Keep moving forward, even if it feels like a small step at a time, and celebrate those small victories along the way.",

Sometimes progress is happening, but it's hard to see without data. Try logging your weights, reps, or even just how you feel during/after workouts. Also, consider if your routine needs a tweak. Maybe you've plateaued and need to change up the exercises or intensity.\n\nAs for relationships and goals, break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. Big goals can feel overwhelming, but small wins build momentum. And with relationships, are you communicating your needs and expectations clearly? Sometimes a little adjustment in communication can make a big difference.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to re-evaluate and adjust your approach.

Here are a few steps that might help you break this habit and build some confidence:\n\n1. **Awareness and Redirection**: Start by trying to catch yourself when you begin imagining these conversations. It might help to keep a small notebook or use a notes app on your phone to jot down when it happens. Once you notice it, try redirecting your thoughts to something else, like a hobby or a task you enjoy.\n\n2. **Mindfulness Practice**: Consider incorporating some mindfulness exercises into your routine. This can help you become more aware of your thoughts and give you more control over them. Apps like Headspace or Calm offer free resources to get started.\n\n3. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have these thoughts, but remind yourself that they don't define you. Try to replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations. It might feel awkward at first, but it can gradually improve your self-esteem.\n\n4. **Assertiveness Training**: Since you mentioned being a pushover, practicing assertiveness can be really beneficial. There are plenty of free resources online, including videos and articles, that can teach you how to express your needs and stand up for yourself in a healthy way.\n\n5. **Community Support**: Even if therapy isn't an option right now, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share experiences and get support from others who understand what you're going through.\n\nRemember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You're already taking a big step by seeking advice, and that's something to be proud of. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "This is actually a pretty common coping mechanism - your mind is trying to build confidence and process social anxiety through these imagined scenarios. While it provides temporary relief, you're right that it's not a healthy long-term solution.\n\nHere's what's worked for others in similar situations: When you catch yourself in these thought loops, try redirecting that mental energy into real-world confidence building. Start small - maybe practice making eye contact at the store, or giving a genuine compliment to someone. These tiny wins create actual positive memories to replace the imagined ones.\n\nFor the underlying confidence issues, consider joining a supportive group activity where social interaction isn't the main focus - maybe a running club, volunteer organization, or hobby group. This lets you build social skills gradually while having a shared activity as a buffer.\n\nYou can also work on physical confidence builders that don't require other people - regular exercise, learning a new skill, or completing small daily challenges you set for yourself. The goal is to create real achievements that prove to yourself that you're capable and worthy of respect.\n\nWhen you feel the urge to imagine these scenarios, try asking yourself \"What small thing can I do right now that would make me genuinely proud?\" Then do that instead. Over time, you'll build a foundation of real confidence that makes those imagined conversations less necessary.\n\nRemember that building genuine confidence is a gradual process. You don't need to transform overnight - just focus on making small improvements each day. Your awareness of the issue and desire to change it is already a huge first step.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like these imagined conversations are serving as a coping mechanism for you, providing a sense of confidence and control that's missing in your real-life interactions. To break this cycle, you might want to try addressing the underlying issues - your low self-esteem and fear of people - rather than just trying to stop the thoughts cold turkey. Since therapy isn't an option for you right now, you could look into online resources like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) workbooks or self-help books that focus on building confidence and assertiveness. \n\nAdditionally, you might find it helpful to practice small acts of assertiveness in low-stakes situations, like speaking up in a group setting or expressing your opinion to a friend. This can help you build confidence and develop a sense of self-efficacy that's not reliant on these imagined conversations. It's also worth exploring ways to challenge and reframe the negative self-talk that might be contributing to these thoughts - for example, by writing down positive affirmations or practicing mindfulness exercises. Remember that overcoming deep-seated habits and fears takes time and patience, so be gentle with yourself and try to focus on making progress rather than achieving perfection.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get where you're coming from. Those imagined conversations can be super addictive, especially when they're a way to feel in control. It's tough to just \"stop,\" so let's look at some alternatives.\n\nFirst, recognize the trigger. You mentioned you often don't realize you're doing it until you're already in the middle of it. Try to catch yourself earlier. Maybe keep a small notebook and jot down what you were doing or thinking right before you started imagining the conversation. Over time, you might see a pattern.\n\nSecond, replace the habit. Instead of just trying to stop, try redirecting that mental energy. When you catch yourself, consciously shift your thoughts to something else. It could be a simple math problem, a song lyric, or even just focusing on your breathing for a minute. The key is to have a go-to replacement ready.\n\nThird, work on building real-world confidence. Since the imagined conversations are filling a need for feeling assertive, try small steps in real life. Start with something super low-stakes, like asking a question in a store or politely disagreeing with a friend about something minor. The more you practice being assertive in small ways, the less you might need those imaginary scenarios.\n\nFinally, regarding your past trauma, while therapy is ideal, there are resources you can access in the meantime. Look into free online resources about assertiveness training and managing anxiety. Even just understanding the psychology behind your reactions can be empowering. There are also some great self-help books on these topics.\n\nIt's a process, and it's okay to slip up. Just keep practicing, and be kind to yourself. You've got this.\n"

It's possible that you're mourning the loss of your old self, or at least the freedom and spontaneity that came with it.\n\nRather than trying to suppress these feelings or beat yourself up over them, maybe try to explore what's really going on underneath. What are some things that you used to enjoy doing before you started making all these changes? Are there any hobbies or activities that you've had to put on the backburner that you could revisit? It might be helpful to find ways to incorporate some of that old carefree spirit into your new life, even if it's just in small ways.\n\nIt's also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings. They can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore your emotions and develop strategies for managing them. And hey, it's okay to not have all the answers right now - it's normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. Just taking the time to acknowledge and validate your feelings is a huge step forward.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you've made some incredible changes in your life, so first off, huge congrats on that! It's totally understandable to feel a bit lost even after achieving so much. Sometimes the \"after\" doesn't match the \"before\" picture we had in our heads.\n\nIt sounds like you might be experiencing a bit of an identity crisis. You've worked hard to become this new version of yourself, but maybe you haven't fully integrated it with who you were before. It's okay to miss parts of your old life, even the \"irresponsible\" bits. Maybe try to find healthy ways to incorporate some of that lightness back in. Could you schedule in some fun, low-pressure activities? Think about what you enjoyed before that wasn't destructive, and see if you can bring some of that back.\n\nAlso, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you have to be *perfect* at everything now. You're a beginner in your sport, relatively new to your job, and still figuring out the partner thing. Give yourself some grace! Focus on progress, not perfection. Maybe set smaller, more achievable goals in each area of your life.\n\nFinally, don't underestimate the power of talking to someone. A therapist could give you tools to navigate these feelings of dissatisfaction and help you integrate your past and present selves. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help. You've got this!\n"

So you're not really \"getting ready to work\" so you're more motivated. But you don't do it in the morning because now that blind motivation is actually coming to fruition and you're now unmotivated. It's akin to being really excited to go skydiving and then getting freaked out by jumping out of the plane. You knew what you needed to do prior, but when faced with the open door 5k ft in the air, all of a sudden you freeze.",
        "gpt_comment": "It's pretty common to feel more motivated at night because your mind is winding down from the day's activities, and you might feel a sense of urgency to get things done before the day ends. In the morning, though, your brain is still waking up, and it can be tough to get back into that motivated mindset. One thing that might help is creating a simple morning routine that includes something you enjoy or look forward to. This can help kickstart your day on a positive note. Also, try to set small, achievable goals for the morning to build momentum. Over time, this can help you carry some of that evening motivation into the next day. Remember, consistency is key, so keep experimenting with what works best for you!",
        "claude_comment": "This is a really common pattern - getting a burst of motivation at night but struggling to follow through in the morning. The key is understanding that motivation isn't reliable, but you can work with your natural energy patterns.\n\nTry this: When you feel that evening motivation, use it to set yourself up for success the next day. Write down 1-2 specific things you want to accomplish, prepare what you'll need, and make it as easy as possible for \"morning you\" to get started. The smaller and more concrete the task, the better.\n\nFor the morning itself, don't wait for motivation. Instead, focus on building a consistent wake-up routine that doesn't require much thinking. Start with something really simple like drinking a glass of water or making your bed. The goal is to get moving before your brain has time to talk you out of it.\n\nRemember that this isn't about forcing yourself to become a morning person. It's about creating systems that work whether you feel motivated or not. Start small, be consistent, and gradually your morning resistance will decrease.\n\nWhat specific task would you like to tackle first thing tomorrow? Sometimes just naming it can help make it feel more manageable.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a common phenomenon where your motivation and energy levels seem to peak in the evenings, only to crash in the mornings. One possible explanation is that your brain is more alert and focused at night due to the release of certain neurotransmitters, but then crashes after a poor night's sleep or lack of morning routine. To combat this, you might want to try establishing a consistent wake-up time and creating a morning routine that signals to your brain that it's time to be productive. This could be as simple as getting some natural light, exercising, or meditating for a few minutes each morning. Additionally, you could try breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling them in the evening when you feel most motivated, then reviewing and building on your progress in the morning. By doing so, you might find that your motivation becomes more consistent throughout the day.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get that feeling! It's super common. A couple of things might be happening. First, nighttime often feels less pressured – the day's over, so you feel free to dream and plan. Second, maybe you're not getting enough sleep, so your willpower is drained by morning.\n\nTry this: Before bed, write down *one* super small, achievable task you'll do first thing in the morning. Like, \"drink a glass of water\" or \"stretch for 5 minutes.\" The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Getting that first win can kickstart your motivation for the rest of the day. Also, experiment with your sleep schedule and see if getting more rest helps. Good luck!\n"

Understanding the context and experiences of others can help break down stereotypes.\n\n2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it's based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\n\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\n\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\n\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds. Listening to their stories and perspectives can be eye-opening and help you grow.\n\nRemember, change takes time and effort, but acknowledging the problem is a huge first step.

        "claude_comment": "Recognizing these thought patterns and wanting to change them is a great first step. Breaking free from prejudiced thinking takes conscious effort and practice, but it's absolutely achievable through discipline and intentional habit-building.\n\nStart by catching yourself in the moment when these thoughts arise. Instead of letting them flow automatically, pause and actively challenge them. Ask yourself: \"What evidence actually supports this view? Am I making unfair generalizations? What other factors might explain this situation?\"\n\nA practical approach is to deliberately expose yourself to perspectives and stories that humanize people from different backgrounds. Find documentaries, books, or podcasts created by people from the groups you have biases against. Learning about individual experiences and achievements helps break down stereotypes.\n\nAnother effective technique is to practice \"replacement thinking.\" When you notice a prejudiced thought, immediately replace it with a more rational, fact-based observation. For example, if you catch yourself thinking \"that's typical of [race],\" consciously shift to \"that's typical of individuals who make poor choices, regardless of background.\"\n\nRemember that changing thought patterns takes time. Be patient with yourself while remaining committed to improvement. Each time you successfully challenge and redirect a biased thought, you're building new neural pathways and better habits of thinking.\n\nConsider keeping a private journal to track your progress and reflect on what triggers these thoughts. This can help you identify patterns and measure your improvement over time.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change harmful thought patterns, so kudos to you for recognizing the issue and seeking help. Recognizing and challenging our own biases is a difficult but crucial step in personal growth. One strategy that might help is to practice critical thinking when consuming media - ask yourself if the narrative being presented is balanced, if it's perpetuating stereotypes, and what other factors might be at play. Additionally, try to seek out diverse perspectives and engage with content that challenges your existing views. When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and reflect on why you're thinking that way - is it based on personal experience, or is it a product of societal conditioning? By becoming more aware of your thoughts and actively working to reframe them, you can start to break down those biases. It's also important to remember that having racist thoughts doesn't define your worth as a person, but rather it's an opportunity to learn and grow. You might consider exploring resources on unconscious bias, privilege, and social justice to help broaden your understanding. Remember, changing thought patterns takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep working towards a more empathetic and inclusive mindset.",

That takes courage.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with ingrained biases, and breaking those down takes conscious effort and discipline. One thing that might help is actively seeking out positive stories and perspectives from the groups you're having these thoughts about. Make a conscious effort to diversify your social media feed and the news sources you consume. Expose yourself to different viewpoints and experiences.\n\nAnother thing you could try is challenging your own thoughts when they arise. When you catch yourself thinking something racist, ask yourself: \"Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? Is there another way to interpret this situation?\" It's like training a muscle – the more you challenge those thoughts, the weaker they become.\n\nIt's also worth considering *why* you might be having these thoughts. Are you feeling insecure or threatened in some way? Sometimes, biases are a way of trying to feel superior or protect ourselves. Understanding the root cause can help you address the issue more effectively.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. This isn't going to change overnight. It's a process of unlearning and relearning. Acknowledge your progress, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. Keep at it, and you'll gradually start to see a shift in your thinking. Good luck!\n"

Many people your age are in similar situations, even if social media makes it seem otherwise.\n\nLet's break this down into manageable steps. Start with your physical health since that affects everything else. You don't need motivation - you need routine. Pick one small thing to do daily, like a 10-minute walk. That's it. Don't worry about weight loss yet, just build that one habit.\n\nFor the career situation: Instead of viewing those qualification attempts as failures, see them as data points. They're telling you something important - maybe this isn't the right path, or maybe you need a different approach. Take a week to explore other career options. Look up \"day in the life\" videos for different professions. Sometimes seeing the actual work helps clarify what you might enjoy.\n\nRegarding social connections: Join local groups or clubs related to any interest you have, even if it seems minor. Check Meetup or Facebook events in your area. The goal isn't to make best friends immediately, but to have regular social interactions.\n\nMost importantly, stop comparing yourself to others. Everyone's timeline is different. Your friends' highlight reels on social media don't show their struggles and doubts.\n\nPick one small thing to start with today. Just one.

There are many things in my life that needs my attention. I want to tell my story which I hesitated many times to write.\n\nAs I said I'm a 40 years old man. I got married 7 years ago from the kindest and most beautiful woman I ever saw. I never had any relations before marriage. Just after marriage, I discovered that I have erectile dysfunction. No body knows why. I'm on the overweight side so Endocrinologists said that I need to loose weight to optimize my hormonal profile. My psychiatrists talked about watching porn and porn induced erectile dysfunction. Urologists don't have answers, for them I should proceed for implant surgery which other doctors are refusing since I'm not completely flaccid. Not before I solve my porn addiction and overweight problem.\n\nI tried hard loosing weight staying away from porn but everytime I fail, I get depressed and I become worse than before. I know some people my consider this nonesense but I always had problems with my self confidence and social anxiety. That was the final blow. Eventually my wife left me. that was 1 year ago. My depression starting reflecting on my behaviuor with her. I started treating her badly but i never hit her before you jump to conclusions. Although by the time she left me, I already had started seeing psychiatrists but she couldn't take it anymore. I love her so much. I want her back. She never did me any harm and I treated her badly. I want to fix myself but I don't know if I can do it or no.\n\nI need to become athletic to correct all my hormones which I never did in my life even as a kid I wasn't active. I was a bookworm then a geek but never an active person. I need to stop watching porn which is the only thing now that gives me any kind of joy. I want to loose weight which increased dramatically since she left me. I need to take my medications again.

No body of my colleagues understands what i'm going through. No body will even if I told them. Multiple nationalities working togehter so it's not the mosr friendly atmosphere.

The older I get, the harder it gets to achieve anything.My work routine isn't regular which is another problem. I wake up at 5:30 am everyday. sometimes I go home by 3:00 pm, sometimes 7:00 pm and sometimes I spend a full 24 hours working (really 24h). No rules.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking for. Am I searching for motivation? Or searching for someone to tell me that's impossible and stop trying. am i just venting, I don't know.

Not only does this disrespect her autonomy, but you may not deserve to have her forgiveness based on the way you’ve treated her. \n\nI would look at this as a journey to self actualization; and if there are good things that come of it then great. It took your wife leaving and you being SO unhappy that you have to make a change. Please don’t think that this level of motivation is going to exist forever.\n\nTo be quite frank I would be surprised if you were able to do this on your own.

First off, remember that change is a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Start by focusing on one or two areas that you feel you can tackle first. For instance, try setting a simple goal like going for a 10-minute walk each day. This can help with both weight loss and mental health. As for cooking, maybe start with easy, healthy recipes that don't require much time or effort. \n\nRegarding your porn addiction, consider seeking support from online communities or therapy groups that specialize in this area. It can be really helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through. \n\nAlso, don't be too hard on yourself about your work situation. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but try to find small moments of joy or relaxation in your day. And remember, it's okay to reach out to your friends. You might be surprised at how supportive they can be. \n\nLastly, keep in touch with your psychiatrist and follow their advice.

        "claude_comment": "First, know that you're not alone in dealing with multiple challenges at once. Many people have rebuilt their lives from similar situations - it's difficult but absolutely possible.\n\nLet's focus on small, manageable steps rather than trying to fix everything at once. Start with these three fundamental areas:\n\n1. Basic self-care: Set a simple morning routine. Shower daily, brush teeth, make your bed. These small wins build momentum and help combat depression. They're your foundation.\n\n2. Physical health: Start walking 15 minutes daily, no matter what. Just 15 minutes. When that becomes easy, gradually increase it. For nutrition, begin by preparing just one healthy meal per day. Master that before adding more.\n\n3. Porn addiction: Check out r/pornfree for specialized support. Install website blockers and find a replacement activity for when urges hit - even if it's just going for a walk or doing pushups.\n\nFor your irregular work schedule, create different versions of your daily routine - one for regular days, one for long shifts, etc. The key is having a plan for each scenario.\n\nDon't worry about becoming \"athletic\" right now. Focus on building basic healthy habits first. The rest will follow naturally.\n\nRegarding your career - your psychiatrist is right. Keep your job for now. It provides structure and stability while you work on yourself.\n\nRemember: progress isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, and that's normal. The key is to get back on track immediately after a slip-up, no matter how small.\n\nStart today. Right now. Take a shower, make your bed, go for a 15-minute walk. Then come back tomorrow and do it again. That's how rebuilding begins.",

It's clear that you're facing a complex set of challenges, but it's great that you're acknowledging them and seeking help. \n\nFirstly, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the big picture, focus on making progress one step at a time. For example, start with small changes to your daily routine, like cooking healthy meals or exercising for 10-15 minutes each day. As you achieve these small wins, you'll build momentum and confidence.\n\nIt's also essential to address your porn addiction and depression simultaneously. Consider seeking professional help from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide support as you work towards recovery.\n\nGiven your irregular work schedule, it might be helpful to create a flexible routine that adapts to your changing work hours. Use a planner or app to stay organized and prioritize your tasks, including time for self-care and relaxation.\n\nRemember that rebuilding your life takes time, effort, and patience. It's not impossible, but it will require dedication and perseverance. You've already taken the first step by sharing your story and seeking help. Now, focus on making progress, no matter how small, and celebrate your successes along the way.\n\nAs for your wife, it's understandable that you want her back, but it's crucial to focus on your personal growth and development first. Work on becoming a better version of yourself, and then you can reassess your relationship and consider reaching out to her in the future.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself, and try to reframe your mindset around your struggles. Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes, focus on what you can do differently moving forward. You've got this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't give up on yourself.",

It's definitely not impossible to turn things around, but you're right, it can feel overwhelming when you look at the whole picture.\n\nInstead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Pick *one* thing to focus on this week. Since your health is a big concern, maybe that's cooking one healthy meal a day, even if it's just a simple salad or grilled chicken. Or commit to a 15-minute walk each day. Small wins can build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nFor the porn addiction, try setting small goals there too. Maybe start by limiting your usage by 30 minutes each day. Find something else to fill that time, even if it's just reading a book or listening to music. There are also a lot of resources online and support groups that can help with addiction.\n\nAs for your job, maybe explore options for a less demanding role within the company or start looking for something different. It doesn't have to be a drastic change right away, but having a plan can ease some of the stress.\n\nDon't be afraid to lean on your psychiatrist and be honest about how you're feeling. They're there to help you navigate this. And maybe consider reaching out to those two friends, even if you're ashamed. True friends will understand and offer support, even if they're busy with their own lives.\n\nYou've got this. Just take it one step at a time, and be kind to yourself along the way.

Remember, everyone's path is different, and taking time to figure out what you want is actually a smart move. Here are a few things that might help:\n\n1. **Focus on Your Journey**: It's easy to compare yourself to others, but try to focus on your own progress. You're starting college with more life experience, which can be a huge advantage. \n\n2. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your college journey into smaller, manageable goals. This can help you stay motivated and give you a sense of accomplishment as you achieve each one.\n\n3. **Time Management**: Since you're considering extra credit hours, time management will be key. Use tools like planners or apps to keep track of assignments and deadlines. Prioritize tasks and set aside specific times for studying and working.\n\n4. **Forgive Yourself**: It's important to let go of the past. You made the best decision for yourself at the time, and now you're moving forward. Be kind to yourself and recognize that it's never too late to pursue your goals.\n\n5. **Connect with Others**: Try to build a support network with classmates or join study groups.

Good luck with your studies!",
        "claude_comment": "Taking time to figure yourself out was actually a mature and responsible choice. Many people rush into college right after high school because it's \"what you're supposed to do\" - then end up changing majors multiple times or dropping out entirely. You saved yourself both time and money by waiting until you felt ready.\n\nYour timeline is completely valid. Life isn't a race, and there's no universal schedule you need to follow. At 26, you'll have your degree AND four years of real-world experience that your peers won't have. That perspective and maturity will likely help you get more out of your education and make better career decisions.\n\nInstead of viewing the past as wasted time, try reframing it as preparation time. Focus on what you can control now: crushing your classes, building relationships with professors, and pursuing internships. Your age can actually be an advantage - professors and employers often appreciate older students who bring more focus and life experience to the table.\n\nRemember that success stories come in all shapes and sizes. Colonel Sanders started KFC at 65. Vera Wang began designing at 40. Your path is uniquely yours, and that's perfectly okay.

Now, you're starting college with a clearer sense of purpose, which can actually be a huge advantage. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own goals and progress. Set specific, achievable targets for yourself, like completing a certain number of credits per semester or landing a part-time job in your field. Celebrate your small wins along the way, and remind yourself that everyone's path is different. You might also find it helpful to talk to a counselor or academic advisor about your feelings - they can offer valuable guidance and support as you navigate this new chapter.

But seriously, 22 is still super young, and you made a conscious decision to take time off and figure things out.

Like, \"Attend all my Monday classes\" or \"Study for 2 hours on Tuesday evening.\" Small wins build momentum and confidence. Also, consider limiting your social media time if you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to others there.\n\nAs for managing extra credit hours while working, start slow. Don't overload yourself right away. See how you handle your initial course load and work schedule, then gradually add more if you feel you can handle it. Time management is key – try using a planner or app to schedule everything, including study time, work, and downtime.\n\nYou've got this!

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself—cleaning can be overwhelming, especially when you're juggling work, studies, and other activities. Here’s a simple approach that might help:\n\nStart small. Pick one area or room to focus on, like your bedroom or living room. Set a timer for 15-20 minutes and do what you can in that time. This makes it less daunting and helps build momentum. Once you see progress in one area, it can motivate you to tackle others.\n\nCreate a routine. Try to incorporate a few minutes of tidying up into your daily schedule. For example, spend 5 minutes each morning making your bed or clearing surfaces. Consistency is key, and over time, these small habits can make a big difference.\n\nConsider a decluttering session. Sometimes, having too much stuff can make cleaning feel impossible. Go through your things and decide what you really need or love. Donate or discard the rest. Less clutter means less to clean.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's a friend or a professional cleaner, sometimes a little assistance can make a huge difference and teach you new strategies.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - first off, you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Cleaning can feel really overwhelming when things have piled up, but it's absolutely something you can tackle with the right approach.\n\nStart by breaking it down into small, manageable chunks. Pick one area - like your coffee table or a single counter - and just focus on that. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see what you can get done in that time. When the timer goes off, you can stop if you want to. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue, but knowing you *can* stop makes it less daunting.\n\nFor maintaining cleanliness, the \"two-minute rule\" is super helpful: if something takes less than two minutes (putting clothes in the hamper, washing a dish right after using it), do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from building up into overwhelming piles.\n\nA simple daily routine can make a huge difference:\nMorning: Make your bed, put away dishes from the dish rack\nEvening: 15-minute cleanup, wipe kitchen counters, quick sweep\n\nDon't aim for perfection - aim for \"better than yesterday.\" Some days you might only manage one small task, and that's okay. It's still progress.\n\nConsider getting a few basic organizing tools like storage bins or a hamper for each room. Having designated spots for things makes it easier to maintain order.\n\nRemember: You're not \"lazy\" - you're learning a new skill set.

        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're acknowledging the issue and wanting to make a change - that's the first step to developing discipline in any area of your life, including cleaning. One strategy that might help is to break down the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire house, try focusing on one room or area at a time. Set a specific goal, like cleaning the kitchen counters or doing a load of laundry, and give yourself a deadline to complete it. This can help build momentum and make the task less daunting. Additionally, consider creating a routine or schedule for cleaning, so it becomes a regular habit rather than something you have to think about constantly. You might also find it helpful to identify the specific feelings or thoughts that hold you back from cleaning - is it the physical effort, the decision fatigue of figuring out where to start, or something else? Once you understand what's holding you back, you can start working on strategies to overcome those obstacles.

You might be surprised how much you can accomplish in those little bursts, and it doesn't feel so daunting.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to connect cleaning to something you already enjoy. Listen to a podcast or audiobook while you tidy up. Or, reward yourself with something you like after each short cleaning session.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask for help! Maybe a friend could come over and help you get started, or even just keep you company while you clean. Sometimes having someone else there can make a big difference. Good luck, you got this!\n"

      "title": "I'm so tired of procrastination and feeling like shit [Discussion] [Need Advice]",
      "body": "So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I will go into further details in this edit.\n\nSome comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.\n\nOther than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.\n\nI believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.\n\nBetween ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.\n\nI genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.\n\nI must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.\n\nUnlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.",

It’s something I will continue to work on and test. \n\nI break tasks into teeny tiny chunks (as small as you can go!) so you only commit to a little thing (much easier than a huge task!), get it done quickly and feel good about yourself and your achievements (which motivates you to do more)\nI also love lists.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Procrastination is a tough habit to break, but it's definitely possible with some small, consistent changes. \n\nFirst, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about an entire project, focus on just the first step. This can make starting feel less overwhelming. Also, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes to work on something. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, you'll find it easier to keep going.\n\nSince the internet is a big distraction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting sites during your study time. You can also try the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make study sessions feel less daunting.\n\nFor your home tasks, try to incorporate them into your daily routine. For example, do a quick 5-minute tidy-up every day instead of waiting for that rare burst of energy. \n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to struggle, and change takes time.

The good news is that you're aware of it and wanting to change at 18, which gives you plenty of time to develop better habits.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like the home environment hasn't been conducive to focused work, and you've gotten used to separating \"home time\" from \"work time.\" A practical solution would be to find a different physical space to do your work - like a library, study room, or quiet café. This creates a mental separation and can help break the association between home and procrastination.\n\nFor the immediate term with finals coming up, try the \"Pomodoro Technique\" - work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Start with just ONE 25-minute session. Don't think about the whole project, just commit to those 25 minutes. Most people find that getting started is the hardest part, but once you begin, it's easier to continue.\n\nFor the longer term, start building what I call \"small wins.\" Instead of trying to change everything at once, pick ONE small task - like doing laundry on a specific day of the week. Make it ridiculously easy to achieve. Once that becomes routine (which might take a few weeks), add another small habit.\n\nThe internet is clearly a major distraction for you. Try using website blockers during your study sessions. Forest is a good app that gamifies staying off your phone. You could also try the \"out of sight, out of mind\" approach - physically put your phone in another room while studying.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about being consistent. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with procrastination, and I appreciate your honesty. Given your history and the factors that contribute to your procrastination, it's clear that this is a deeply ingrained habit that will take time and effort to change. \n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you enjoy learning in classes but struggle with homework and research at home is a crucial insight. It might be helpful to explore ways to make your home study environment more conducive to productivity. This could be as simple as dedicating a specific area for studying, free from distractions like your bed or gaming console.\n\nSince you've mentioned that traditional methods like journaling or creating to-do lists haven't worked for you due to commitment issues, let's consider an alternative approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, start with small, manageable goals. For example, commit to working on a task for just 10-15 minutes without any distractions. After this short period, take a brief break before returning to the task. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help build momentum and make tasks less overwhelming.\n\nIt's also important to address your internet usage, as you've identified it as a significant contributor to your procrastination. Consider implementing website blockers or apps that help you stay focused on your tasks during certain periods of the day.\n\nGiven that finals are approaching, let's focus on creating a plan for the next week. Break down your study material into smaller chunks, and allocate specific times for reviewing each subject. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible, but don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – simply acknowledge the setback and get back on track.\n\nLastly, remember that developing discipline and overcoming procrastination is a journey. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. You've already taken a significant step by sharing your struggles and seeking help, so keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step each day.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Procrastination is a tough cycle to break, but it's definitely possible. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a long time, and you've got a good understanding of why it's happening.\n\nFirst off, don't beat yourself up too much. You're aware of the problem, and that's the first step. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can actually make procrastination worse.\n\nSince you mentioned internet distractions, maybe try some strategies to minimize those. Could you use website blockers or apps that limit your time on certain sites while you're trying to work? Even just putting your phone in another room can make a difference.\n\nYou also mentioned that you don't like doing extra work at home. Have you considered changing your environment? Maybe try working at a library, coffee shop, or even just a different room in your house. A change of scenery can sometimes help with focus.\n\nSince you have commitment issues with journaling and to-do lists, maybe try a different approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, start with one small, manageable task each day. Something like \"work on homework for 15 minutes\" or \"clean one small area of my room.\" The key is to make it so easy that you can't say no. Once you've built up some momentum, you can gradually increase the time or complexity of the tasks.\n\nAlso, remember to be kind to yourself. When you do procrastinate (and you will sometimes), don't use it as an excuse to give up entirely. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track as soon as you can. You've got this!\n"

I’ve been like this since I can remember, only difference now is I have tools to help vent the frustration instead of just blowing up at everyone. \n\nBut I also utilise this Frustration Time to my advantage — I open up my computer and set up my To Do word document, and get my phone out and set it up so I can type up things from the notes app straight into my computer. Then, when I’m pacing around hunting for something to do to calm me, everything is already set up to go on my desk. \n\nSo I make it as inviting as possible to just sit down and start typing up these notes of All The Things I wanted to do. \n\nAfter awhile of typing up, and seeing how many of the things I wrote in the notes while I was travelling *were already written down on my computer ages ago and forgotten about*, the problem solving gears start ticking in my brain, and I start looking for which of these To Dos I can cross off **today**. \nBefore long I’ve just spent several hours working on a To Do plan and my brain is in overdrive thinking about how it can achieve those things. Then it’s just a matter of actually getting up, and like with the computer and the notes - setting up a task so that everything is ready to just *go*. \nYou need to tidy that bookshelf? Pull everything off the bookshelf onto the floor. Organize the books from the decorations from the video games. Now you’re already halfway there and your brain is probably already getting excited thinking about how it can better arrange the bookcase. \n\n***\n\nIf you can’t get into that headspace at all when you get home, try wandering around your house doing random tiny jobs. Wipe that bench down, put that thing in the bin, put your dirty clothes from your travels into the wash. \nIf your brain is anything like mine, it’ll start seeing all these other things it could be doing, and it’ll direct itself to them once you start.",

And also get bored if I keep doing the same thing over and over. I thrive on novelty and in this case, I love the novelty of learning something new. \n\nThis is a typical cycle for me.

        "claude_comment": "Having multiple interests isn't inherently a problem - many successful people are polymaths. The key is learning to manage your attention strategically rather than trying to forcefully narrow yourself down to just one thing.\n\nConsider treating your interests like a portfolio rather than picking a single focus. You can have primary and secondary interests that get different amounts of your time and energy. This lets you maintain variety while still making meaningful progress.\n\nHere's what's worked for others in similar situations: Pick 2-3 interests to be your \"core\" focuses for the next 3-6 months. Give these the majority of your learning time. The others can be \"background\" interests you engage with more casually. After the time period, re-evaluate and adjust which interests are primary.\n\nFor example, you could focus primarily on data science and the health podcast for the next few months, while keeping cooking as a casual weekend activity. This creates structure while preserving the novelty you enjoy.\n\nTo maintain consistency, try:\n- Setting specific project milestones for your primary interests\n- Scheduling dedicated time blocks for focused work\n- Finding ways to combine interests (like using data science to analyze cooking trends)\n- Building accountability through sharing your progress\n- Celebrating small wins to maintain momentum\n\nRemember that careers rarely require purely singular focus. Many successful people combine multiple interests - like a data scientist who does science communication through podcasting. Your variety of interests could become your unique value proposition rather than a limitation.\n\nThe goal isn't to eliminate your natural curiosity, but to channel it productively.

One strategy that might help is to think about the common threads that run through your various interests. For example, you mentioned cooking, filmography, and creating online courses - could you combine these interests by creating a YouTube channel or podcast that focuses on food and health, and incorporates elements of storytelling and visual production? By finding ways to overlap your interests, you might be able to satisfy your desire for novelty while still making progress on a specific project. \n\nAnother approach could be to set a \"seasonal\" goal for yourself - commit to focusing on one interest for a set period of time (e.g. 3-6 months), and then switch to another one. This would allow you to make progress on multiple interests without feeling like you're neglecting the others. It's also worth considering the idea that you don't have to choose just one career or path - many people have successful careers that involve multiple pursuits, or they pivot between different fields over time.\n\nIn terms of staying consistent, it might be helpful to set aside dedicated time for each of your interests, even if it's just a small block of time each week. This could help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed. Finally, I'd encourage you to think about what you're hoping to achieve with each of your interests - is it creative expression, financial stability, personal fulfillment?

Think of it as seasons. You could dedicate, say, 3-6 months to really diving deep into one area.

Knowing you have dedicated time for them can ease the FOMO.\n\nAlso, consider how your interests might overlap. Could you use data science to analyze trends in film, or create a cooking show that incorporates evolutionary biology? Finding those connections can make your pursuits feel less scattered and more synergistic.\n\nFinally, remember that \"success\" doesn't always mean becoming a world-renowned expert.

That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am.

In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”\n\nLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/\n\nThere’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media.

Having a set time and place for studying can help train your brain to get into \"focus mode.\"\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those. This could mean studying in a quiet place, using apps to block distracting websites, or keeping your phone out of reach.\n\n4. **Use Your Short-Sightedness as a Tool**: Since you mentioned your vision, maybe use it to your advantage. Sit closer to the board or screen if possible, and use it as a reason to focus more intently on what's in front of you.\n\n5. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself a small reward after completing a study session. This could be a snack, a short walk, or a few minutes of a favorite activity.\n\nRemember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "It sounds like you already know what works for you - taking notes and researching what you don't understand. The challenge isn't finding the right strategy, it's getting yourself to actually do it consistently.\n\nStart small. Instead of trying to take perfect notes for every class, commit to just 10 minutes of focused note-taking per day. Set a timer on your phone if you need to. The key is making it so easy that you can't talk yourself out of it.\n\nFor the daydreaming, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique when you catch your mind wandering. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring your attention back to the present moment.\n\nYour short-sightedness is a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. Have you talked to your teachers about sitting closer to the front? Most are happy to accommodate this kind of request. You could also record lectures (with permission) to review later when you can see your screen clearly.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small improvements consistently. Pick one tiny change to implement this week. Once that becomes routine, add another. Over time, these small wins compound into major progress.",

One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle a huge study session, commit to focusing for just 10-15 minutes at a time, and then take a short break. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, try to identify what triggers your daydreaming - is it boredom, stress, or something else? Once you know what's causing it, you can develop strategies to address the root cause. It's also great that you've found ways to adapt to your short-sightedness in the past, so see if you can tap into that resourcefulness again to find ways to stay engaged and motivated.

Seriously, just that one small thing. Don't worry about being perfect, just focus on that one action.\n\nAlso, about the eyesight thing – could you get your glasses updated? Even a small improvement might remove that mental hurdle. If glasses aren't enough, maybe talk to your school's disability services; they might have resources to help you focus.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Everyone struggles with motivation.

Due to college being lenient on attendance, I didn't attend much lectures because of my social anxiety. I'm feeling all over the place right now.\n\nI tried to make a schedule multiple times and stick to it, but my attempts were unsuccessful due to procrastination as well as poor time management skills, I always end up feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBeing a dopamine addict doesn't help either.

I started when I was 26 and I am a very happy individual for the most part and learned how to be productive in my own way. If I started at 19 would be in an even better position than I am now. \n\nFirst thing though you can’t fucking HATE yourself over it, that doesn’t actually help. It’s super emotional and it doesn’t get you anywhere, it just makes you sad and emotional which triggers your brain to look for comfort, which in your case is just more procrastination. You want to be unemotional, scientific and make BABY STEPS. \n\nIf I was gonna give you any advice it’s don’t swing for the fucking fences, take baby steps, make small improvements every day they add up huge.\n\nDon’t study for 6 hours straight “tomorrow,” study for 5 minute right this second. If you have a fitness goal, don’t wait until tomorrow where you will eat perfectly clean and start the most beautiful diet. Eat a salad today, or just don’t drink one soda.\n\nGo very slow, progress takes time, stay calm you are going to have to make mistakes to learn, don’t get mad at yourself for mistakes. \n\nIf you have something that you need a professional for like adhd or depression, go make that appointment and make baby steps on that too",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there, first off, take a deep breath. It's great that you're reaching out for help, and it's a good first step. Here's a plan you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on small, manageable changes. For example, set a timer for 25 minutes and study during that time, then take a 5-minute break. This is known as the Pomodoro Technique and can help with focus and productivity.\n\n2. **Limit Screen Time**: Try using apps that block social media or limit your screen time. You can gradually reduce your usage by setting specific times when you allow yourself to check your phone.\n\n3. **Routine**: Establish a simple daily routine. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and include time for studying, meals, and relaxation. Consistency can help reduce anxiety and improve time management.\n\n4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's easy to fall into a cycle of self-criticism, but remember that everyone struggles with discipline at some point. Acknowledge your efforts and progress, no matter how small.\n\n5. **Therapy**: Keep up with therapy. It might take time to see improvements, but it's a valuable tool for managing anxiety and depression. Discuss your concerns with your therapist—they might adjust your approach or suggest new strategies.\n\n6. **Reach Out**: Consider joining a study group or finding a study buddy. This can provide accountability and make studying less isolating.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - stop beating yourself up. You're 19 and dealing with a lot: college transition, anxiety, and some tough habits. That's a real challenge, but it's also completely normal and fixable. Let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nStart with your most immediate concern - those October exams. For the next few weeks, forget about being perfectly disciplined or fixing everything at once. Your only mission is to pass those exams. \n\nHere's what you can do right now:\nGet a basic study outline going. What subjects do you need to cover? What's the minimum you need to learn to pass? Write this down.\n\nFor your phone addiction - install app blockers like Freedom or Forest. Don't try to quit cold turkey - instead, set specific times when you can use social media. Maybe 30 minutes in the morning and evening. The rest of the time, your phone goes in another room while you study.\n\nFor studying itself, use the Pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. No heroics needed - just sit down and do one session. Then another. The key is starting small and being consistent.\n\nAbout the anxiety and therapy - therapy takes time to work, and it's good you're sticking with it. Keep going. While you're working on that, try some basic anxiety management like deep breathing or going for a walk when things feel overwhelming.\n\nRemember: You don't need motivation to act. You just need to start, even if you don't feel like it. Take it one day at a time, one Pomodoro session at a time. Focus on small wins and build from there.\n\nCome back here and post your progress. This community's got your back.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and it's great that you've already taken the step of seeking therapy - that takes a lot of courage. One thing to consider is that developing discipline and overcoming addiction (whether it's to your smartphone or other behaviors) is a process that takes time, and it's not something you can change overnight. \n\nGiven your struggles with procrastination and time management, instead of trying to create a perfect schedule, try breaking down your study goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, commit to studying for just 25 minutes without any distractions, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help make studying feel less overwhelming.\n\nIt's also important to address your screen time and other addictive behaviors. You might consider implementing some website blockers or apps that track and limit your screen time, such as Freedom or SelfControl. Additionally, replacing some of your screen time with other activities, like going for a walk or reading a book, can help you feel more fulfilled and less reliant on instant gratification.\n\nRemember that it's okay to not feel motivated all the time, and it doesn't mean you're a failure. It might be helpful to explore with your therapist why you feel the need to prioritize instant gratification over your long-term goals, and work together to develop strategies to overcome this.\n\nLastly, try to practice some self-compassion. Beating yourself up over past mistakes or perceived shortcomings isn't going to help you move forward. Instead, focus on what you can control in the present moment, and take things one step at a time. You've got this, and it's okay to take it slow.",

Don't beat yourself up too much; a lot of people struggle with similar things, especially in college.\n\nFirst, with exams coming up so soon, let's focus on damage control. Forget about feeling like you need to master everything. Pick *one* subject, break it down into the smallest possible chunks, and commit to studying just one chunk for, say, 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break). Seriously, just 25 minutes. After that, take a real break. The goal isn't perfection, it's just getting *something* done.\n\nRegarding the phone addiction, try using app timers or website blockers. Even just putting your phone in another room while you study can make a difference. Baby steps. Maybe aim to reduce your screen time by 30 minutes each day.\n\nIt's great you're seeing a therapist, but progress isn't always linear. It takes time. Be open with them about feeling like you're not improving; they can adjust their approach.\n\nAs for the self-hate, try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what you *should* have done, focus on what you *can* do *right now*. Every small positive action is a win.\n\nYou're not a \"piece of shit.\" You're a 19-year-old dealing with a lot of pressure. Start small, be kind to yourself, and focus on making tiny improvements each day. You got this.\n"

Starting small and building on activities you actually like is the key to making habits stick.\n\nSince you mentioned being good at yoga before, why not start there? Even 5-10 minutes each morning of simple stretches can help build that exercise habit. You could combine this with a short skipping session - maybe just 1-2 minutes at first, then gradually increase as it gets easier.\n\nThe most important thing is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about doing intense workouts right away. A 10-minute daily routine you'll actually do is way better than an hour-long workout you'll skip. Try setting a specific time each day (like right after waking up or before dinner) and treat it as non-negotiable, just like brushing your teeth.\n\nKeep track of your exercise days in a simple way - maybe mark an X on a calendar or use a habit tracking app. Seeing those X's build up can be really motivating. And remember that if you miss a day, it's not the end of the world - just pick up again the next day.\n\nYou've already taken the hardest step by deciding to start.

Additionally, you could try to make your workout routine more enjoyable, whether that's finding a workout buddy, listening to music or podcasts, or trying out a new type of exercise. This might help shift your motivation and make it feel less like a chore. Lastly, consider starting small - instead of aiming for a full hour-long workout, start with 20-30 minutes and gradually increase the duration as the habit becomes more established. Good luck!",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, congrats on the flossing and cold showers, that's awesome! It sounds like you're already building good momentum.\n\nSince you're a morning person and the waking up isn't the issue, it seems like the pull of work is the biggest hurdle. Maybe try these:\n\n1. **Prep the night before:** Lay out your workout clothes, have your water bottle ready, and maybe even pre-select your workout. Reduce any friction that might make you choose work.\n\n2. **Start ridiculously small:** Don't aim for a full hour workout right away. Commit to just 15 minutes. Tell yourself you can stop after 15, but often you'll keep going. It's about building the habit, not crushing a workout every day.\n\n3. **Reward yourself (appropriately):** After your workout, have something you enjoy (that isn't work!). Maybe a specific coffee or a few minutes of reading. Positive reinforcement can work wonders.\n\n4. **Accountability:** Tell someone you're doing this, or find a workout buddy. Knowing someone else is expecting you can be a powerful motivator.\n\n5. **Reframe \"work\":** Is it possible you're using work as a form of avoidance? Maybe there's something about the workout you're not enjoying. Experiment with different types of exercise until you find something you genuinely like.\n\nGood luck, you got this!\n"

I even liked studying because I loved my field. \n\nI just can't seem to tolerate the actual process of sitting down and engaging in any of them anymore. I really want to but I can't stand it. I can't write anything, can't draw, can't study--can't stand doing anything persistantly for more than 10 to 15 minutes. I get stressed out and anxious pretty easily and quickly switch to something else to detach my mind. \n\n\nOn the rare occasions I sit down and really get sucked into something I *can* actually go for hours on end.

        "best_comment": "Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few strategies that might help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes to work on a task. The goal is to make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n2. **Routine and Environment**: Create a dedicated space and time for your activities. Even if it's just a corner of your room, having a consistent spot can help signal to your brain that it's time to focus.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Breaks**: Practice mindfulness techniques to help manage stress and anxiety. Also, schedule regular breaks to prevent burnout. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break) can be effective.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what typically distracts you and try to minimize these interruptions. This could mean turning off notifications or using apps that block distracting websites.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of each day, take a few minutes to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Adjust your approach as needed.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Your situation sounds really challenging, especially since it's a relatively recent change that's affecting multiple areas of your life. The good news is that you've already identified some key things: you know you're capable of deep focus (those rare occasions when you get absorbed for hours), and you have clear goals and plans. That's actually a strong foundation to build from.\n\nHere's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start treating focus like a muscle that needs gradual training. Instead of aiming for long study sessions right away, set a timer for just 5 minutes. That's less than your current threshold of 10-15 minutes, which makes it more manageable. The key is consistency over duration - do these 5-minute sessions multiple times a day.\n\nWhen you sit down for these sessions, keep your phone in another room and close all browser tabs except what you absolutely need. Create a clear physical and mental boundary between \"focus time\" and \"everything else.\"\n\nAfter a week of consistent 5-minute sessions, bump it up to 7 minutes. Then 10. Then 15. The gradual increase helps build tolerance without triggering the stress response you're experiencing. Think of it like building stamina - you wouldn't start training for a marathon by running 26 miles on day one.\n\nFor your academics specifically, try the \"just one problem\" approach. Instead of thinking about an entire study session, commit to solving just one problem or reading just one page. Often, starting is the hardest part, and this removes that mental barrier.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear. Some days you'll do better than others, and that's normal. The goal is to slowly rebuild your capacity for sustained attention through consistent, small steps rather than trying to force yourself back to where you were before 2020.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough situation, especially with your academics suffering. First, let's break down the fact that you can get engaged in activities for hours when you're fully into them - this suggests that the issue isn't necessarily with your ability to focus, but rather with initiating and maintaining that focus consistently. \n\nOne strategy you might find helpful is the \"2-minute rule\". When you're struggling to start a task, tell yourself you'll work on it for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you can continue beyond those initial 2 minutes. This can help build momentum.\n\nAnother approach could be to identify the specific points at which you feel your motivation or focus start to wane. Is it always after a certain amount of time? When you encounter a particular type of task or difficulty? Once you're more aware of these patterns, you can develop strategies to address them, such as taking short breaks before you reach that point of frustration, or breaking down larger tasks into smaller, less daunting ones.\n\nGiven your situation with limited access to therapists and the challenges in your environment, it might also be helpful to look into free online resources and communities focused on productivity, focus, and mental health. There are many blogs, podcasts, and forums where people share their experiences and tips for managing similar issues without professional help.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day or week, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they seem, as this can help build motivation over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I hear you. It sounds frustrating to have all these interests and the drive to do them, but then hitting a wall after only a few minutes. Since you mentioned it started fairly recently, maybe we can look at some strategies to break this down.\n\nFirst, try the Pomodoro Technique, but with *really* short bursts. Forget 25 minutes; aim for 5-minute work intervals with a 2-minute break. Seriously. Set a timer. The goal isn't to achieve a ton in those 5 minutes, but to prove to yourself you *can* sit down and focus, even for a tiny bit. Gradually increase the work intervals as you feel comfortable.\n\nSecond, think about \"habit stacking.\" Link something you *enjoy* doing with something you *need* to do. For example, \"After I play one song on guitar (enjoyable), I'll work on my book cover design for 10 minutes (task).\" The enjoyable activity acts as a reward and a trigger.\n\nThird, and this might sound counterintuitive, embrace the switching. Instead of fighting the urge to jump between tasks, schedule it. Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities. Knowing you *will* get to draw later might make it easier to focus on studying *now*. This can help you feel less trapped and more in control.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot, and it's okay to have off days. Don't beat yourself up if you can't focus. Just acknowledge it, and try again tomorrow. Small, consistent steps are key. Good luck, you got this!\n"

It's not about picking one thing forever, but about giving yourself the space to dive deeper into what truly resonates with you right now.

Having diverse interests makes you well-rounded and adaptable, which are huge assets both personally and professionally. \n\nThat said, your question about focusing makes sense given your limited time. Instead of completely dropping interests, consider cycling through them seasonally or quarterly. You could dedicate 3-4 months to really diving deep into one area while maintaining lighter involvement in others. This lets you progress meaningfully in each interest without totally abandoning the rest.\n\nFor example, you might focus on music for a quarter, then switch to fitness, then theater, etc. This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the depth of focused practice and the breadth of varied interests.\n\nThe book \"Range\" by David Epstein actually tackles this topic head-on. He makes a strong case for how generalists often thrive in our complex world. Another good read is \"Refuse to Choose\" by Barbara Sher, which specifically addresses managing multiple passions.\n\nRemember that your diverse background isn't a weakness - it's given you a unique perspective and skill set. The goal isn't to become narrowly specialized unless that truly calls to you. Instead, find a sustainable way to nurture your various interests while going deeper into each one at different times.\n\nYour approach to staying single while figuring things out is smart.

While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, it's common for people to narrow down their hobbies as they get older and their schedules become more demanding.

This could be your \"core\" hobby. Then, you can still make time for other interests, but in a more casual or occasional way - this would be your \"explore\" category. For example, if music is a big passion of yours, you could dedicate a few hours each week to playing an instrument or attending concerts, and then occasionally attend a football game or try out a new punk rock venue.\n\nIn terms of books, you might find \"Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less\" by Greg McKeown helpful. It's all about learning to prioritize what's truly important and eliminating non-essential activities.

If you don't, you can always put the time limit yourself and it will, at least, make you remember that this is not good for you and you'll probably move on to do something better.\n\nWhen you are in a low moment of your life and just don't feel like doing nothing, choose a comfort movie for you and watch it. It requires no effort and, in the end, you will be feeling slightly better, maybe better enough to do one small taks like taking the garbage out. And this can become a snowball effect if you are in the mood: \"I already done this, so I can do that other slightly bigger thing now\" and so on.\n\nIn therapy, idk about you, but I sometimes hid what I was ashamed of concerning my behaviour so my therapist thought I was getting better. DON'T BE LIKE ME! Tell all the worse and the best things to your therapist!!! Only then change can get to you faster. You need to tell everything.\n\nConcerning the binge-eating, idk who does the shopping at you home, but if it is you, build up the strenght to simply not buy what you binge-eat. You could also try to replace the foods with popcorn (with little butter and a pinch of salt), that is healthier, or buy more fruits and have them already saved on the fridge sliced, so that you can binge eat those. One fruit that helps me a lot (since sometimes I just don't have the energy to slice fruit up) is grapes. I love those green grapes that are \"seedless\" and they only require you wash them before you eat, so I always buy a great amount of them and when I feel the urge to eat something bc I'm anxious I go to the fridge, grab them and there you go, eating but not those muffins I used to eat before. Nuts in general are also a good option, the thing is to control yourself to eat one at a time and not put a handful in your mouth.\n\nAnd finally, I know how you feel about wanting to do everything all at once and then getting frustrated because you can't. Try this: for this month, I want to get back to reading, so every week from now on I will choose a short story to read. If I manage to do so, I will get a book to read, and I will finish it until the end of the year (remember, set major goals that are volatile and with a large expiration date, only the minor goals within the major ones should be with an expiration date closer to you). To do so, you can say \"I will try to read at least one page before going to bed/after waking up/during lunch\". And you can adapt this scheme to any other goals you might have. Just remember, it is little penguin steps at a time, because if you set a goal that is minor, it is easier to go beyond that and you will feel amazing bc you did more than you have set to do. This won't happen if you set a major goal that is difficult to achieve right away.\n\n(Oh, and one more thing, if you are the competitive type, you can make a competition with yourself, like \"I dare myself to cut this whole watermelon and put it in the fridge before this podcast episode ends\" and  if you don't make it, you at least already started doing it, so you can set another challenge \"I will do this before the sun sets\" or something else you feel appropriate to you)\n\nI hope this all helps :)",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're in therapy and seeking change—those are big steps. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but wanting to improve is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one habit to focus on first. Maybe it's reading a few pages a day or setting a specific time to shower. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Instead of vague goals like \"eat healthier,\" try something specific like \"eat one fruit a day.\" This makes it easier to track progress.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Consistency can help with discipline. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This might also help with your sleep issues.\n\n4. **Use Timers**: If you struggle to start tasks, set a timer for just 5-10 minutes. Often, starting is the hardest part, and once you begin, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for small achievements. It can be as simple as taking a moment to appreciate your effort.\n\n6. **Accountability**: Share your goals with someone you trust or join a community that can support you. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can be motivating.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for sharing your situation - it's actually pretty common for naturally gifted people to struggle with discipline since they haven't needed to develop those muscles before. The good news is that discipline is a skill that can be built, just like any other.\n\nStart really small. Like, microscopically small. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Maybe it's reading for 5 minutes before bed, or doing one push-up, or setting a consistent wake-up time. The key is making it so easy you can't say no.\n\nFor the procrastination, try the 2-minute rule: tell yourself you only have to work on something for 2 minutes. Usually once you start, you'll keep going. But if you stop after 2 minutes, that's fine too - you still succeeded at your goal.\n\nFor the sleep issues, start by setting a consistent wake-up time (even if you go to bed late). Your bedtime will naturally adjust over time. Getting your sleep schedule fixed will help with the exhaustion and make other changes easier.\n\nThe binge eating is worth addressing with your therapist specifically, as it often ties into deeper emotional patterns. In the meantime, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting - maybe start with eating one piece of fruit each day.\n\nRemember that failing attempts aren't failures - they're practice runs that teach you what doesn't work. Each time you try again, you're building that discipline muscle a tiny bit stronger. Progress isn't linear, but small consistent efforts compound over time.\n\nYou've already taken positive steps by going to therapy and reaching out for advice. Keep building on that momentum, one tiny habit at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're recognizing the patterns that have held you back in the past and wanting to make some significant changes, which is a huge step. Given your history of procrastination and lack of self-discipline, it might be helpful to start small and focus on building habits rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. For example, instead of trying to become a \"traditional student\" overnight, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes one or two productive tasks, like reading for 15 minutes or doing a quick workout. \n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your depression and anxiety are likely playing a role in your motivation and energy levels, so be sure to continue working with your therapist to develop strategies for managing those conditions. In terms of building motivation, you might find it helpful to identify the reasons why you want to make these changes - what is it about reading, editing videos, or eating healthier that's important to you? What benefits do you hope to get from developing these habits? Having a clear sense of purpose and meaning can help drive your motivation and make it easier to stick with your goals. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - building self-discipline and new habits takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing the need for change and seeking help, so try to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through this process.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you *want* to change is huge. That's the first step! It's also really common to struggle with discipline, especially when you've been able to coast by on natural talent.\n\nSince you're already in therapy, that's a great foundation. Maybe you could specifically discuss these procrastination and motivation issues with your therapist? They might have tailored strategies for you.\n\nIn the meantime, try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Want to read? Don't aim for a chapter, aim for *one page*. Want to edit videos? Open the software. Seriously, that's it. The momentum of just starting can often carry you further. This is especially helpful when you're feeling exhausted.\n\nFor the binge eating, maybe focus on *adding* healthy things instead of just restricting. Like, can you add one serving of veggies to each meal? Small wins build confidence.\n\nAnd for the sleep thing, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. It's brutal at first, but it can really regulate your energy levels.\n\nThe key is to be patient with yourself. You're not going to become a super-disciplined person overnight. Celebrate the small victories, and don't beat yourself up when you slip up. It's a process, not a race. Good luck, you got this!\n"

        "llama_comment": "It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to reach out to your supervisor after a month of radio silence. The first step is to acknowledge that it's okay to have struggled and that many people face similar blocks in their research.

You might say something like, \"Hi [Supervisor], I wanted to reach out and apologize for my lack of communication over the past month. Unfortunately, I've been struggling to make progress on my research and haven't been able to complete the tasks you assigned. I'm committed to getting back on track and would like to discuss a plan to move forward.\" This approach shows that you're taking ownership of your work and are willing to make things right.

Was the task too big? Were you unsure how to approach it? Did you lose interest? Understanding the reason will help you explain the situation to your supervisor and prevent it from happening again.\n\nIn the meeting, be prepared to suggest a revised plan. Break down the original task into smaller, more manageable steps. Set realistic deadlines for each step.

Since you mentioned studies, maybe start by setting a specific time each day dedicated to studying, even if it's just 30 minutes. Consistency is key, and once you get into the groove, you can gradually increase the time.\n\nFor the porn addiction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block adult content. It might also help to identify triggers and find alternative activities to distract yourself when the urge hits, like going for a walk or playing the piano.\n\nIncorporate fitness into your routine by starting with something simple, like a daily walk or a short workout video.

Pick ONE habit to focus on first. Given your goals, I'd suggest starting with a simple morning routine: wake up at the same time every day and immediately make your bed. This tiny win first thing creates momentum for the day.\n\nFor the porn addiction, install website blockers and keep your devices out of your bedroom. Replace that time with something else - maybe those piano lessons you mentioned. When urges hit, get up and move - do pushups, go for a walk, anything to break the pattern.\n\nFor studies, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day and build up. Sit in the front of your lectures - it makes it harder to skip or zone out.\n\nFor fitness, begin with a 15-minute walk each day. That's it. Once that becomes habit (usually takes about 2-3 weeks), add basic bodyweight exercises or extend the walking time.\n\nThe most important thing is consistency over intensity. Small steps done regularly will get you much further than trying to transform everything overnight.

Similarly, with fitness, begin with short 10-15 minute workouts or walks and gradually increase the duration and intensity. \n\nRegarding your porn addiction, it might be helpful to identify the triggers that lead you to watch porn and find alternative activities to replace it, such as reading or listening to music. You could also consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with personalized guidance and support.\n\nIt's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that setbacks will happen. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, but instead focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.

After my GCSE’s, it felt like my ability to stay motivated started declining. I’ve now graduated from university and it’s a struggle to do anything. \n\nAs for background info, I was prescribed antidepressants 4 years ago. Over that time, I’ve tried different types and doses. I think the most recent change was about 2 years ago. My depression has definitely contributed to times of feeling lethargic and demotivated, but lately it feels different.\n\nAfter graduating last July, I had a few months break before getting a retail job to earn some money. I left at the end of January this year to take the time to apply for a masters course. Any time I felt drained, I assumed it was from being at work a lot or recovering from my retail routine, however, it’s now been months and I’m still struggling. \n\nI have a lot of hobbies. I get interested in something for a while and then move onto something new. Some stick, a lot don’t. Now, I can’t seem to do any of them. I have dreams and goals, but anything more than getting out of bed feels too difficult. I have a very imaginative mind, but I no longer feel like I have the motivation to put it to use. Occasionally, I’ll have a day where I manage to clean my whole room or go for a run, but soon I go back to how I felt before. Even small attempts to break the cycle don’t seem to work for me. If they do, I eventually go back to struggling with things like putting a sock in a drawer. It makes me angry, frustrated and I feel worthless.\n\nOrdinarily, I find it hard to accept that sometimes my mental health prevents me from doing things. I automatically think I am making excuses and that I’m using my depression as one. I even feel like I’m making my depression up at times and convince myself I am attention seeking. Now, it’s even worse and I can’t stop worrying that I’m using depression as an excuse for plain laziness. I’ve wondered if something like ADHD or bi-polar is responsible, but again, I feel I am looking for a reason to explain ordinary laziness. \n\nI often see things like ‘don’t demand too much of yourself’ and ‘it’s ok if all you did today was survive’ or ‘you are allowed to take a break’, but I tell myself that these don’t apply to me. I shouldn’t go easy on myself because I have no reason to be like this. I am just lazy and useless and it is my own fault.\n\nI just want to go back to feeling motivated and being productive.

The \"gifted kid burnout\" is a very real phenomenon, and the transition after university can be particularly tough.\n\nFirst off, please know that seeking explanations for how you're feeling isn't making excuses - it's trying to understand yourself better so you can move forward. Whether it's depression, ADHD, or something else, these are real medical conditions that deserve proper attention. Consider talking to your doctor about how your current medication is working and potentially getting evaluated for ADHD, as many of your experiences align with its symptoms.\n\nNow, for some practical steps forward: Instead of trying to recapture your old spark all at once, start rebuilding it gradually. Pick one tiny habit - something ridiculously small like putting away one item before bed. The goal isn't to clean your whole room; it's to build trust with yourself that you can do something consistently.\n\nWhen you have those occasional productive days, rather than seeing the return to struggle as failure, try to identify what made those days different. Was it better sleep? More structure? Understanding these patterns can help you recreate more good days.\n\nAlso, those messages about being gentle with yourself? They absolutely apply to you. Think of it this way: if you were training for a marathon after being inactive, you wouldn't start by running 26 miles. You'd start with walking, then jogging, gradually building up your stamina. The same applies to mental and emotional energy.\n\nConsider setting up a very simple routine - even just 10 minutes of something you used to enjoy, without any pressure to be \"productive.\" The goal isn't to feel motivated (motivation follows action, not the other way around), but to simply show up and do the thing, however imperfectly.\n\nRemember: you're not lazy or worthless.

It's possible that your treatment plan could be adjusted or that there are other underlying factors at play, like ADHD or bipolar disorder, as you've mentioned. But even if that's not the case, talking through your feelings and experiences with a professional can provide valuable insights and strategies to cope.\n\nIn terms of building motivation and productivity, it might be helpful to start incredibly small. Instead of trying to tackle big projects or hobbies, begin with tiny, manageable tasks like making your bed or putting away one item. Celebrate each of these tiny wins, no matter how insignificant they seem. Sometimes, getting momentum going, even at a very slow pace, can help build confidence and motivation.\n\nIt's also important to challenge the narrative that you're lazy or useless. Those are harsh judgments that don't account for the complexities of mental health, personal growth, or the simple fact that everyone has ups and downs. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay, and that taking care of your mental health is not something to be ashamed of. \n\nLastly, consider keeping a journal or log of your days - not to track productivity, but to observe patterns, feelings, and small accomplishments. This can help you identify times when you feel more motivated or capable, and what might contribute to those feelings.\n\nRemember, rebuilding motivation and finding your spark again is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself.

It's great that you're reaching out.\n\nFirst off, cut yourself some slack. You've been through a lot – graduating, navigating antidepressants, and dealing with the post-retail slump. It's not laziness; it sounds more like burnout and potentially some lingering effects from the depression.\n\nInstead of trying to overhaul your entire life, maybe focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps. Like, instead of cleaning your whole room, could you just put one thing away? Or instead of a run, a 5-minute walk around the block? The idea is to make the barrier to entry so low that it's almost impossible to say no. Those small wins can build momentum.\n\nAlso, it might be worth revisiting your doctor about your medication. You mentioned it was changed two years ago, and sometimes things need tweaking. It's a process, and it's okay to ask for help with it.\n\nRegarding the hobbies, don't pressure yourself to stick with something if it's not bringing you joy. Maybe try revisiting an old hobby you used to love, or explore something completely new without any expectations. The point is to experiment and see what sparks your interest, even if it's just for a little while.\n\nFinally, challenge those negative thoughts. You're not lazy or useless. You're a person who's struggling, and that's okay. Try writing down those negative thoughts and then writing down a more realistic and compassionate response to each one. It sounds cheesy, but it can help reframe your thinking. You've got this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n"

        "best_comment": "It might be useful to understand how habits work.\n\nFor habits a few things that helped me were knowing:\n\n* They become automatic\n* They can be measured (using the Self Report Habit Index) and you should record them to help with adherence\n* They take longer than you think to establish (average: 66 days)\n* It's generally better to start one at a time (though there are exceptions)\n* They get harder before getting easy\n* Implementation Intention, forming a clear trigger, is really key\n* Mental Contrasting, planning for potential stumbling blocks is also a lab tested method of getting to a habit\n* Tiny Habits, starting ridiculously small UNTIL the habit forms up, THEN and only then expanding it, really helps avoid the tendency to quit after 2 or 3 weeks.\n* When forming they don't require a strict streak. So if you miss a day, remember that the habit is a deeper structure in the brain that is still forming. So be compassionate, pick it up tomorrow, and try not to make it a streak of missing the activity. Do not think you're starting from square one.\n\nSo right there you've got a good starting map. You might also think about how sleep works. Some things that helped me with my sleep issues were:\n\n* Figuring out the variables that had the most impact. For me that was light and caffeine.\n* Getting more light - especially 30 min as soon as I got up - significantly improved my sleep onset latency\n* Programming my phone helped as well. Blue light filters automatically go on, and I\"m seriously considering using the Bixby Samsung Routines app to just block all distracting apps at bed time.\n* Nighttime routines are great, but most people will formalize them by saying \"I'll do X BEFORE I go to bed\". That's not how habits work. You need a trigger first - so set one if you're going to make a nighttime habit.\n* Some great nighttime habits are alternative bridging activities that get you ready for bed. Journaling, stretching, light meditation, pranayama, creativity and art (non perfectionist, low stakes) works great for me.\n* I found that my natural wakeup time has more to do with what I did the day before. Focusing on getting that morning light and getting to bed on time helped make waking up early *solidly* solved, and not a matter of setting a bunch of stressful alarms, which is a topical solution.\n\nProductivity at work:\n\n* There's a lot here, but one thing that really helped me was understanding optimal work times. I highly recommend Cal Newport's book Deep Work.\n* He advocates really being strict by building up. Most people can't just jump into even a bit of deep work without strain.\n* Managing productivity is a whole thing unto itself. It's navigating the post lunch slump, knowing how, when, and what breaks to take. And it's knowing how to assign what KIND of task when - if you're tired, you probably don't want to be editing anything.\n* One of the best things that helped me was interspersing workouts with work. The optimal work:rest ratio is 52:17, which gives me enough time to do some micro workouts. Not only can you get a full workout in (and there are people talking about this is you look it up), but you energize yourself without tiring yourself out with a full separate workout habit. Behaviorally it also seems to lodge the workout habit (very quickly) in better because it's sandwiched between another structure of work. Obv, this depends on your work, but it's something to think about.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's great that you're reaching out for help. Building a routine can be challenging, especially when life throws curveballs. Here’s a simple approach that might help:\n\nStart small and focus on one habit at a time. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine, pick one thing to work on, like waking up at 6:30 am. Once that becomes a habit, add the next thing, like a short morning workout. \n\nFor your phone scrolling, try placing your phone out of reach when you go to bed. This way, when you wake up, you’re less tempted to grab it first thing. You could also try setting a specific time to start your laptop, like 8:30 am, to give yourself a buffer for a morning routine.\n\nWhen it comes to chores, try the \"two-minute rule.\" If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This can help prevent things from piling up.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. Progress isn’t about being perfect; it’s about being consistent over time. Celebrate small wins and be kind to yourself. You’ve got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I totally get the struggle with routines, especially after dealing with depressive episodes. The key is to start much smaller than you might think and build up gradually.\n\nInstead of trying to implement that full routine at once, pick just ONE small thing to focus on for the next week. Since you mentioned wanting that morning mental space, let's start there. When you wake up at 6:30, immediately put your phone in another room and sit somewhere comfortable for just 5 minutes. That's it. Don't worry about meditation or journaling yet - just sit quietly for 5 minutes.\n\nOnce that becomes easier (maybe after a week or two), add one more small thing. Maybe it's doing a 5-minute stretch routine right after your quiet time. Then maybe a week later, add making your bed. \n\nThe reason your previous routines didn't stick is likely because you were trying to change too much at once. Our brains resist big changes, but can handle tiny ones. Think of it like building a house - you need a solid foundation before adding walls and a roof.\n\nFor the phone scrolling issue - try putting your phone across the room before bed so you physically have to get up to turn off the alarm. Once you're up, don't grab the phone - just head to your quiet spot for those 5 minutes.\n\nRemember that consistency matters more than perfection. If you miss a day, just pick back up the next morning. No need to beat yourself up or start over. You're not a shit person - you're someone who's actively working on self-improvement, and that alone is worth being proud of.\n\nStart small, be patient with yourself, and build up slowly. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling to get back into a routine after some setbacks, and that's totally understandable. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing your tendency to be unrealistic with planning - that's a huge step. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on building habits one at a time, rather than trying to overhaul your entire schedule at once. For example, you could start by committing to waking up at 6:30 am and doing just one thing, like journaling or meditating, before getting ready for work. \n\nAs for your timetable, instead of creating a rigid schedule, you might try blocking out larger chunks of time for different activities, like \"work\" or \"self-care,\" and then be more flexible within those blocks. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by trying to stick to a super detailed plan. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be perfect - if you miss a day or two, don't give up. Just get back on track as soon as you can.\n\nIn terms of procrastination, you might try breaking down your work tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then focus on making progress on one task at a time. And hey, it's great that you're aware of your tendency to scroll through your phone in the morning - maybe try replacing that with something else, like reading or listening to music, to help you ease into your day.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself, okay? It's clear you're really struggling, but you're also taking steps to address it, and that takes a lot of courage. Keep in mind that building discipline and habits is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out and aware of the issues is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much about past routines failing; depressive episodes can really throw a wrench in things.\n\nInstead of aiming for a rigid timetable right away, maybe try focusing on one or two key habits to start. Since you mentioned the morning phone scrolling, how about this: aim to get out of bed within 15 minutes of waking up for a week. No pressure to work out or meditate, just get your feet on the floor. Baby steps are key.\n\nFor the unrealistic planning, try \"chunking\" your goals. Instead of planning a full HIIT workout, tell yourself you'll do 5 minutes of jumping jacks. Often, starting is the hardest part, and you might find yourself doing more. If not, 5 minutes is still a win!\n\nRegarding chores, maybe pick one small task per day. Load the dishwasher, wipe down the counter, etc. It's less overwhelming than a weekend marathon.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not a \"shit person\" for struggling. Building habits takes time and consistency, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate the small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Good luck, you got this!\n"

        "claude_comment": "This post-lunch sleepiness is actually really common - it's often called the \"post-lunch dip\" and happens due to a natural drop in your body's circadian rhythm combined with digestion taking up energy. The good news is there are several ways to manage this:\n\nFirst, try adjusting what you eat for lunch. Large, carb-heavy meals tend to make this worse. Instead, opt for a balanced lunch with lean protein, vegetables, and complex carbs. Also, watch your portion size - overeating definitely increases that sleepy feeling.\n\nGetting some movement right after lunch can make a huge difference. Even a 10-minute walk outside can help wake you up and boost your energy levels. The natural light exposure helps regulate your circadian rhythm too.\n\nStay hydrated throughout the day, especially around lunchtime. Sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration. Keep a water bottle at your desk and sip regularly.\n\nIf you still feel the need to rest, consider a proper power nap (15-20 minutes max) instead of lying in bed for an hour. Set an alarm and get up when it goes off. This can actually boost your afternoon productivity instead of derailing it.\n\nThe key is breaking the habit of going to your bed. Maybe rearrange your space so you're not working near your bed, or create a designated break area that's not your bedroom. Sometimes just changing your environment can help create new patterns.",

Instead of \"study for 3 hours\", try \"read one page\" or \"write one paragraph.\" The momentum often carries you further, but the small initial commitment makes it less overwhelming.\n\nExternal accountability helps a lot - study groups, gym buddies, regular check-ins with friends. When motivation is variable (thanks ADHD!), having others expecting you helps bridge those gaps.\n\nMost importantly - be patient with yourself as you figure out what works for YOUR brain. Some traditional productivity advice won't fit, and that's okay.

The specific habit matters less than proving to yourself you can stick to something manageable.\n\nFor the career piece, consider exploring adjacent fields where your existing skills would transfer well. You don't have to jump right back into the exact same role. What aspects of your previous work did you genuinely enjoy before burnout set in? Those elements could point toward alternative paths that feel less threatening.\n\nIn the meantime, work on building a sustainable daily routine. Add structure back into your days bit by bit. Once you have some basic habits locked in, you'll likely feel more equipped to tackle bigger challenges like the job search.\n\nDon't hesitate to talk to a career counselor or therapist if you can access one. They can help you process what happened and develop strategies for moving forward. Burnout recovery takes time, but you've already taken the crucial first step of recognizing you want things to change.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've been through a really tough time and are still feeling the effects of burnout, even years after leaving your job. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the need for change and are willing to work on rebuilding your self-discipline. That in itself is a huge step forward. \n\nGiven your situation, it might be helpful to start small and focus on building habits outside of your career. Try to identify one or two areas where you'd like to see improvement, such as exercise, reading, or cooking, and set super achievable goals for yourself. This could be as simple as taking a 10-minute walk each day or dedicating 30 minutes to a hobby. As you start to build momentum in these areas, you can begin to translate that discipline into other parts of your life, like job searching or exploring new career paths.\n\nIt's also important to consider seeking out resources that can help you navigate this transition. Have you thought about reaching out to a career counselor or a therapist who can help you work through your fears and anxieties about returning to your old field or exploring new ones? They may be able to offer valuable guidance and support as you work to get back on your feet.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the value of taking care of yourself during this time. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Remember that rebuilding your life and your sense of discipline takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's totally understandable that your discipline took a hit. Three years is a long time to feel stuck, but it's definitely not too late to start rebuilding.\n\nFirst, be kind to yourself. You went through a high-stress situation for a long time. It's okay that you're not back to \"normal\" yet.\n\nRegarding discipline, start small. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once. Pick *one* tiny habit you want to build. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, going for a 15-minute walk, or spending 30 minutes job searching. The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Consistency is way more important than intensity at this stage.\n\nSince the thought of your old field scares you, maybe explore adjacent skills or roles. Could you leverage your existing knowledge in a less stressful environment, or in a slightly different capacity? Even informational interviews with people in related fields could give you some ideas and help you feel less intimidated.\n\nFinally, you mentioned this might be more than just a discipline issue, and you're probably right. If possible, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process the burnout and develop coping mechanisms for the anxiety you're feeling about returning to work. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. Good luck, you got this!\n"

I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. \n\nMy mom doesn’t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it’s been many many years (10+).\n\nI also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out. I also paid my tuition for one class at a local college. she still pays for my groceries and phone.

Just keep doing your best at whatever you set your mind to and maintain a growth mindset. You are already enough. Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma. Keep displaying the courage it takes to be vulnerable, like you did by sharing your story, and it will inspire those around you to do the same. Remember, you don’t need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm!",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I would get a job in construction. It's full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.\n\nYou can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.\n\nShe sounds toxic by telling you that you can't function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\n\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone's journey is different, and it's great that you're actively seeking ways to improve your situation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. **Job Situation**: Since your hours were reduced, it's smart that you're looking for additional part-time work. Keep applying and consider jobs that might offer more hours or better pay. Even if they're not in your ideal field, they can help you save up and gain more independence.\n\n2. **Education**: If you can manage it financially and time-wise, continuing with your class is a good idea. Education can open doors, but it doesn't have to be a full-time commitment right now. Maybe look into online courses or certifications that are affordable and can boost your skills.\n\n3. **Budgeting**: Try to track your expenses and see if there are areas where you can save more. Every little bit helps when you're working towards moving out.\n\n4. **Communication with Your Mom**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your mom about your goals and how she can support you in becoming more independent. Maybe there's a way to gradually take on more responsibilities that can help prove your capability.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be where you are. Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and celebrate the progress you make along the way.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not \"behind in life.\" There's no universal timeline, especially given how expensive housing has become. Many people in their 20s live with family while building towards independence.\n\nThat said, it sounds like your current situation isn't healthy. Your mom telling you you're \"incapable of functioning\" is concerning and likely affecting your confidence. The fact that you're working, studying, doing housework, and actively trying to improve shows you ARE capable.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\nMake a clear financial plan. Track every dollar you spend and earn. The $500 you're paying for storage could be going towards your own place or more classes. Talk to your mom about selling that stuff or finding a cheaper storage solution.\n\nDon't quit school, but do look for full-time work. Many companies offer tuition assistance - this could help you take more classes. A degree generally leads to better opportunities, but you can work on both simultaneously.\n\nStart building your independence in steps. Open your own phone plan. Take over your grocery expenses. Each small step builds confidence and practical skills. Look for roommate situations - this can make rent much more manageable while you're getting established.\n\nMost importantly, recognize that you're already taking positive steps. Working part-time, studying, and actively seeking solutions are all signs of someone who's capable and motivated. Keep building on that momentum, but be strategic about where you put your energy and resources.\n\nFocus on what you can control and change today, rather than feeling ashamed about the past. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, but the fact that you're recognizing your situation and wanting to make changes is a huge step. First, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to live with their parents into their 20s or even 30s, especially with the rising costs of living. \n\nIt seems like you have a few different goals competing for priority - becoming independent, finishing your education, and finding better work. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe focus on making progress in one area at a time. For example, you could try to increase your income by taking on more hours or finding a better-paying job, which would give you more financial stability and autonomy. \n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your goals and aspirations. It's possible that she's not aware of how her comments are affecting you, and talking it through could help clear the air and give you a better understanding of each other's perspectives.\n\nAs for whether to prioritize independence or education, it's not necessarily an either-or situation. You could try to find ways to balance both, like taking online classes or finding a job that offers tuition reimbursement. And it's definitely not stupid to work \"shitty jobs\" without a degree - many people have to start at the bottom and work their way up, and having some kind of income can give you the freedom to pursue other opportunities.\n\nRemember that becoming independent is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're already taking classes and paying your mom rent, which shows that you're capable of taking care of yourself to some extent. Try to focus on making progress rather than beating yourself up over what you perceive as shortcomings. You got this, and it's never too late to make changes and start moving in a direction that feels more fulfilling to you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're actively trying to change things is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much; everyone's journey is different.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the immediate issue: independence. It seems like you're stuck in a cycle where your mom's expectations are holding you back. You need a clear, actionable plan to break free.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily quit school *entirely*, but maybe scale back to focus on work for a bit. One class is manageable, but if it's a huge stressor, consider pausing. The goal is to get some financial breathing room.\n\nPrioritize finding better/more work. \"Shitty\" jobs aren't stupid if they're a stepping stone. Look for opportunities with potential for growth or skills development, even if they're not glamorous. Think about what skills you have or can easily learn (customer service, data entry, etc.) and target those areas. Temp agencies can be a good way to get your foot in the door.\n\nCreate a detailed budget. Track every penny coming in and going out. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and where you can cut back. It will also help you set realistic savings goals.\n\nStart small with savings. Even $25 a week adds up. The key is consistency. Automate it if you can, so it happens without you having to think about it.\n\nTalk to your mom. Have an honest conversation about your goals and your need for independence. Set clear boundaries and expectations. This might be difficult, but it's crucial. Explain that you appreciate her help, but you need to learn to stand on your own two feet. Maybe even propose a timeline for moving out, even if it's a year or two down the road.\n\nAs for the storage unit situation, that's a tricky one. Maybe suggest helping her list some of the items online to generate some extra income. It could be a win-win.\n\nUltimately, it's about taking small, consistent steps towards your goals. Focus on building your financial stability first, then revisit the degree question later. You've got this!\n"

Starting a business or YouTube channel could work, but they typically take longer to generate income than finding a job. Here's what I'd suggest:\n\nDon't completely abandon the job search - instead, treat it like a part-time commitment while you explore these other options. Set aside maybe 1-2 hours each day for applications and use the rest of your time to develop your business/content ideas.\n\nFor the business route: Start by researching your market and creating a solid plan. What specific problem will you solve? Who are your customers? What's your competitive advantage? Even with minimal capital, you need a clear strategy.\n\nFor YouTube: Pick a specific niche you're knowledgeable about and passionate for. The platform is saturated, but there's always room for quality content. Start creating videos while you still have time - this way you'll build skills and possibly an audience before fully committing.\n\nThe key is to maintain structure. Set specific daily goals for both your job search and side project development. Maybe \"2 job applications + 1 hour of business planning\" or \"3 applications + 2 hours of video content creation.\" This keeps you moving forward on multiple fronts without getting overwhelmed.\n\nRemember: successful businesses and YouTube channels rarely provide immediate income.

You've already shown you can be disciplined at work - now it's just about redirecting some of that energy homeward in small, manageable chunks.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a disconnect between your work life and personal life, where the discipline and motivation you have at work isn't translating to your home life. Given your history with Persistent Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorders, it's not surprising that traditional advice hasn't been sticking. \n\nOne thing you might consider is starting small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one tiny habit you'd like to build, like making your bed as soon as you get up or washing one dish after each meal. These tiny wins can add up over time and help build momentum. It's also worth exploring ways to make cleaning and organization more manageable, like breaking tasks into smaller chunks or finding a cleaning routine that works for you.\n\nIt's great that you've been open to trying new things, even if they haven't worked out - the hike, the PS5, etc. Sometimes it takes a bit of experimentation to find what actually resonates with us. Have you considered exploring other hobbies or activities that might bring you joy and help you feel more engaged at home? Maybe there's something creative, like drawing or writing, or something practical, like cooking or gardening, that could help you find some purpose and motivation.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to deal with medication and therapy not seeming to work, especially when it feels like you've tried everything. If you feel comfortable, it might be worth talking to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan or exploring other options - sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right combination of things that work for us. Keep in mind that building discipline and habits is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",

It's really common to feel drained after work, especially when you're giving it your all. Don't beat yourself up too much about the apartment situation – it happens.\n\nSince you've tried some bigger changes like the hike and they didn't stick, maybe try breaking things down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of aiming for a spotless apartment, could you commit to just washing one dish after each meal? Or making your bed every other day? The goal is to build momentum, not perfection.\n\nAlso, it might be worth revisiting your doctor or psychiatrist about your medication. Since you've been on so many different ones without much success, there might be other options or approaches to explore. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right fit.\n\nAs for the free time, instead of trying to force yourself into hobbies, maybe just experiment with different things for 15-20 minutes each day. See if anything sparks your interest, even if it's just a little bit. It could be anything from drawing to learning a new language to trying a new recipe. The key is to keep it low-pressure and fun. Good luck, you got this!\n"

If there's a guidance counselor equivalent, I would start with them.  If you have some inkling of different directions you'd potentially like to explore, I would bring these up as well as your concerns.  They may not have answers, but they potentially can point you in the direction of people who may be able to help you.  Another avenue that you might want to consider is the mental health counselors.  Most of the time they are free, and they can also assist you determine what goals are important to you and how you can go about achieving those goals while filtering out the stuff that isn't helping.  Another route that you could check out would be a mentor.  Some colleges have alumni in all walks of life who volunteer their time to help mentor current students.  They can give insight based on their experiences and help you to build out your network.  Your school may also have vocational tests available that you can take that might bring something to light that you hadn't considered in the past, and give you an opportunity to explore, also using the resources available at the school.\n\nAs for the RT program specifically, see if you can shadow at a local hospital in the various areas that your degree will apply to.  Being a radiology tech gives you a potential career path in a number of areas of the hospital that you may find interesting.  Some of the procedure areas, like Cath Lab, Interventional Radiology, Electrophysiology, Interventional Neurology, and Structural Heart (to name a few) employ RTs to assist the physician during the procedures.  Spending two or three hours shadowing and observing may give you a new perspective on your degree and help you find a more focused path to follow.  Or, it could end up definitively showing you that it's not the direction you want to go, which is also a good thing to find out.\n\nGood luck!",

It sounds like you're feeling pressured to follow a trend, but remember, your career should align with your interests and strengths. If radiology tech isn't clicking for you, it might be worth exploring other fields that excite you. \n\nStart by identifying what you enjoy or are curious about. It doesn't have to be tech if that's not your thing. Once you have a few ideas, try to learn more about them through online courses, workshops, or even volunteering. This can help you make a more informed decision about your major.\n\nNetworking can feel daunting, but it doesn't have to be.

        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not a failure at 26. Many people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and feeling uncertain about your path is completely normal.\n\nRegarding radiology tech vs. tech careers - remember that \"tech\" is an incredibly broad field. Not everyone in tech started by taking apart computers as a kid. Many successful people in tech discovered their interest later in life.\n\nThat said, don't feel pressured to switch to tech just because others are doing it or because of the salary potential. Radiology tech is also a solid career with good prospects. The healthcare field isn't going anywhere, and imaging technology keeps advancing.\n\nIf you want to explore tech, start small. Take a free online course in programming basics through Coursera or freeCodeCamp. Join local tech meetups - they're usually welcoming to beginners and great for networking. LinkedIn can also help you connect with people in tech fields.\n\nThe key is to take action while maintaining your current studies. Set aside 1-2 hours a few times a week to explore tech. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether to switch fields, rather than making a rushed choice based on FOMO.\n\nRemember: success isn't about racing others to a finish line. It's about finding work that aligns with your interests and abilities. Take it one step at a time, and focus on learning rather than comparing yourself to others.",

First, let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to not have it all figured out right now. You're 26, and many people change careers or majors multiple times throughout their lives.\n\nRather than trying to follow the crowd into STEM fields just because they're in demand, why not try to explore what actually interests you? What are your hobbies or passions outside of school? Are there any subjects that you've enjoyed learning about in the past, even if they're not necessarily \"practical\"?\n\nIt might also be helpful to talk to a career counselor or academic advisor who can help you explore different options and find a major that aligns with your strengths and interests. And don't worry too much about \"wasting time\" - taking a little extra time to figure out what you want to do can actually save you time and energy in the long run.\n\nAs for networking, you don't necessarily need to know people in the tech field to get started. You could try attending career fairs or industry events, joining online communities or forums related to your interests, or even just reaching out to people on LinkedIn who work in fields that you're curious about.

It's okay to re-evaluate your path. Radiology tech is a valuable field, but if it's not clicking, it's worth exploring other options.\n\nInstead of focusing on what *everyone else* is doing, try to pinpoint what *you* enjoy and what you're good at. What subjects did you like in high school? What activities make you lose track of time? Think about the problems you like solving. This can give you clues about potential career paths.\n\nAs for networking in tech, start small. Look for online communities related to specific areas of tech that interest you (even if it's just a little bit). Subreddits, Discord servers, online forums – these are great places to lurk, learn, and eventually ask questions. You don't need to be a coding whiz to participate. Just show genuine curiosity.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to reach out to people on LinkedIn. Find people in tech roles that sound interesting and send them a polite message asking for an informational interview. Most people are happy to share their experiences.\n\nFinally, remember that discipline isn't about forcing yourself to do something you hate. It's about building habits that support your goals. Start with small, manageable steps. Maybe it's spending 30 minutes a day exploring different career options or joining one online tech community. The key is consistency. You got this!\n"

This will help regulate your daily rhythm and make other habits easier to build. Set an alarm and put it across the room so you have to get up.\n\nCreate a basic daily schedule that includes dedicated study blocks. Start with just 2-3 hours total, broken into 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks. As this becomes routine, gradually increase the time.

      "body": "Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like \"I didn't have much more to say\" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\n\n**Two minors issues**\n\n* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \n \n\n**My two biggest issues**\n\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\" and the thought really really scares me.  \n \n* **Dating** \\--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \n \n\n**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",

Let's break this down a bit.\n\nFor your body image and gym routine, it's great that you're already making strides. The key to maintaining it is to find a routine that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing long-term. Maybe mix it up with activities you like, whether it's a sport, hiking, or even dancing. Consistency is more sustainable when it's fun.\n\nCutting down on alcohol is a solid move, especially since you've noticed it affects your decisions. Try setting clear boundaries for yourself, like limiting drinks to certain occasions or opting for non-alcoholic alternatives when socializing. It’s all about finding a balance that works for you.\n\nRegarding NoFap, remember that it's okay to take small steps. Instead of thinking about never doing it again, focus on reducing the frequency gradually. Celebrate small victories, like going a few days without it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. It's a journey, not a sprint.\n\nAs for dating, it's perfectly okay to take a break and focus on yourself, especially with all the changes coming up. Building a strong relationship with yourself can make future relationships more fulfilling. If you're worried about loneliness, try deepening connections with friends or exploring new hobbies that bring you joy and community.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right path by identifying what you want to change. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for sharing your story - it takes courage to open up about these challenges. Let me address your main concerns:\n\nFor the porn/masturbation issue, rather than thinking of it as a permanent life change that you have to commit to forever (which can feel overwhelming), try taking it one day at a time. Each day is a fresh start. When urges come up, have a plan ready - go for a walk, do some pushups, call a friend, or work on a hobby. The key is replacing the habit with healthier coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety.\n\nRegarding dating, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. There's nothing wrong with taking a few months to focus on personal growth, especially given your upcoming moves. Use this time to build habits that make you feel good about yourself - the gym routine you've started is perfect. When you do date again, try to approach it with less emphasis on impressing others and more on genuine connection.\n\nFor maintaining habits long-term (like the gym), the key is starting small and being consistent rather than perfect. Instead of working out daily, maybe commit to 3 times a week so it's more sustainable when school starts. Same goes for alcohol - rather than trying to quit completely, set clear boundaries like \"only on weekends\" or \"max 2 drinks.\"\n\nRemember that building discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small, consistent improvements and getting back on track when you slip up. Focus on one change at a time rather than trying to transform everything at once. You've already taken positive steps by going to the gym and reducing drinking - that shows you're capable of making meaningful changes.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles and vulnerabilities with others, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of emotional, physical, and habitual challenges, but the fact that you're acknowledging them and seeking help is a huge step forward.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was your tendency to self-sabotage or fall back into old habits when things get tough. This is really common, especially when it comes to things like exercise, drinking, or porn use. One strategy that might help is to focus on building self-compassion and understanding why you're turning to these coping mechanisms in the first place. Instead of beating yourself up over setbacks, try to approach them with kindness and curiosity. Ask yourself what triggered the behavior, and what you can do differently next time.\n\nRegarding your concerns about dating and relationships, it might be helpful to take a step back and focus on building a stronger sense of self before diving into new relationships. This doesn't mean you have to give up on love or connection entirely, but rather that you prioritize getting to know yourself, your values, and what you want out of life. This can help you develop a sense of stability and confidence that will serve you well in any future relationships.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the NoFap journey. It's tough, and it's okay to slip up sometimes. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to quit cold turkey forever, try focusing on progress, not perfection. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be afraid to seek out support or resources when you need them.\n\nRemember, personal growth is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own needs and well-being above all else. You got this, and you're not alone.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now, but it's awesome that you're actively trying to improve things. It takes courage to face these issues head-on.\n\nRegarding the gym, instead of aiming for perfection right away, maybe focus on consistency. Even if it's just 2-3 times a week when school gets busy, that's way better than stopping completely. Think maintenance, not just transformation. Find something you enjoy doing at the gym too, that'll make it easier to stick with.\n\nCutting back on alcohol is a great goal. Maybe try finding some non-alcoholic drinks you enjoy so you have options when you're in social situations. It's okay to take it slow and celebrate small wins.\n\nThe porn/masturbation issue is tough, and it's super common. Don't beat yourself up about relapsing. Five days is a good start! Instead of thinking \"never again,\" maybe focus on smaller, achievable goals, like \"I'll go one day without it.\" Find other things to do when you feel the urge – go for a walk, read a book, call a friend. The fear of a \"life-changing decision\" is real, so break it down into smaller, manageable steps. There are some great resources in the r/NoFap community too.\n\nAs for dating, it's totally valid to feel exhausted by it. Maybe take a break and focus on building your own stability and happiness. You don't *need* a relationship to be happy. Use this time to explore your hobbies, connect with your friends, and just enjoy being you. When you feel more grounded, you can revisit dating if you want. It's okay to prioritize yourself right now, especially with the upcoming moves. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find \"the one,\" and that can make dating feel like a chore.\n\nJust remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs. Be kind to yourself, celebrate your wins, and learn from your setbacks. You've got this!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's tough to break, but the good news is that you can definitely turn things around with some small changes. First, try setting a specific time limit for your YouTube sessions, like 15-20 minutes, and use an app or timer to help you stick to it. Once the time's up, switch to one of the activities you love, even if it's just for 10 minutes. This way, you're gradually building the habit of transitioning from distractions to productive activities. Also, consider starting your day with a quick win—something small and easy from your list that you can accomplish right away. This can give you a sense of achievement and momentum to tackle more. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - breaking out of a procrastination loop is tough, but totally doable. The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum from there. Instead of making lists of everything you want to learn, pick ONE tiny thing to focus on first.\n\nFor example, if you want to read more, commit to reading just one page before touching your phone in the morning. That's it. One page. Make it so easy you can't say no. Put your phone in another room while you do it.\n\nFor the phone/YouTube habit, try installing a website blocker and setting specific times when you can watch videos. Cold turkey is rough - scheduling dedicated \"YouTube time\" makes it more manageable. You could do 25 minutes of focused activity (reading, drawing, whatever you picked), then allow yourself 5 minutes of videos as a reward.\n\nThe urges and distractions will still come up, but instead of beating yourself up, just notice them and gently redirect back to your chosen activity. Every time you do this, you're building that discipline muscle.\n\nRemember that change happens gradually. Focus on consistency over intensity. If you stick to even 5-10 minutes of deliberate practice each day, you'll be amazed at how things shift over a few weeks. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the pattern - now it's just about taking small actions to change it.",

Make it super concrete and manageable. Then, try to eliminate the distractions before they even become an issue. For example, you could delete YouTube from your phone or use a website blocker to limit your access to it during certain hours of the day. It might also be helpful to create a morning routine that gets you started on a positive note, like making a cup of coffee and reading for 10 minutes before even checking your phone. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to be perfect - so don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Just acknowledge it and try to do better the next day.

This could be something as simple as making your bed or doing a quick 5-minute stretch. \n\nTo help with motivation, try to establish a morning routine that you enjoy and look forward to, even if you wake up later than planned. This could include a favorite breakfast, a short walk, or listening to music you love. \n\nAs for fixing your sleep schedule, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I totally get the late wake-up struggle. The key is to not write off the whole day just because you woke up later than planned. Instead of letting a late start derail you, try this: As soon as you wake up (regardless of time), do one small productive thing right away. Make your bed, drink a glass of water, or do 5 minutes of stretching. This helps shake off that groggy feeling and builds momentum.\n\nFor fixing your sleep schedule, work backwards from when you need to wake up and set a firm bedtime. The trick is to keep this same sleep/wake schedule even on weekends. Your body will adjust within a few days if you're consistent.\n\nSome practical tips that help: Put your phone across the room so you have to get up to turn off the alarm. Open your curtains right when you wake up - natural light helps reset your body clock. And try to get some movement in within the first hour of waking, even if it's just a short walk.\n\nRemember - productivity isn't about perfect mornings, it's about making the most of whatever time you have.

Set a bedtime alarm (seriously, an alarm to *go* to bed) and stick to it, even if you're not tired. Dim the lights an hour before, and avoid screens. Consistency is key here.\n\nThird, when you wake up late, resist the urge to just \"go with it.\" Immediately do something that wakes you up and gets you moving. A quick shower, some jumping jacks, or even just splashing cold water on your face can help snap you out of that sluggish feeling.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Everyone has off days.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really committed to making a change, which is a great first step. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Create a Morning Ritual**: Since you used to wake up for your job, try to recreate that sense of urgency. Set a small task that you have to do immediately after waking up, like making your bed or doing a quick stretch. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to start the day.\n\n2. **Accountability Partner**: Find a friend or family member who can check in with you in the morning. Sometimes knowing someone else is counting on you can be a powerful motivator.\n\n3. **Gradual Change**: If waking up early is too big of a leap, try adjusting your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day. This can make the transition smoother and less daunting.\n\n4. **Reward System**: Give yourself a small reward for waking up on time. It could be something simple like enjoying a favorite breakfast or a few minutes of a hobby you love.\n\n5. **Reflect on Your Why**: Remind yourself why these exams are important to you. Visualize the benefits of passing them and how it will impact your future. This can help reignite that internal motivation.\n\nRemember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "It sounds like you've tried the technical solutions (alarms, apps, etc.) but the core issue is that sleepy-you is really good at sabotaging awake-you's plans. This is super common - your brain is excellent at finding loopholes when it wants more sleep!\n\nSince external motivation (like your old job) worked well before, let's create some immediate consequences for your morning routine. Here are a few approaches that have worked for others:\n\nGet an accountability partner. Tell your brother before he leaves that you'll send him a photo of yourself at your study desk by X time. If you don't, you owe him money or have to do his chores. Make the stakes real but reasonable.\n\nPut your alarm clock/phone across the room by your study materials. When you get up to turn it off, immediately sit at your desk and start your first task. Don't give yourself time to debate or rationalize - make it one fluid motion from alarm to studying.\n\nCreate a \"morning score\" system. Give yourself points for getting up on time and starting study by your target time. Lose points for oversleeping. Set weekly goals and reward yourself when you hit them (maybe with something you really want).\n\nThe key is breaking that moment where you decide to go back to bed. Once you're vertical and moving, stay that way. Splash cold water on your face, drink some water, do a few jumping jacks - whatever it takes to get past those crucial first few minutes when your sleepy brain is trying to talk you into \"just 5 more minutes.\"\n\nRemember: You don't have to feel motivated or energetic. You just have to not get back in bed. Start there, and build on small wins.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've tried some creative methods to wake yourself up, but you're still struggling to stick to your routine. One thing that might be worth exploring is identifying the underlying reasons why you're having such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. You mentioned that when you had a job, the fear of losing it was a strong motivator for you to wake up on time. Now that you don't have that external pressure, you might need to find an internal motivation to replace it.\n\nSince you're studying for competitive exams, you could try to remind yourself why waking up early is important for your goals. Write down your reasons for wanting to ace these exams and post them somewhere visible, like on your bedroom wall or fridge. This might help you connect with your motivations and give you a sense of purpose when your alarm goes off.\n\nIn terms of practical strategies, you could try making a plan for the first 10-15 minutes after you wake up that doesn't involve going back to bed. For example, you could make yourself a cup of coffee or tea, do some light stretching, or simply sit outside for a few minutes to get some fresh air. Having a small goal to achieve right away might help you build momentum and make it easier to stick to your routine.\n\nIt's also worth considering the environment you're waking up in. You mentioned that you leave your bed to lock the door after your brother leaves, but then you go back to bed. Could you try making your bedroom a space that's less conducive to sleeping? For example, you could open your curtains to let in natural light, or move your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's clear that you're frustrated with your current situation, but beating yourself up over it isn't going to help. Instead, try to focus on making small improvements each day and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they might seem. Good luck!",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've got the motivation to study, but your brain is playing tricks on you in the morning. It's super frustrating when you know what you *should* be doing, but you just can't seem to make it happen.\n\nIt seems like you're relying heavily on external motivators (alarms, etc.), but those are easy to defeat when you're half-asleep. Maybe try shifting your focus to internal motivation. You mentioned the fear of your ex-boss got you up. Can you tap into that feeling of responsibility or consequence, but apply it to your studies? Think about *why* you want to ace these exams. Visualize the positive outcome – the job, the financial security, the feeling of accomplishment. Really connect with that feeling before you go to bed.\n\nAlso, instead of just trying to brute force yourself awake, try making the morning more appealing. What if you prepped a really delicious breakfast the night before? Or had a favorite podcast or audiobook ready to go? Something you actually *look forward* to.\n\nAnother thing: maybe your study schedule is too rigid. If you're constantly failing to meet your goals, it can be demoralizing. Could you make it a little more flexible, so a late start doesn't completely derail your day? Even just shifting things around so the most important tasks are first thing might help.\n\nFinally, don't beat yourself up so much. Everyone slips up. The important thing is to learn from it and keep trying. Maybe keep a journal and track what works and what doesn't. You've got this!\n"

Dreams don't have expiration dates, and discipline isn't something you're \"blessed\" with - it's a skill you build, day by day.\n\nHere's what you can do right now: Pick one dream and break it down into small, manageable steps. Start with something you can do today, even if it's just 15 minutes of focused work. Tomorrow, do it again.

You are important, and your life matters, regardless of whether others are aware of your birthday or not.

It could be as simple as cooking your favorite meal, watching a movie you've been meaning to see, or taking a relaxing bath. \n\nAs for feeling like you're not making progress on your dreams, it's great that you're acknowledging the role of discipline in achieving your goals. Rather than beating yourself up over not having the discipline or talent yet, try breaking down your long-term goals into smaller, manageable tasks.

        "claude_comment": "First off, congrats on sticking with the gym for a month - that's a solid achievement! The post-workout fatigue you're experiencing is totally normal, especially when you're new to morning workouts. Here are a few tweaks that could help:\n\nMake sure you're getting enough quality sleep by going to bed early enough to support your 5:30 wake-up. Even if you can wake up naturally, your body needs consistent, adequate rest to recover from workouts.\n\nYour post-workout nutrition and hydration are crucial. Try having a small pre-workout snack (like a banana) and drinking water before the gym. After working out, eat a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs within 30 minutes - this helps with energy levels and recovery.\n\nConsider adjusting your workout intensity. You might be going too hard too soon. Start with moderate intensity and gradually increase it as your body adapts. This doesn't mean taking it easy - just being strategic about building up your stamina.\n\nFor the immediate post-gym sluggishness, try taking a cold shower right after. It's uncomfortable but really helps with alertness. Also, get into a routine of changing into fresh clothes and starting your day immediately after your shower, rather than letting yourself lounge.\n\nIf after trying these adjustments you're still struggling, you might want to experiment with different workout times. While evenings aren't an option for you, maybe try 7:30 or 8:00 AM for a few weeks and see if that helps with your energy levels throughout the day.\n\nRemember, it takes time for your body to adapt to a new routine.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're doing great by sticking to your morning gym routine for a month now, but it's definitely taking a toll on your energy levels. One thing you might want to consider is adjusting your post-workout routine to help you recover faster. For example, you could try having a protein shake or a light meal within 30-60 minutes after your workout to help replenish your energy stores. Additionally, making sure you're getting enough sleep and establishing a consistent bedtime routine could also help improve your overall energy levels throughout the day.\n\nIt might also be helpful to reassess your expectations for what you can accomplish immediately after your workout. It's not uncommon for people to feel tired or sluggish after exercise, especially if they're just starting out. Instead of trying to dive into college work or studies right away, maybe give yourself a bit of buffer time to relax and recharge. Even just taking a 30-minute break to grab a snack, take a shower, or simply sit down and collect your thoughts could make a big difference.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned you don't particularly enjoy going to the gym, it might be worth exploring ways to make your workouts more enjoyable or finding alternative forms of exercise that you do like. This could help make the experience less draining and give you something to look forward to. What do you think about trying some new exercises or activities to mix things up?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, congrats on sticking with the gym for a month! That's a solid start. It sounds like the morning workouts are just draining you for the rest of the day, which is counterproductive.\n\nA few things to consider: First, are you eating enough, especially protein and carbs, before and after your workouts? Fueling your body properly can make a huge difference in your energy levels. Experiment with different pre-workout snacks (like a banana with peanut butter or a protein shake) and make sure you're having a good post-workout meal to replenish your glycogen stores.\n\nSecond, maybe you're pushing yourself too hard at the gym. It's great to be dedicated, but if you're completely wiped out afterward, you might need to scale back the intensity or duration of your workouts. Try focusing on form and controlled movements rather than just trying to lift the heaviest weight possible. You could also try shorter, more focused workouts.\n\nThird, think about your sleep. Even though you're waking up early without an alarm, are you getting enough *quality* sleep? Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. A consistent sleep schedule can also help regulate your energy levels.\n\nFinally, since you mentioned you don't enjoy the gym, maybe explore other forms of exercise you might find more engaging. If you dread going, it's going to be harder to maintain the habit. Finding something you actually enjoy will make it easier to stick with it and might even give you more energy! Good luck!\n"

Not \"I'll finish this later\" but \"I'll do exactly X more minutes/pages/steps right now.\" Make it small enough that it feels almost ridiculous to quit. This builds momentum through small wins rather than relying on sustained motivation.\n\nFor breaking the procrastination loop, use the 5-minute rule. When you catch yourself thinking about doing something \"later,\" either start it for just 5 minutes right now, or explicitly schedule it (with a specific time) in your calendar. No vague \"tomorrows.\" This forces you to either commit or honestly acknowledge you're choosing not to do it.\n\nRemember: Future You will have the exact same struggles as Present You.

Make sure these chunks are so small that you can't say no to them - like 10-15 minutes of work. This way, you're not relying on feeling motivated or confident, but rather on a clear plan of action. Additionally, try to acknowledge and accept your past procrastination patterns, rather than beating yourself up over them.

Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not lazy. Procrastination isn't about laziness, it's about emotional regulation and habits. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you care deeply about improving.\n\nThe \"smart kid\" label can actually work against us sometimes. When things came easily before, we don't develop the skills to handle harder challenges. Now you're facing university-level work that requires different strategies.\n\nHere's what's worked for many chronic procrastinators:\n\nStart ridiculously small. Instead of \"I need to study for 3 hours,\" tell yourself \"I'll read one paragraph.\" Often you'll continue once you've started, but if not, that's fine - you met your goal. Build trust with yourself through these tiny wins.\n\nUse the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Don't worry about being perfect - even 10 minutes of focused work is better than nothing. There are great free apps for this.\n\nCreate a dedicated study space that's only for work. Your brain will start associating that space with productivity rather than procrastination.\n\nMost importantly: forgive yourself when you slip up. Beating yourself up creates more stress, which leads to more procrastination. Instead, treat each day as a fresh start.\n\nConsider talking to your university's academic support services. Many students struggle with this transition, and they have resources specifically for building better study habits.\n\nRemember: this is a skill you're developing, not a character flaw. With consistent small steps and self-compassion, you can absolutely turn this around.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and it's affecting your academic performance and self-esteem. First, let's acknowledge that having a full-ride scholarship is a huge opportunity, and it's great that you're recognizing the value of it. Now, about breaking the cycle of procrastination - it might be helpful to identify the underlying reasons why you're putting things off. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to overcome it. \n\nYou've tried using a planner, which is a great start. Another technique you could try is breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and setting specific deadlines for each one. This might help make your workload feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, you could try implementing the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n\nIt's also important to remember that motivation and energy aren't always going to be there, but discipline and habits can help carry you through. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try creating a routine and sticking to it, even when you don't feel like it. And hey, it's okay to not be perfect - it's better to make progress and learn from your mistakes than to let procrastination hold you back. You've already shown that you're capable of doing well when you put your mind to it, so let's build on that. What do you think is the smallest, most achievable step you could take today to start moving forward?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get it. That procrastination loop is brutal, especially when you know you're capable of more. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can actually make procrastination worse.\n\nFirst, cut yourself some slack. You're 19, figuring things out, and a C+ isn't the end of the world. It's a signal to adjust, not a reason to beat yourself up.\n\nSince planners haven't fully solved it, try breaking down your tasks into *tiny* steps. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of \"write essay,\" try \"open document and type my name.\" Seriously. The goal is to make the initial step so easy you can't say no. Once you've started, the momentum often carries you further.\n\nAlso, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique. Work in focused 25-minute bursts with short breaks. It can help with focus and make the task seem less daunting. There are tons of free apps for this.\n\nFinally, think about *why* you're procrastinating. Is it fear of failure? Boredom? If you can pinpoint the underlying reason, you can start to address it directly. Maybe talk to a counselor at your university; they're usually free and can offer strategies tailored to you. You've got this!\n"

      "body": "Hi guys,\nI’m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It’s bad because i’ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)",

It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. \n\nOne thing I will say is that it’s a journey. It’s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It’s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It’s going to happen, it’s going to be ok, and it does get better. \n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.",

But it’s a good place to start when trying to get on track. \n\nProtect your sleep. Do that by:\n\n- Going to bed at the same time every night. \n- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you’ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \n\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.",

When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. \n\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. \n\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through. \n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days.

Your 4-item daily list sounds really solid and manageable too.\n\nFor staying consistent while dealing with mental health challenges, I've found that treating slip-ups differently made a massive difference. Instead of viewing a missed day as a total reset, think of it like missing a meal - you wouldn't stop eating entirely just because you missed lunch, right? You'd just eat your next meal.\n\nA few practical tools that might help:\n\nThe \"Streaks\" app is great for tracking daily habits and gives you a visual of your progress. Having that reminder and seeing your streak build up can be really motivating.\n\nFor accountability, check out the Discord server for this subreddit (in the sidebar). There are channels specifically for daily check-ins and support. Having people to report to daily makes a big difference.\n\nOne technique that's helped me push through tough mental health days is the \"5-minute rule\" - commit to just 5 minutes of an activity. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you start, but if not, you still succeeded by doing those 5 minutes.\n\nStart tomorrow, but remember: progress isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that's completely normal. What matters is picking back up and continuing forward, even if it's just with those 5 minutes.",

You might find it helpful to track your progress in a journal or use an app like Habitica or HabitBull to monitor your habits and stay accountable.\n\nAdditionally, having a support system in place can make a huge difference. Since you're already in a therapy program, you might want to discuss your struggles with your therapist and see if they can offer any additional guidance or support. You could also consider joining online communities or forums for people with social anxiety disorder, where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection.

It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when tackling social anxiety, especially with the risk of slipping into depression.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is focusing on *progress, not perfection*. You mentioned that slipping once feels like a huge setback. Instead of viewing it that way, try to see it as a data point. If you miss a day, ask yourself *why*. Was the goal too ambitious? Were you too tired? Then adjust accordingly. Maybe break down your \"one social thing\" into even smaller, more manageable steps. Like, day 1: just walk to the store. Day 2: walk in and browse for 2 minutes. Day 3: ask an employee a question.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot. Celebrate the small wins. Did you meditate for 5 minutes instead of 10? Great! You still meditated.\n\nFor accountability, have you considered finding an online support group specifically for social anxiety? Sharing your experiences and challenges with others who understand can be incredibly validating and motivating. There are also habit tracking apps like Streaks or Habitica that can gamify the process and make it more engaging.\n\nFinally, remember that therapy is a marathon, not a sprint.

One thing that might help is to focus on building a routine that feels sustainable rather than going all-in right from the start.

This way, you're less likely to burn out.\n\nAlso, consider mixing up your workouts to keep things interesting. If you're an early morning person, maybe try different types of exercises that you can look forward to, like a new class or a run in a different location.

        "claude_comment": "This is a super common challenge - the initial motivation burst followed by burnout. The key is to shift from relying on motivation to building sustainable habits and systems.\n\nA few things that have worked well for maintaining long-term consistency:\n\nStart smaller than you think you need to. Instead of going all-out for 2-3 weeks, begin with a minimal routine you can definitely stick to (even 15-20 mins). You can always build up gradually.\n\nHave a clear \"if-then\" plan for your morning workouts. The more automatic you make it, the less willpower you need. Lay out clothes the night before, keep your gym bag ready, etc. Make the path of least resistance lead to working out.\n\nAccept that some days will feel \"meh\" and that's totally fine. You don't need to crush every workout. Simply showing up and doing something, even if it's lighter than usual, maintains the habit. Consistency > intensity.\n\nWhen you feel burnout coming, scale back instead of stopping completely. Do shorter workouts or lighter days, but keep the routine. It's much easier to maintain momentum than to start over.\n\nTrack your consistency rather than just results. Use a simple habit tracker or calendar. Seeing your streak can be motivating, and it helps identify patterns in when/why you tend to fall off.\n\nThe morning workout choice is smart - fewer disruptions and excuses. Just remember that discipline isn't about being perfect, it's about getting back on track quickly when you slip. Keep at it!",
        "llama_comment": "I think I can offer some insight here. It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern - starting strong with motivation, but then hitting a wall and struggling to maintain consistency. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Instead of trying to be \"all-in\" all the time, try to make your workouts a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. \n\nAlso, since you mentioned you prefer early morning workouts, try to make that time as convenient and enjoyable as possible. Lay out your workout clothes the night before, prep your breakfast, and find a playlist or podcast that gets you pumped up. As for avoiding burnout, consider incorporating rest days or active recovery into your routine, like a light yoga session or a walk. This can help your body and mind recharge, making it easier to stick to your workouts in the long run. \n\nLastly, try to focus on progress rather than perfection. It's okay to have off days or weeks, but don't let that derail you completely. Get back on track as soon as you can, and remind yourself why you started working out in the first place. You've already identified what works for you (early morning workouts), now it's just a matter of making it a sustainable habit.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That initial motivation is awesome, but it's a beast to maintain! Here's what's helped me stick with it long-term:\n\nFirst, ditch the \"all-in\" mentality. It's a recipe for burnout. Think sustainable, not spectacular. Instead of aiming for intense workouts every day, try scaling back. Maybe 3 days a week with shorter, less intense sessions. Consistency trumps intensity, especially in the long run.\n\nSecond, build in some flexibility. Life happens. Instead of letting a missed workout derail you for weeks, have a backup plan. Maybe a quick bodyweight circuit at home if you can't make it to the gym, or even just a brisk walk. The goal is to keep the momentum going, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nThird, find something you genuinely enjoy. If you dread your workouts, you're less likely to stick with them. Experiment with different activities until you find something that feels less like a chore and more like something you look forward to.\n\nFinally, track your progress. Seeing how far you've come can be a huge motivator. It doesn't have to be anything fancy – just a simple log of your workouts. When you feel like giving up, look back at your progress and remind yourself of how much you've already accomplished. Good luck, you got this!\n"

I guess the best thing to describe me is that I'm someone who's struggling to accept the fact that I'm not a kid anymore, and that even though I'm still very young in the grand scheme of things, I feel like I'm already set in place for one bad life.\n\nFor context, I grew up in an Asian household with strict, but fair and loving parents. I was your typical student who got A's and B's up until my sophomore year in HS where I basically gave up on it. Grades dropped and did only the very bare minimum to breeze through with a low C. I eventually only graduated because of COVID when my HS put in some VERY lenient standards for its students (for example, there was nothing that could lower your grade in classes. Not doing homework? Not showing up to those zoom calls? Perfect, my C in that class would remain unchanged). Woohoo class of 2020.\n\nSkipped the fall 2020 semester at my local CC because of my laziness and irresponsibility to register early. I did my first semester in Spring the following year and failed all my classes. Now I just missed this year's fall semester again because of the same reason before.\n\nNow, I'm unemployed with no driver's license. I have my fourth try in a couple weeks (I failed twice for stupid mistakes, and I couldn't even take it the third because my brakelight went out).

I have a horrible sleeping schedule (sleep at 4 AM, wake up at 2 PM).\n\nI've now realized that I'm a useless piece of shit mooching off of my parents with no sense of direction in life. I blame no one for how I am right now.

Adopt responsibility for a few things where people *really* rely on you to show up. This could be a job for a small business. This could be volunteering someplace. Whatever it is there has to be real negative consequences if you don't show or if you call in sick. It'll get you going so the days don't just slide by. It is a huge boost to have people rely on you and to be contributing in a real way to helping other people succeed. Progressively adopt more and more responsibility. It changes everything. \n2. Definitely quit the porn and probably the video games. Too much easy dopamine. Dopamine is what will get you out of bed and looking for work, trying new things, meeting people, etc. You don't want to use all of it up on stuff that isn't moving you forward.\n3. You are on the right track with a predictable and consistent daily schedule and some fitness habits. That made a big difference.

Keep building on those small wins. Maybe set a goal to wake up 15 minutes earlier each week until you reach a time that feels productive for you.\n\n2. **Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine.

Include time for exercise, chores, and maybe a new hobby or skill you want to learn.\n\n3. **Driver's License**: Keep at it with the driving test. It's frustrating, but passing it will give you more independence and open up job opportunities. Make sure your car is in good shape before the test to avoid any more hiccups.\n\n4. **Education and Work**: Consider reaching out to your local community college about re-enrolling. They might have resources to help you get back on track. Also, look into part-time jobs or volunteer work to gain experience and build a routine.\n\n5. **Limit Distractions**: You're already working on cutting down on porn and video games.

These are exactly the kind of small, consistent changes that build into bigger improvements. Keep building on these wins.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest focusing on next: Get that driver's license. You've already taken it three times, so you know what to expect. Study the common mistakes, practice the specific areas where you struggled, and knock it out. Having your license will open up more opportunities for both work and independence.\n\nFor college - most community colleges have academic counselors who specifically help students who've had a rough start. Set up an appointment with one. They can help you create a realistic plan to get back on track, and might even be able to help you appeal those failed grades. Lots of students struggled during COVID - you're not alone in this.\n\nThe key is to tackle one thing at a time. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick your next goal (like that driver's license), break it down into small daily tasks, and focus on those. Once you've got that handled, move on to the next thing.\n\nYou're already making positive changes. That's not someone who's \"doomed\" - that's someone who's starting to take control of their life.

What's the next step you can take towards getting your life on track? Is it studying for your driver's license test, looking for job openings, or registering for classes again?

Small wins build momentum.\n\nHere's my advice: focus on *one* thing at a time. You mentioned the driver's license. Nail that. Seriously, make it your mission. Study the handbook, watch YouTube videos, practice driving every day if you can. Getting that license will be a tangible win and give you a confidence boost.

Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Set a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.\n\n2. **Create a Morning Routine**: Having a routine can give you something to look forward to. Maybe start with a quick stretch or a glass of water to kickstart your day.\n\n3. **Use an Alarm Clock Strategically**: Place your alarm clock across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. This can help you resist the temptation to hit snooze.\n\n4. **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: The blue light from screens can interfere with your sleep. Try to wind down with a book or some relaxing music instead.\n\n5. **Find an Accountability Partner**: Maybe a friend or roommate who also wants to wake up early. You can motivate each other to stick to your goals.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to adjust, so be patient with yourself. Good luck with your studies!",
        "claude_comment": "Getting out of bed immediately is tough for most people, especially without external accountability like parents. Here's what's worked really well for me and others:\n\nPut your phone/alarm across the room so you physically have to get up to turn it off. Once you're standing, half the battle is won. \n\nThe other key is to make your morning routine something you actually look forward to. Maybe start with 5 minutes of light stretching, put on your favorite music, or treat yourself to a special morning drink. Having a compelling reason to get up makes a huge difference.\n\nAlso, the morning really starts the night before. Try to get to bed at a consistent time that gives you 7-8 hours of sleep. Your body will naturally start waking up earlier once you establish a rhythm.\n\nFor the first week, you might need to be a bit extreme - set multiple alarms, have a friend call you, or even arrange to meet someone at the library at 8am sharp. Once you build the habit and experience the benefits of those productive morning hours, it gets much easier to maintain.\n\nRemember that it's normal to need 2-3 weeks to cement a new habit. Stay consistent and don't beat yourself up if you slip up occasionally. You've already shown you can wake up early - now it's just about creating the right environment and systems to make it happen consistently.",
        "llama_comment": "Waking up early can be tough, especially when you're in a new environment. One strategy that might help is to establish a consistent morning routine that you enjoy, so you've got something to look forward to as soon as you wake up. This could be as simple as making yourself a cup of coffee or tea, doing some quick exercises, or reading something inspiring. Try to make your mornings feel rewarding, rather than just a chore to get to the library. \n\nAlso, since you're used to waking up at 4 am at home, waking up at 6 am might feel like sleeping in, which could be contributing to your tendency to hit the snooze button. You might want to try setting your alarm 15-30 minutes earlier each day and see if you can gradually train yourself to get out of bed as soon as it goes off. Additionally, make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, as lack of sleep can make it harder to wake up in the morning. \n\nLastly, consider making a plan for your morning the night before, including what time you need to wake up, what you'll do as soon as you get out of bed, and what you need to bring with you to the library. Having a clear plan can help you stay on track and make it easier to get out of bed when your alarm goes off.

Once you're up, you're less likely to crawl back into bed.\n\nSecond, have something you're actually looking forward to doing in the morning. Maybe it's a specific chapter you want to read, or a coffee you really enjoy. Having a reason to get up makes it easier.\n\nThird, prep the night before. Lay out your clothes, pack your bag, maybe even make your lunch. The less you have to think about in the morning, the smoother your transition to the library will be.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. It takes time to adjust to a new environment and build new habits. Don't get discouraged if you slip up, just keep trying! Good luck with your studies!\n"

The key is to make it easier for your morning self to succeed rather than relying on willpower alone.\n\nFirst, work backwards from your wake time to set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep. Your body clock needs regularity to adapt. Even on weekends, try not to deviate by more than an hour.\n\nPut your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. The moment your feet hit the floor, immediately walk to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face. This combination of movement and sensation helps shake off the grogginess.\n\nWhat helped me was having a specific reason to get up early - something more compelling than just \"I should.\" Maybe it's hitting the gym when it's empty, enjoying a peaceful breakfast, or getting a head start on work. Whatever motivates you.\n\nAlso, make your bedroom a wake-up friendly environment. Get a sunrise alarm clock or put your lights on a timer. The gradual increase in light helps your body transition naturally from sleep. Keep the room slightly cool too - it's harder to get up when you're cozy and warm.\n\nRemember that the first week will be the hardest.

Once you understand the root cause, you can develop a plan to address it. For example, if you're not a morning person, try setting a goal that's rewarding to you, like enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or doing some stretching exercises. It's also important to create an environment that supports your goals, such as placing your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule, and it's understandable how that can spiral into other areas of life. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Gradual Adjustment**: Instead of trying to reset your sleep schedule all at once, try shifting it gradually. Aim to go to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can be more sustainable and less jarring for your body.\n\n2. **Consistent Routine**: Establish a consistent bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, taking a warm shower, or practicing relaxation techniques.\n\n3. **Limit Screen Time**: Try to reduce exposure to screens at least an hour before bed. The blue light emitted by phones and computers can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n4. **Natural Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure during the day, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your internal clock and improve your mood.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Consider sharing your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware of your efforts can be motivating.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned ADHD, it might be worth discussing your sleep issues with a healthcare professional. They can offer tailored advice and support.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - this is a tough situation but it's fixable. The combination of no structure, ADHD, and a completely flipped sleep schedule is creating a nasty cycle, but let's break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, you need to pick a realistic wake time and stick to it no matter what. Not 4am - that's too aggressive. Maybe start with 11am since that worked better for you before. Get a super loud alarm and put it across the room so you physically have to get up.\n\nThe key is to stay up the entire day after you wake up. No naps. It'll suck for 1-2 days but it's necessary. As soon as you wake up, get outside for at least 15 minutes of sunlight. This helps reset your circadian rhythm. \n\nFor the first few days, take melatonin about 2 hours before your target bedtime (aim for midnight initially). The goal is to gradually move your schedule earlier, not fix it all at once.\n\nTo maintain the schedule, you need some daily structure. Even with online classes, set specific times to watch lectures, do coursework, etc. Put everything in your calendar and treat it like real appointments. This is especially important with ADHD - external structure is your friend.\n\nAbout the lies - people are generally understanding about sleep issues. You don't have to share details, but a simple \"I've been struggling with my sleep schedule and working to fix it\" is better than keeping track of multiple stories.\n\nThe most important thing is to be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. Your body will eventually adjust, but you have to push through those first few difficult days. You've got this - one step at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule and the lies you've been telling to cover it up are adding to your stress. First, let's tackle the sleep issue - with your ADHD, it might be helpful to establish a consistent daily routine that doesn't rely on willpower alone. Consider setting multiple alarms throughout the day to help regulate your wake-up time, and try to get some morning sunlight exposure as soon as you wake up to help reset your circadian rhythms.\n\nSince you've been able to wake up at 8am for work in the past, you might be able to use that as a reference point to start rebuilding your schedule. Try setting a realistic goal, like waking up at 10am or 11am, and gradually adjust it to an earlier time as your body adjusts. It's also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches.\n\nAs for the lies, it might be helpful to start small by being honest with one person you trust about your situation. This can help take some of the weight off your shoulders and give you a sense of accountability. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're not alone in struggling with sleep and ADHD - many people have been in your shoes before.

It's great that you're reaching out and recognizing you want to change things.\n\nFirst, stop beating yourself up about the lies. It's a coping mechanism, and now you're ready to move past it. The important thing is to focus on building a consistent routine.\n\nSince you mentioned ADHD, have you explored strategies specifically for sleep with ADHD? Things like a super consistent bedtime routine (even on weekends), blackout curtains, white noise, and avoiding screens an hour or two before bed can make a difference. Melatonin might help, but definitely talk to your doctor about that, especially given your ADHD.\n\nThe biggest thing is consistency. Even if you have a terrible night, try to wake up at the same time. It sucks at first, but it's key to resetting your circadian rhythm. Maybe aim for a slightly earlier wake time each day, even by 15-30 minutes, until you get closer to a reasonable hour.\n\nAlso, think about light exposure. Get bright light first thing when you wake up (a sunlight lamp can be a lifesaver in winter). And try to avoid bright light in the evening.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. It's not going to fix itself overnight. Celebrate small wins, and don't get discouraged if you slip up. Just get back on track the next day. You got this!\n"

Only bring it back during designated break times. This creates a physical barrier between you and the temptation.\n\nTo tackle the instant gratification mindset, try keeping a \"wins journal.\" At the end of each day, write down what you accomplished and how it moves you toward your bigger goals. This helps connect your daily efforts to the long-term rewards. You could also set up small rewards for hitting study milestones - like \"after 2 hours of focused work, I can watch one episode of my favorite show.\"\n\nRemember that discipline is like a muscle - it gets stronger with consistent training.

For example, you could try taking regular breaks to do something enjoyable, but still productive, like going for a walk or practicing a hobby. This can help you feel like you're getting a reward without derailing your progress. It might also be helpful to establish some ground rules for yourself when it comes to using the internet and your phone while studying - like setting a specific block of time where you'll focus on work, and then taking a break to check your phone or browse the internet.

Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Sleep Quality**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep at night. If you're waking up at 5 am, aim for a bedtime that gives you 7-9 hours of sleep. Quality matters too, so try to keep your sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet.\n\n2. **Morning Routine**: Start your day with some light exercise or stretching. This can help wake up your body and mind, setting a positive tone for the day.\n\n3. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Drink water first thing in the morning and keep hydrated throughout the day. Eating a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs can also help maintain your energy levels.\n\n4. **Breaks and Movement**: Incorporate short breaks into your study sessions. A quick walk or some light stretching can boost your energy and focus.\n\n5. **Power Nap**: If possible, a short nap (10-20 minutes) around midday can recharge you without affecting your nighttime sleep.\n\n6. **Caffeine Timing**: If you use caffeine, try to have it in the morning and avoid it in the afternoon to prevent disrupting your sleep cycle.\n\nAdjusting to a new routine takes time, so be patient with yourself.

The mid-day crash you're experiencing is pretty common when adjusting to early mornings. Here's what can help:\n\nFirst, make sure you're actually getting enough total sleep. Even with a 5am wake-up, you should aim for 7-8 hours, which means lights out by 9-10pm. No screens for at least 30 mins before bed.\n\nFor the mid-day slump specifically: Try taking a 15-20 minute power nap around 10:30am (before the crash hits). This can be incredibly refreshing and won't interfere with nighttime sleep. If naps aren't possible, get up and do 5 minutes of physical activity - jumping jacks, quick walk, or stretching when you start feeling drowsy.\n\nYour eating patterns matter too. Have a protein-rich breakfast and avoid heavy carb-loaded lunches that'll make you sleepy. Keep healthy snacks like nuts or fruit handy for steady energy. Stay hydrated throughout the day.\n\nConsider breaking your study sessions into 45-minute chunks with 5-10 minute breaks. During peak drowsiness (11-12), switch to more active learning methods like explaining concepts out loud or working through practice problems instead of passive reading.\n\nGive these adjustments a try for a week and see what works best for you.

To combat mid-day drowsiness, have you considered taking a short walk or doing some light exercise around 10-11 am to get your blood flowing and oxygen levels up? Sometimes, a change of scenery or a bit of physical activity can help increase alertness. Additionally, make sure you're staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the morning, and try to avoid heavy meals or sugary snacks that can cause an energy crash later on. You might also experiment with taking a 10-15 minute power nap if you're feeling extremely fatigued, but set an alarm so you don't oversleep. As for studying productivity, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between - this can help you stay focused and retain information better. What's your current study routine like, and are there any specific subjects or tasks that seem to be causing your productivity to plummet?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey! Congrats on sticking with the 5 am wake-up for three weeks, that's a solid achievement! That mid-day slump is super common, especially when adjusting to a new sleep schedule.\n\nA few things that might help: First, make sure you're getting enough *total* sleep. Even with the early wake-up, aim for 7-8 hours. Maybe you need to adjust your bedtime earlier to compensate.\n\nSecond, look at your diet. A heavy, carb-loaded lunch can definitely make you sleepy. Try something lighter with protein and healthy fats. Also, stay hydrated! Dehydration can mimic fatigue.\n\nThird, consider a short break with some light exercise around 10:30-11 am. A quick walk, some jumping jacks, or even just stretching can really boost your energy levels.\n\nFinally, experiment with different study techniques. If you're grinding for hours straight, your brain will naturally get tired. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break) to break things up. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "It's almost two months from the day I told myself to change for the better, physically, mentally and academically. But as typical of me, I've done nothing but put it off. \"O I'll start Tomorrow, today my study table is not in order\" then tomorrow comes and I put it off to the next. In doing so I kinda lost believe and faith in myself.\n\nI've basically wasted the last 6 years of my life. And I've gotten so accustomed to this current state of being--lazy, unmotivated, no plans, unemployed, obese, depressed,anxious--that any move towards a positive change scared me. Am afraid of change and what lies beyond. \n\nI know am supposed to be hitting the gym, I know am supposed to be ahead of the teacher, I know I should diet. But for some strange reason I can't move forward. It all sounds good in my head but I cant put it to action. its like am in invisible shackles.  So far am 20 chapters behind and we're in the final stretch of the semester and am still procrastinating.\n\nMy self sabotage is beyond belief. I know what am supposed to do and I know how guilty I would feel if i don't do it. But I still don't do what's required of me.  \nAlso I got an extreme 12hr/day phone addiction. And am currently afraid for my future. Will I be stuck for the next 6 years?\n\nAnd finally am afraid of what lies beyond, the uncertainty kills me. Am so deep into my comfort zone, which consists of nothing but bad habits,e.g in bed 24/7 with my phone glued to me. It feels like I've been stripped of my manhood. I'll always  choose the path of least resistance. \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.",

That will give you some wins under your belt and you'll start believing that change is possible after all, which will give you energy to continue and expand to add another thing to your daily to do list. What you do and how often and how much is up to you. The more effort, the faster the results. The balancing act is adding a many things to your to do list without feeling overwhelm.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. That’s a big step in itself. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you don’t have to tackle everything at once. Start small. Pick one thing you want to change and focus on that. Maybe it’s reducing your phone time by an hour a day or setting a timer for 10 minutes to tidy up your study space. Small wins can build momentum.\n\nFor the fear of the unknown, try to reframe it as curiosity. What if the changes you make lead to something amazing? You don’t have to have it all figured out. Just take one step at a time. Also, consider setting up some accountability. Maybe a friend or a study group can help keep you on track.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Change is hard, and setbacks are part of the process. Celebrate the small victories and keep moving forward. You’ve got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many people get stuck in these cycles of procrastination and self-sabotage, especially when facing big changes. The good news is you can absolutely break free from this pattern.\n\nStart incredibly small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Instead of thinking about hitting the gym for an hour, commit to doing just 5 pushups today. Instead of trying to study for hours, commit to reading just one page. The key is making the initial action so ridiculously easy that your brain can't come up with excuses.\n\nFor your phone addiction, start by creating physical distance between you and your phone. Put it in another room when you sleep. Set specific times to check it. Use app blockers if needed. Each time you resist checking your phone, you're building that discipline muscle.\n\nAbout those 20 chapters - break them into tiny chunks. Read one section, then take a 5-minute break. Don't think about all 20 chapters. Just focus on the next small piece in front of you.\n\nThe fear of change is normal, but remember: your comfort zone is actually pretty uncomfortable right now. You're not really comfortable - you're just familiar with the discomfort. Real comfort comes from knowing you're moving in the right direction, even if it's just baby steps.\n\nPick ONE thing to change this week. Just one. Make it tiny. Maybe it's drinking water first thing in the morning, or reading for 5 minutes before bed. Build from there. Success breeds success, and small wins lead to bigger ones.\n\nYou haven't lost your manhood or your potential. You're just stuck in a rut, and ruts can be climbed out of. Start climbing today, one small handhold at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with getting started and making progress towards your goals, and it's understandable that the fear of the unknown and self-sabotage are holding you back. One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks - instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of \"hitting the gym\" or \"being ahead of the teacher\", try setting a goal for yourself like \"go for a 10-minute walk today\" or \"read one chapter of my textbook tonight\". This can make it feel less daunting and more achievable. \n\nIt's also important to recognize that you don't have to make all these changes at once - you can start with small steps, like putting your phone away for an hour a day or getting out of bed 30 minutes earlier than usual. And instead of beating yourself up over your phone addiction, try to see it as an opportunity to learn and grow - you could try replacing some of that phone time with something more productive, like reading or journaling.\n\nAs for the fear of what lies beyond, it might help to remind yourself that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and that it's okay to not have everything figured out. You don't have to have a perfect plan - just taking small steps towards your goals can help you build momentum and confidence. And it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around your \"comfort zone\" - instead of seeing it as a source of comfort, try to see it as a limitation that's holding you back.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to find some accountability and support - whether it's a friend or family member, or an online community like this one. Having people to report to and get encouragement from can make a big difference in staying motivated and on track. Remember that overcoming self-sabotage and building new habits takes time and effort, but it's possible - and you've already taken the first step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed when you're trying to change a lot at once.\n\nInstead of trying to overhaul everything immediately, how about focusing on one tiny win each day? Seriously, *tiny*. Like, instead of \"hit the gym,\" maybe it's just \"put on my gym shoes.\" Or instead of \"diet,\" it's \"drink a glass of water before grabbing my phone.\" These small victories build momentum and confidence.\n\nRegarding the phone addiction, 12 hours is a lot. Try setting a timer for 30 minutes of focused phone use, then put it in another room for an hour. Gradually increase the \"away\" time. There are also apps that can help limit your usage.\n\nAs for the fear of the unknown, remember that *everyone* feels that way. You're not alone. Maybe try journaling about your fears. Writing them down can make them seem less scary. And instead of focusing on the big picture, concentrate on the next small step.\n\nYou mentioned being behind in your studies.

Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock. Also, consider writing down your thoughts before bed. Sometimes just getting them out on paper can help clear your mind. If you find yourself fixating on your heartbeat, try focusing on your breath instead. Slow, deep breaths can be calming and help shift your focus. Lastly, limit screen time before bed, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep. It might take some time, but with consistency, these habits can make a difference. Hang in there!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I dealt with similar sleep anxiety and intrusive thoughts, especially that hyper-awareness of bodily sensations at night. Here's what helped me break that cycle:\n\nFirst, establish a proper wind-down routine that starts 1-2 hours before bed. The key is consistency. Put away screens, dim the lights, and do calm activities like reading or light stretching. This signals to your brain that it's time to shift gears.\n\nInstead of trying to force yourself not to think about certain things (which usually backfires), try the \"worry journal\" technique. Before your bedtime routine, write down any anxious thoughts or concerns. This helps get them out of your head and onto paper, where you can deal with them tomorrow.\n\nFor the physical anxiety symptoms, try this breathing exercise: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Do this 4-5 times. It helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which naturally calms you down.\n\nIf you catch yourself fixating on your heartbeat or other sensations, gently redirect your attention to the feeling of your mattress supporting you, or the texture of your blanket. Don't fight the thoughts - just keep redirecting your focus whenever you notice them.\n\nRemember that your heart is an autonomous organ that's been doing its job perfectly well your whole life, including every night while you sleep. Your attention isn't required for it to keep working.\n\nStart implementing these strategies gradually. Pick one or two to try first, then add more as you get comfortable. It takes time to rewire these patterns, but it absolutely can be done with consistent practice.",
        "llama_comment": "I've been in similar shoes and it can be really tough to break the cycle of anxiety and intrusive thoughts at night. One thing that helped me was to establish a consistent bedtime routine that signals to my brain that it's time to wind down - this could be as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some light stretches. The key is to find something that relaxes you and doesn't involve screens for at least an hour before bed. \n\nRegarding your fixation on your heartbeat, it might be helpful to try a technique called \"paradoxical intention\" - instead of trying to distract yourself from the sensation, deliberately focus on it, but with a twist: try to observe it without any judgment or attachment. Tell yourself that it's okay to feel your heart beating, and that it's a normal, natural sensation. This can help take away some of the anxiety associated with it.\n\nIt's also worth considering keeping a thought journal beside your bed, where you can jot down any intrusive thoughts that come up as soon as you lie down. Sometimes getting them down on paper can help you process and release them, making it easier to clear your mind for sleep. Don't worry too much about the guided meditation not working every time - it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Keep trying different techniques, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. It takes time and patience to develop new habits and learn to manage anxiety, but it is possible to get there.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I've been there, and it sucks. That nighttime anxiety spiral is the worst. A few things that have helped me, and might be worth a shot for you:\n\nFirst, try to establish a really solid wind-down routine. I know you've tried meditation, but maybe experiment with *when* you do it. Instead of right before bed, try an hour or two before. This gives your mind a chance to process things a bit earlier, rather than right when you're trying to shut down. Also, make sure your bedroom is a true sanctuary – cool, dark, and quiet.\n\nSecond, address the heart-fixation thing directly. It sounds weird, but sometimes acknowledging the absurdity of the thought helps. Tell yourself, \"Okay brain, I hear you, you're worried about my heart. But my heart is a machine, it's been doing this my whole life, and it's not going to stop just because I'm not thinking about it.\" Sounds silly, but it can break the cycle.\n\nThird, and this is the discipline part: if you're still awake after, say, 20-30 minutes, *get out of bed*. Don't just lie there stewing. Go to another room, read a boring book (not on a screen!), or do some light stretching. Only go back to bed when you feel genuinely sleepy. This helps your brain associate your bed with sleep, not anxiety.\n\nFinally, if this is a persistent problem, consider talking to a doctor or therapist. They might have other strategies or be able to rule out any underlying medical issues. Good luck, you got this!\n"

You might also want to book a session with a trainer - they can show you proper form and help create a workout plan that matches your current fitness level.\n\nAs for staying consistent with both diet and exercise, external motivation is helpful but building habits is what really makes it stick. Start small - maybe commit to just 15 minutes at the gym three times a week. Once that becomes routine, gradually increase it. Same goes for diet - you're already cutting processed foods, which is great.

The good news is this is totally fixable with some adjustments to your routine.\n\nFirst, take a strategic break - not just Netflix, but actual recovery activities. Go for a 30-minute walk outside daily, do some light exercise, or try meditation. These activities help reset your mental state much better than passive entertainment.\n\nFor your lectures, try changing how you engage with the material. Instead of just writing everything down, focus on understanding the big picture first. Take rough notes during class, then spend 15 minutes after each lecture organizing them into a format that makes sense to you. This can make dry content more digestible.\n\nWhen you return to studying, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. This prevents mental fatigue and makes the work feel more manageable. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer 30-minute break.\n\nRegarding coffee - when it stops working, that's a sign you need real rest, not more stimulants. Try scaling back to just one cup in the morning, and replace other coffee breaks with water and short walks.\n\nThe key is to build sustainable study habits rather than pushing yourself to exhaustion.

If it's the dry lectures, see if you can find supplementary resources that make the topics more engaging, like video explanations or study groups. And don't rely solely on coffee for energy; try getting some fresh air, eating nutritious food, and staying hydrated. Exercise, even just a little each day, can also be a great energizer.

Normally I get into my bad habits at night where I would just watch youtube videos and play video games with some people that may be ok to do but for me, I think it leads to more bad habits that I have like masturbation and watching porn because I get too comfortable at home and therefore start doing bad habits at night and then it leads me getting discouraged because of what I did.

        "gpt_comment": "Exploring new activities at night can be a great way to break out of those habits. Here are a few ideas you might find interesting: \n\n1. **Join a Class or Group**: Look for evening classes or meetups in your area. It could be anything from dance, art, or cooking classes to language exchange meetups. This not only keeps you busy but also helps you meet new people.\n\n2. **Nighttime Photography**: If you have a camera or even a smartphone, try nighttime photography. Exploring your city or neighborhood at night can be a whole new experience and a creative outlet.\n\n3. **Volunteer**: Some organizations have evening volunteer opportunities. It’s a fulfilling way to spend your time and can help you connect with others.\n\n4. **Go for a Night Walk or Run**: If you enjoy walking during the day, try it at night. Just make sure to choose safe, well-lit areas. It can be quite peaceful and a good way to clear your mind.\n\n5. **Visit a Late-Night Café or Bookstore**: Some places stay open late and can be a nice change of scenery. You can enjoy a drink, people-watch, or even write if you’re into journaling.\n\n6. **Explore Local Events**: Check out local event listings for concerts, open mic nights, or other community events. It’s a good way to experience something new and maybe even discover a new hobby.\n\nRemember, the key is to find activities that you genuinely enjoy and that keep you engaged. It might take some experimenting, but that’s part of the fun!",
        "claude_comment": "Here are some evening activities that can help you stay productive and avoid falling into those habits you're trying to break:\n\nEvening classes are great - many community centers and gyms offer night programs like martial arts, dance, or cooking classes. These give you structure and let you develop new skills while meeting people.\n\nIf you enjoy being active, look for evening sports leagues or running groups. Many cities have recreational volleyball, basketball, or soccer leagues that play in the evenings. Some running stores organize evening group runs too.\n\nFor solo activities, try finding a 24-hour gym, taking night photography walks (cities look amazing at night), or finding a late-night cafe to work on creative projects. Some libraries and coffee shops are open late too.\n\nYou could also volunteer - lots of organizations need evening help, like animal shelters, food banks, or community centers. This gets you out of the house while doing something meaningful.\n\nThe key is having specific destinations and activities planned ahead of time. When you know exactly where you're going and what you're doing, you're less likely to default to staying home.\n\nRemember that your home doesn't have to be just for \"relaxing\" - you can create different zones for different activities. But if getting out works better for you right now, that's totally valid. Focus on building that evening routine with activities you genuinely enjoy.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're looking for ways to stay engaged and avoid falling into bad habits on weekend nights. One approach could be to find activities that are similar to what you enjoy during the day, but with a nighttime twist. For example, instead of going to a coffee shop during the day, you could try visiting a board game cafe or an escape room at night. These types of places often have a social atmosphere, but you can still participate as a solo individual. \n\nAlternatively, you might consider exploring your local community's nightlife by attending concerts, comedy shows, or other events that interest you. Many cities also have nighttime walking tours or outdoor activities like stargazing that can be a great way to get out of the house and enjoy the evening. If you're looking for something more low-key, you could try visiting a bookstore or a record store that's open late, or even just taking a walk in a new neighborhood to discover new sights and sounds.\n\nAs for what others do on their days off, it really varies - some people enjoy outdoor activities like hiking or biking, while others might prefer visiting museums or trying out new restaurants. The key is to find things that you enjoy and that help you feel fulfilled, rather than just defaulting to habits that don't serve you well. It might take some experimentation to find what works for you, but it sounds like you're motivated to make a change, which is a great first step.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you've got a good handle on identifying your triggers and are actively looking for solutions, which is awesome! It's great that you recognize the pattern of being home leading to unwanted habits.\n\nFor nighttime activities outside the house, how about exploring some options that are different from your daytime routine? Since you're already hitting the gym and learning, maybe try something more social or creative. Think about things like:\n\n*   **Live music or open mic nights:** Even if you go alone, it's a chance to be around people and experience something new.\n*   **Board game cafes:** Many have solo players nights or are just generally welcoming to newcomers.\n*   **Night photography:** Grab your phone or a camera and explore your city's lights. It's a cool way to see familiar places in a new light.\n*   **Volunteer:** Some organizations have evening opportunities, like serving meals or helping at animal shelters.\n\nAs for what I do on my days off, I'm a big fan of trying new restaurants or going to see movies (especially at those theaters with the comfy reclining seats!). Sometimes just wandering around a different part of town can be surprisingly fun.\n\nThe key is to experiment and find what clicks for you. Don't be afraid to try something and decide it's not for you – that's part of the process. Good luck, you got this!\n"

You could also try setting a specific morning routine that you look forward to, like making a nice breakfast or doing a quick workout.

If you still want to use your phone as an alarm, consider using apps that lock you out of social media for a set period after waking up. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Here's what helped me break the morning doomscrolling habit - get a cheap alarm clock from Amazon (they're like $10-15) and charge your phone in another room overnight. This creates a physical barrier between you and social media first thing in the morning.\n\nThe key is making the desired behavior (getting up and starting your day) easier than the undesired behavior (scrolling). When your phone isn't right next to you, you have to actually get up and walk to it, which gives your brain a chance to wake up and make more intentional decisions.\n\nIf you absolutely must keep your phone as your alarm, try putting it across the room so you have to get up to turn it off. Then immediately go do your morning routine before touching any apps. You can also use app blockers that prevent social media access during certain hours - this adds another barrier between you and the scroll.\n\nRemember that the first few minutes after waking really set the tone for your whole day. Instead of letting social media dictate that tone, take control by establishing a simple morning sequence - maybe just \"alarm off → bathroom → water → stretch\" to start. Keep it super basic at first and build from there once it becomes automatic.",
        "llama_comment": "One strategy you could try is setting your alarm across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off - this way, you're already up and moving before you even touch your phone. Alternatively, you could use an alarm app that has a feature like \"no snooze\" or one that requires you to complete a task before you can check your notifications. As for the doomscrolling itself, try setting a specific goal for your morning routine, like making your bed or brushing your teeth, and challenge yourself to get that done before you're allowed to check social media. It might also be helpful to replace the social media scrolling with something else, like reading a book, meditating, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee - give yourself something better to look forward to in the mornings.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get the doomscrolling struggle. It's a tough habit to break! Here's a couple things that might help:\n\nFirst, the classic: phone across the room. Seriously, if you have to physically get out of bed to turn off the alarm, you're already winning.\n\nSecond, try changing your phone's home screen. Bury those tempting social media apps in a folder on the *last* page. Replace them with something boring but useful, like a calendar or a notes app with your to-do list. Out of sight, out of mind (at least for a few crucial minutes).\n\nThird, and this might sound weird, but try setting a *second* alarm for 15-20 minutes after your first one. Use that first alarm as the \"get out of bed\" alarm, and the second as a backup. Knowing you have a little buffer might reduce the anxiety that leads to scrolling.\n\nFinally, and this is the most important: have a plan for what you *will* do instead of scrolling. \"Go take a shit like a normal person\" is a good start, but maybe add something else right after, like \"drink a glass of water\" or \"stretch for 5 minutes.\" Having a positive alternative makes it way easier to resist the urge to doomscroll.

No matter how hard I tried, it actually seemed to set my parents off faster. But its good you see it and want to change it, that's huge. So congrats on that part. In my adult life I refuse to argue with people, and by extension be yelled at or yell back and forth. If it's something that needs to be talked about, it will be talked about after both parties take a breather and are at the point of actually talking to each other. Until then, the subject needs to be left alone. If it's something that can be left as \"agree to disagree\" then sometimes that is best. It wasn't an easy learning process, but I've learned you'll say things while angry that you don't necessarily mean and then that festers until it gets brought up. Normally out of nowhere. Learning to deal with your emotions so They don't control you in certain situations would help. That would differ from person to person though. But thats what helped me, and ultimately helped with me choosing not to argue with people. What others still continue to try and do is nothing I can control, remember that.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I came to live with my husband over 12 years ago. We were still bf and gf back then. I came from a yelling-everything family and I brought the yelling in this household too. It wasn't always arguing, but simply different views. \n\nI am maybe lucky to have the partner I do, that kept calm and never yelled back. Took me years to unlearn the yelling after over 20 years of it being something normal. These last 2 years I can't remember yelling once, but I might remember smth before these 2 years. \n\nIt is an urge deep inside, but it comes easy with practicing few steps, especially when you are the one engaging someone else in conversation:\n\n1. Think of what you need to say and if it is actually important saying. Sometimes we act out of impulse, giving 0 thoughts to how this might carry on. \n\n2. Do you really need a feedback on something or you already know what's to be expected from the other person? In the intimacy of a family, you already know, from past emcounters what the other person wants or needs or what view has. Some questions make others wander if you are actually listening to them and it gets frustrating to know you pay no attention and, coming back to them with a similar situation or question, may fuel some negative feeling. This is why thinking on past situations might help. \n\n3. Know, before engaging with anyone in a conversation, that voices might be raised. Allow yourself to calm down first (because knowing what will come will give you a start-up of your own \"bubbling\" even before you say the first word). It is important to forgive the other person even before they yell at you. It is even best when you go into a conversation with this positive attitude and no one is yelling. For me, this was amazing. Now I rarely feel joy about it :) ...well, because no one is yelling anymore these days haha!\n\n4. Confirmation. This is important for a person that yells. Going into a conversation with this type of people (and I know, because I was one too) is to approve what they say if you indeed approve with them. This should be the only way to talk back to them before getting a chance to speek as well. Let them speak/yell what they need to \"let out\" and till they are finished, just tell them \" I agree with that view too\" (or something similar, depending what it is said), or even nodding helps, while they talk. This will defuse the state of mind they are in. When it is your turn to speak, start with letting them know you agree with what they said (it is even better if you actually say, word by word, what are you agreeing with), and then approach a different view ifbit is the case(smth like a question: \"what do you think if this happens\", \" I hear you and I think I need an advice if smth goes different, what should I do?\"). But!!! Sometimes is ok if you let a period of time to cool and come back to them and just telling them you thought of what they said and then start with agreeing with their view/perspective. Afterwords bringing up other things you need to follow up with. Giving them the feeling they are important in any matter of your life is something they find peaceful and they will be in a different set of mind. \n\nIn time, yelling family members will learn that they can talk to you in a different manner. They will come to you too and  the same \"lay-back\" situation you can apply. Even if they start yelling first and you don't have that thinking time ahead, you can just agree, trying to pay attention to the message itself and not letting your voice to get too high. You can actually ask them to let you think of what they ask you or tell you and reassure them that you will give your feedback. \n\nFor you, dear OP, it will be easier to change than for them. They did not thought of change as you did. Asking them now to stop yelling is an insult and I'm sure you don't want them feel like this. They will see, little by little that you'll yell less and less and that you listen more and maybe, one day, they will change too. \n\nI can report now that my relationship with my family is yelling-free. They yell at each other sometimes, but in relationship with me, because I sticked with my plan, they stopped. And OP,  it is such a beautiful thing to have this type of conversations, even if we disagree with each other, no more yelling 🥳\n\nYou have a long way ahead of you if, you want to start this process. Think that it is possible, but allow it to get fixed in years too. It is not a \"out of nowhere\" thing. \n\nPlease remember to be kind to yourself first of all. The way you described things I do too think that they love you and not everything that they yell is meant to harm you (actually nothing is). Listen to the message, not the voice. \n\nI hope this works out for you and your loved ones :) because one day, dear redditor, you will feel as I do and I promise, it is SO WORTH IT! \n\nI wish you best of luck and a happy life! 😇✌",
        "gpt_comment": "Growing up in a household where yelling is the norm can definitely make it tough to break the cycle, but it's great that you're aware and want to change it. One thing that might help is to practice pausing before responding. When someone starts yelling, take a deep breath and count to five in your head. This can give you a moment to decide how you want to respond rather than just reacting. It might also help to have a phrase ready, like \"I want to talk about this, but not while we're yelling,\" and then step away if you need to. Over time, this can help you build the discipline to stay calm even when others aren't. It might not change your family's behavior right away, but it can help you feel more in control and less reactive. Also, consider talking to your family about how the yelling affects you when things are calm. They might not realize the impact it has. Keep at it, and remember that change takes time.",
        "claude_comment": "Breaking the yelling cycle is really challenging, especially when it's been the normal way of communicating for so long. The key is to recognize that you can only control your own responses, not anyone else's.\n\nOne effective technique is to practice the \"grey rock\" method when others start yelling. This means becoming as unreactive and uninteresting as possible - keeping your voice steady and calm, using short responses, and avoiding getting pulled into the emotional escalation. It takes practice, but it works because yelling usually feeds off the other person's reaction.\n\nWhen you feel yourself getting triggered, try taking a deep breath and counting to 5 before responding. If you need to, it's perfectly okay to say \"I need a minute\" and step away until you can respond calmly. This isn't running away - it's giving yourself space to break the pattern.\n\nFor the long term, consider learning some basic meditation or mindfulness techniques. These can help you stay centered when tensions rise. Start small, even 5 minutes a day of practicing calm can make a difference in how you handle heated moments.\n\nRemember that changing this pattern won't happen overnight. There will be times you slip up and yell back - that's normal. What matters is recognizing it, resetting, and trying again next time. Each calm response is building a new habit, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.\n\nThe fact that you're aware of this pattern and wanting to change it is already a huge step forward. Keep working at it, and don't be too hard on yourself when it's difficult.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing the pattern of behavior in your household and wanting to make a change. One thing to consider is that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. When someone yells at you, it's natural to want to yell back, but taking a step back and not engaging can be really powerful. Instead of ignoring them entirely, you could try taking a deep breath, counting to 10, or even just saying \"I'm not going to discuss this when we're both upset, let's talk about it later.\" This can help de-escalate the situation and give you time to collect your thoughts before responding. It might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your family members about how their yelling affects you, and see if you can all work together to find more constructive ways of communicating. Remember that changing your response to yelling doesn't mean you're being weak or passive, it means you're taking control of your own emotions and reactions. It's not going to be easy, but with practice and patience, you can develop new habits and learn to respond in a way that feels more positive and respectful to yourself and others.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds like a tough situation, and it's great you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to change it. It's definitely possible to break free from that cycle, even if it feels ingrained.\n\nFirst, you're right, ignoring them *might* be a strategy, but it's hard to do in the heat of the moment. Think of it like this: you're trying to rewire your brain's reaction. It's going to take practice and you'll slip up, and that's okay. Don't beat yourself up when you do yell back, just acknowledge it and try again next time.\n\nA few things you could try:\n\n*   **Pre-plan your response:** When you're calm, think about a few phrases you can use when someone starts yelling. Something neutral like \"I hear you're upset\" or \"I need a minute to process this\" can buy you time and disrupt the usual yelling match. The goal is to not engage with the content of the yelling, but acknowledge the emotion.\n*   **Remove yourself:** If possible, physically leave the situation. Say something like, \"I'm getting too heated, I need to step away for a bit.\" Go to another room, go for a walk, anything to break the cycle. This is a really powerful tool.\n*   **Focus on your breathing:** When you feel yourself getting triggered, consciously slow down your breathing. Deep breaths can help calm your nervous system and make it easier to think rationally.\n*   **Lower your voice:** This might sound counterintuitive when someone is yelling, but try lowering your voice and speaking calmly. It can be disarming and force the other person to adjust their volume too.\n\nIt's also worth considering that your dad might not even realize how his yelling impacts you. Maybe, at a calm moment (definitely not during an argument!), you could try talking to him about how it makes you feel. Frame it as \"I'm trying to communicate better, and I'd appreciate it if we could both work on not yelling.\"\n\nThis won't be an overnight fix, but with consistent effort, you can definitely change your reactions and hopefully influence the dynamic in your family. Good luck!\n"

At that point, you can do it more or less and/or add a new thing to try and do consistently. \n\nAlso stick with the things you’re already doing if you like them, or scale back on those to make more time for yourself if you feel you could better invest your time elsewhere",

This way, you’re not trying to do everything at once, and you can give each interest the attention it deserves. \n\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for each interest. Instead of aiming to become fluent in French immediately, set a goal to practice for 15 minutes a day. This makes it more manageable and less daunting. \n\nLastly, try to schedule your time.

        "claude_comment": "Your situation is really common - having lots of interests is great, but it can definitely lead to decision paralysis. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:\n\nFirst, accept that you can't do everything at once. Instead of trying to juggle all your interests simultaneously, try breaking your year into quarters and focusing deeply on just 1-2 interests per quarter. For example, Q1 could be French + music, Q2 could be online courses, etc. This way you're still pursuing everything, just not all at the same time.\n\nFor those 3-4 free hours you have, try time blocking. Set specific days for specific activities - maybe Monday/Wednesday for French, Tuesday/Thursday for music, etc. Having a schedule eliminates the daily \"what should I do?\" decision that often leads to defaulting to TV.\n\nFor the work burnout issue - consider taking a proper break right after work instead of jumping straight into activities. A 30-minute reset (meditation, quick walk, whatever works for you) can help transition your brain from work mode to personal time.\n\nRegarding the business idea - that's actually something you could start preparing for gradually. Use one of your quarterly blocks to research and plan. You don't need to quit your job immediately to start laying the groundwork.\n\nRemember that consistency beats intensity. Even 30 minutes of focused practice on something is better than an irregular schedule of longer sessions. Start small, stick to your schedule, and adjust as needed.",

First, let's give you credit for already being pretty efficient with your time - working from home, fitting in chores during the day, and prioritizing time with your dog is no small feat. \n\nOne strategy that might help is to try to group similar activities together and allocate specific times for them. For example, you could dedicate one evening a week to music practice, another to language learning, and so on. This can help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on the 80/20 rule - what are the 20% of activities that will give you 80% of the fulfillment and joy? Identify your top priorities and allocate your limited time to those first. It's not about giving up on all your other interests, but about being realistic about what you can fit in.\n\nIt might also be helpful to start small - instead of trying to launch your own company or become fluent in French overnight, break down these big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make them feel less daunting and allow you to make progress without burning out.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the TV time - everyone needs downtime, and it's okay to take a break and recharge.

Schedule it like you would a meeting.\n\nFor the startup idea, break it down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of \"start a company,\" think \"research one potential business idea for 30 minutes this week.\" Small wins build momentum.\n\nAlso, be realistic about your energy levels.

I realized that I have been sleeping A LOT ever since I started on this purge.\n\nI feel very aimless.\n\nI also tend to check my phone even more for any updates because I have turned all the notifications off. I have unfollowed all people who are constantly posting content.\n\nMy college began on 1st sept and I got work, but I don't even feel like working on it. I don't feel motivated enough to wake up to my alarm on weekends (even after enough hours of sleep).\n\nI workout almost every day, but once I am back home from the gym, I go back into this slow, dull, unmotivated life.

        "percentile_10_comment": "A common phrase I hear when it comes to social media detoxing is “It’s not enough to just remove social media from your life. You actually have to replace it with something else.” \n\nAnd that kinda makes sense. You used to get your dopamine highs from something. And now you stopped it without replacing it.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend going cold turkey though. Honestly, I think it’s better to slowly wean yourself off it while spending more and more time doing a hobby or something else you’re interested in.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, kudos for taking the big step to cut down on social media. That's not easy, and it's a great start. Feeling stuck after making such changes is pretty common, so you're not alone in this.\n\nIt sounds like you're in a bit of a transition phase, and that's okay. Here are a few things you might try to help get unstuck:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something small each day that you can accomplish. It could be as simple as reading a chapter of a book, organizing your desk, or cooking a meal. These small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and help you feel more in control. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and schedule time for activities you enjoy or want to explore.\n\n3. **Explore New Interests**: Since you've freed up some time, maybe try picking up a new hobby or skill. It could be anything from learning a new language, trying out a new sport, or even volunteering. This can add some excitement and purpose to your days.\n\n4. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on what you're grateful for or what went well. This can shift your focus from feeling aimless to recognizing progress and positivity.\n\n5. **Stay Connected**: Even if you don't have many friends, try to engage with people in your college or community. Joining clubs or study groups can be a great way to meet new people and feel more connected.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. Be patient with yourself and keep experimenting with what works for you. You've already shown discipline by cutting down on social media, so you definitely have it in you to make more positive changes. Keep going!",
        "claude_comment": "Great job on taking steps to reduce social media - that's a huge accomplishment! But you've discovered something important: removing distractions is only part of the equation. The other part is building something meaningful to fill that space.\n\nThe aimlessness you're feeling is pretty common when making big changes. Your brain is used to getting constant stimulation and dopamine hits from social media, so it's natural to feel a bit lost without them. The excessive sleeping and phone checking are your mind's way of trying to fill that void.\n\nHere's what you can do to move forward:\n\nFirst, create a simple morning routine that gives your day structure. Start with just 3 things you'll do right after waking up - maybe it's making your bed, drinking water, and reading for 10 minutes. The key is consistency, not complexity.\n\nSince you're already working out (which is awesome), use that momentum. Right after your workout when you still have some energy, pick ONE small productive task to complete. Could be reading one chapter for college, organizing your notes, or working on an assignment for 25 minutes. Just one thing.\n\nFor the weekend alarms - give yourself a reason to wake up. Plan something enjoyable for Saturday morning, even if it's just having your favorite breakfast or going for a walk somewhere nice. Make it worth getting up for.\n\nThe goal isn't to fill every moment with productivity. It's about creating enough structure and purpose that you don't feel adrift. Start small, be consistent, and gradually build from there. You've already shown you can make positive changes - now it's just about redirecting that energy into building rather than just removing.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you've taken significant steps to reduce your social media usage, and now you're facing a new challenge - finding purpose and motivation outside of it. Cutting off social media can create a void, and it's common to feel aimless or stuck. \n\nOne potential issue is that you've removed a big part of your daily routine without replacing it with something else. Since you've been sleeping a lot, it might be worth exploring other activities to fill your time, like reading, learning a new skill, or pursuing a hobby. You've already got a good workout habit going, which is excellent, so maybe try to build on that by setting small, achievable goals for after your gym sessions.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention not feeling motivated enough to work on your college tasks or wake up to your alarm on weekends. Have you considered setting clear, specific goals for what you want to accomplish in a day or week? Breaking down larger tasks into smaller ones can make them feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum.\n\nLastly, since you've mentioned your food habits haven't been great lately, maybe try to establish a healthier routine around meal times. Sometimes, small changes like eating nutritious food or having a consistent sleep schedule can have a significant impact on our energy levels and motivation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time to figure things out, and it's great that you're recognizing the need for change. Keep experimenting, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. What do you think might be a small, manageable step you could take this week to start building some momentum?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you've made some really positive first steps by cutting back on social media. It's totally normal to feel a bit lost and aimless when you remove something that used to take up a lot of your time and attention.\n\nIt seems like you're experiencing a void, and your brain is looking for something to fill it. The increased sleep and phone checking are likely symptoms of that. Instead of just cutting things *out*, try focusing on adding things *in*.\n\nSince you're already working out, that's a great foundation. Maybe you could build on that by setting some specific fitness goals, like learning a new skill at the gym or training for a fun run.\n\nFor the aimlessness, try exploring some new hobbies or revisiting old ones you enjoyed. Even small things like reading a book, learning to cook a new dish, or spending time in nature can make a difference. Think about what genuinely interests you, not just what you think you *should* be doing.\n\nRegarding your college work, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the whole project, focus on completing one small step each day. The momentum from small wins can often lead to bigger motivation.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. Building new habits and finding your direction takes time. Don't get discouraged if you slip up or have a bad day. Just keep making small, consistent efforts, and you'll eventually start to see progress. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "For the past two years, I have been sleeping, dreaming about me being a sissy and pleasuring different people I have met and am friends with. I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\n\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don’t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked. Whenever I think about being the dude in sex, I stay up all night. But the moment I think about me getting plowed by a dick, I sleep like a baby.\n\nThis thinking is severely affecting my career. Me, doing a master’s in finance, have to give a lot of presentations. Since watching sissy porn, my confidence has dropped a lot, and I am shy all the time. My manhood is being affected by this type of porn.\n\nI am unable to be the focus on my studies as well. I am so attracted to this type of porn that I have started missing my online lectures, or I watch porn during the lectures on my phone.\n\nI don’t know how to cope up with this addiction.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - this is clearly having a significant impact on your life, and it's good that you're reaching out for help. Porn addiction is a real issue that can affect many aspects of life, including sleep, focus, and self-image. \n\nThe first step is to recognize that this has become a compulsive behavior that's interfering with your studies and mental wellbeing. You'll want to break this cycle through a combination of practical changes and support.\n\nStart by installing solid website blockers on all your devices - I recommend Cold Turkey or Freedom. Block access to all porn sites and related content. Delete saved links and clear your browsing history to remove easy access points.\n\nFor the sleep issues, you'll need to establish a new bedtime routine. Put your phone in another room. Try meditation apps, reading, or listening to sleep stories instead. It may be tough at first, but your brain needs to relearn how to sleep without the current associations.\n\nFor your studies, set up your workspace in public areas like the library where you can't access inappropriate content. Use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minute breaks. This helps rebuild concentration gradually.\n\nMost importantly, you don't have to tackle this alone. Consider joining r/pornfree for community support. There are also counselors who specialize in porn addiction and can help you work through the underlying issues. Many universities offer free counseling services - take advantage of that.\n\nRemember that your worth isn't defined by this struggle. Focus on small daily improvements rather than trying to change everything at once. You've already taken the crucial first step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a pretty complex issue that's affecting multiple areas of your life. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share something like this, so kudos to you for being honest about what you're going through.\n\nTo start addressing this, I'd recommend taking a two-pronged approach: tackling the sleep issue and working on building your confidence and motivation. For sleep, you might want to try establishing a consistent bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn or erotic thoughts. This could be as simple as reading a book, meditating, or doing some light exercise before bed.\n\nRegarding the porn addiction, it might be helpful to identify triggers that lead you to watch sissy porn and find alternative ways to cope with stress or boredom. You could try replacing porn with other activities that bring you joy or help you relax, like hobbies or spending time with friends.\n\nIt's also important to address the underlying confidence issues that are affecting your studies and presentations. Consider seeking out resources on building self-confidence, such as books, TED talks, or even therapy sessions. Additionally, you might want to try practicing positive self-talk and reframing negative thoughts about yourself.\n\nLastly, since you're a master's student in finance, you might find it helpful to break down your study goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help you stay focused and motivated, even when you're struggling with distractions like porn.\n\nRemember that overcoming addiction and building discipline is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be afraid to seek out support from friends, family, or professionals if you need it. You got this, and you can spiral out of this hypnotic porn cycle with the right mindset and strategies.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out is a really positive first step. It's definitely possible to break free from this cycle.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that you're dealing with a real addiction. Like any addiction, porn use can rewire your brain and create strong cravings. Don't beat yourself up about it, but recognize it's something you need to actively address.\n\nPractical steps you can take:\n\n1.  **Blockers:** Install website blockers on your phone and computer. There are many options out there, some even let you set a password that only someone else knows, adding an extra layer of accountability.\n2.  **Replace the Habit:** When you feel the urge to watch porn, immediately do something else. This could be exercise, meditation, reading, calling a friend, or working on your studies. The key is to interrupt the thought pattern.\n3.  **Scheduled Study Time:** Treat your online lectures like in-person classes. Find a quiet place, turn off your phone (or put it in another room), and focus solely on the lecture. Break down your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks with short breaks in between. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break) can be really helpful.\n4.  **Address the Underlying Issues:** You mentioned a drop in confidence. Consider exploring why you feel this way. Journaling can be a good way to process your thoughts and feelings. If possible, talking to a therapist or counselor could provide valuable support and guidance.\n5.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn. This could include reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n6.  **Accountability:** Tell a trusted friend or family member about your struggle and ask for their support. Having someone to talk to and hold you accountable can make a big difference.\n\nIt's going to take time and effort, and you'll likely have setbacks. Don't let those setbacks derail you. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track. You've got this!\n"

I have a hard time dealing with stress, and it is heavily affecting my work life. Since elementary school, I have been very depressed and I guess my defense at that time was to give up and shut down. Now that I’m an adult that just can’t work anymore. I have trouble holding down a job because when something tough hope s, I get so stressed out and I shut down. It’s not only mental but also physical. I’ve gotten really sick when thinking about going to work or if something stressful happens at work and my Systolic BP went dangerously high. \n\nIt affects my self worth, and confidence. I have a very hard time supporting myself, and my wife struggles a lot to financially support me when I get fired or quit. I’ve been hospitalized over psychosis from breaking from stress.

Like you, I have dealt with anxiety and depression for a majority of my life. I have spent thousands of hours in therapy, tried different medications, treatment methods, all with varying results but the one constant in my life seems to be the depression and anxiety. \n\nNot unlike you, I grew up in an unstable environment, I never really felt comfortable or safe at home, school or anywhere really. I was constantly on edge, almost always in fight-or-flight mode. I constantly worried about what in my environment might hurt me and looked for ways I could find refuge or relief. I internalized all of these feelings and as I grew up I continued to deal with it on my own by withdrawing into myself and shutting down when things got overwhelming. \n\nI believe the self-doubt, insecurity, anxiety, and depression are the result of my experiences growing up and how I chose to deal with them, along with a sprinkling of genetic predisposition, of course :)\n\nFast-forward to today, not much has changed in how I deal with my experiences and feelings. That’s where the problem lies. I continue to work with a therapist and try different treatment methods, but it continues to be a long and difficult journey. Changing habits that have been engrained in your brain over many years, habits used to protect yourself (often successfully) from the outside world, is a complicated and arduous process. It is certainly doable, but it will not be easy. \n\nI have made notable progress with my mental health in the past couple of years but recently I have been struggling so forgive me for the length of this comment; writing this feels therapeutic for me. Although I do not have an exact answer for you on where to get started or how to make an immediate impact on your mental health, I can spout off a few thoughts that have helped on my journey:\n\nIf nothing else, It is important to always keep in mind that the journey to the promised land of mental well-being is not a linear progression, there will be many ups and downs. Keep going through difficulties. \n\nWhile it is important to persevere through difficult times, it is equally important to recognize when something is not working for you. Knowing when it is the right time to change course and try something new is a difficult question to answer, especially when you’re already full of self-doubt, but only you can decide to keep trying. \n\nThat said, it is immensely helpful to have someone that you can talk to and to hold you accountable, be it a therapist, partner, family member, or friend. Find someone that you can trust, to be open and honest with so that you can honestly discuss your problems and get help when you need it. \n\nStrive to be radically honest with yourself and with others. You will not change unless you are honest with yourself about what needs to change. This goes for dealing with your therapist or someone who is helping and holding you accountable: they cannot help unless you are being honest, even when it hurts. \n\nI hope this helps. I feel better for writing my thoughts out. Thank you for sharing yours.",

Building self-worth and reducing the need for external validation is a journey, but there are some steps you can take to start moving in the right direction.\n\nFirst, try to focus on small, achievable goals that can help you build confidence over time.

When you complete it, acknowledge it internally: \"I said I would do this, and I did it.\" This builds trust with yourself.\n\nFor the validation seeking, try this: Each time you accomplish one of these small goals, write it down in a journal or notes app. This creates a record of your wins that you can look back on when you're doubting yourself. Over time, this personal record becomes more meaningful than external validation.\n\nRegarding work stress, consider exploring remote work or freelancing options that let you control your environment and pace. Many people find this helps manage stress levels better than traditional workplace settings. Start small here too - maybe just an hour or two of focused work, then gradually build up your tolerance.\n\nRemember that building self-worth is like building muscle - it happens gradually through consistent small efforts, not overnight. Focus on what you can control today, and let each small win stack up over time.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share your story and acknowledge the struggles you're facing, so thank you for being honest about your experiences. It's clear that you've been through a tremendous amount of pain and trauma, and it's understandable that you're struggling with self-worth and validation seeking.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small in building your self-worth. Instead of looking for external validation, try to focus on tiny accomplishments that you can acknowledge and celebrate yourself. This could be something as simple as making your bed, taking a shower, or cooking a meal. By recognizing and appreciating these small wins, you can start to build a sense of self-efficacy and confidence.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your worth and identity aren't defined by your job or your ability to work. You are more than your productivity or career, and it's okay to take time to focus on your mental health and well-being. Have you considered exploring alternative forms of work or activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, but might not be as stressful or demanding?\n\nIn terms of validation seeking, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge negative self-talk. When you feel the urge to seek validation from others, try to pause and ask yourself what you're really looking for. Is it genuine connection and understanding, or is it a temporary fix to boost your self-esteem? By being more mindful of your motivations and needs, you can start to develop healthier relationships with others and work on building a more stable sense of self-worth.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the importance of therapy and support groups in your journey. It's great that you're already attending therapy, and it might be helpful to explore additional resources or communities that can provide you with connection and understanding. Remember that you don't have to face this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.\n\nKeep in mind that healing and growth are slow processes, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by sharing your story and seeking help, so be proud of yourself for that.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to reach out like this. It's understandable that you're feeling drained.\n\nFirst off, it's great that you're already in therapy and trying different medications. That's a solid foundation. Maybe it's worth discussing with your therapist if there are specific therapeutic techniques, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), that could help you manage stress and regulate your emotions in the moment. DBT, in particular, is often helpful for people who have difficulty managing intense emotions.\n\nRegarding the job situation, instead of aiming for \"real jobs\" right away, could you explore part-time or freelance work that allows you to gradually build your tolerance to stress? Maybe something project-based where you have more control over your workload and deadlines. This could help you build confidence and a sense of accomplishment without immediately overwhelming you. Even volunteering could be a good way to ease back into a work environment and build skills.\n\nAs for the validation seeking, that's a tough cycle to break. One thing that might help is to actively work on building your self-worth from the inside out. Start small. Maybe each day, write down one thing you appreciate about yourself, even if it feels silly at first. Focus on your strengths and accomplishments, no matter how small they seem. Another thing you can try is to set small, achievable goals for yourself each day. Completing these goals can give you a sense of accomplishment and boost your self-esteem.\n\nTo combat the loneliness, instead of focusing on making new friends right away, maybe reconnect with some of the old ones, even if it's just a quick message or a phone call. Start small and build from there. You could also explore joining groups or activities based on your interests. This can help you meet people who share your passions and build connections organically.\n\nIt's a process, and there will be setbacks, but be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help. Keep going!\n"

It might not feel like it, but it's a sign that you haven't given up yet. \n\nWhen you say you want to \"feel tame in your character\" and be worth something, it sounds like you're craving a sense of purpose and self-improvement. That's a great place to start. Instead of focusing on all the things you feel like you're not good at, try to identify one small thing that you'd like to work on or achieve. It could be as simple as reading a book, taking a short walk each day, or practicing a new skill. Having a tiny goal to work towards can help build momentum and confidence.\n\nIt's also important to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and nobody is born with all the knowledge and skills they need. Your friend might seem more mature and articulate, but that doesn't mean you can't develop those qualities too.

Even something small, like helping out at a local animal shelter or food bank, can make a difference and give you a sense of purpose. It can also get you out of your head and into the world.\n\nAs for feeling inadequate compared to your friend, remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of comparing yourself, try to learn from him. Ask him how he developed his knowledge and communication skills.

The idea is that no matter how small the thing is that you do you are moving your life forward.  This helps a lot because the biggest motivator is seeing results.\n\nWhat can go hand in hand with this is breaking down your goals into the smallest possible steps.

Here's what has worked for others in similar situations:\n\nStart ridiculously small. Like, laughably small. Want to study? Commit to reading just one paragraph. Want to exercise? Do a single push-up. The key is making the barrier to entry so low that your brain can't come up with excuses.\n\nThe \"two-minute rule\" is great for this. Tell yourself you only have to work on something for two minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll naturally want to continue. But if you don't, that's fine too - you still succeeded by doing those two minutes.\n\nFor the perfectionism piece: try treating yourself like you're learning a new video game. You're supposed to be bad at first. That's normal. You're gathering experience points. Every \"failure\" is actually just useful data about what works and what doesn't.\n\nKeep a \"done list\" instead of just a to-do list. At the end of each day, write down everything you accomplished, no matter how small. Over time, you'll see that you're making more progress than your brain wants to admit.\n\nRemember: motivation follows action, not the other way around. You don't need to feel motivated to start.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a tough mix of motivation and self-doubt issues. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your tasks into tiny, manageable chunks. This can make it feel less daunting and allow you to build momentum. For example, if you're struggling to study, start by committing to just 10-15 minutes of focused work per day. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you'll find you can keep going. Additionally, try to practice some self-compassion - remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It might also be helpful to identify what triggers your negative self-talk and see if you can challenge those thoughts with more realistic, positive ones. As for getting unstuck, sometimes taking a break and doing something completely unrelated can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective. Have you tried setting aside some time to do something you enjoy, just for fun, without any expectations or pressure to perform?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I've definitely been there. It sounds like you're in a classic overwhelm/avoidance cycle. The good news is, it's breakable!\n\nFirst, ditch the idea of needing to do *everything*. Pick *one* tiny thing. Seriously tiny. Like, \"open the document I need to work on\" tiny. Or \"read one page of the textbook.\" The goal isn't to accomplish something huge, it's to break the inertia.\n\nSecond, be kind to yourself. The negative self-talk is a killer. When you catch yourself thinking \"I'm the dumbest person,\" try to counter it with something neutral, like \"I'm learning.\" It feels silly, but it helps rewire your brain over time.\n\nThird, forget perfection. Aim for \"done,\" not \"perfect.\" Perfectionism is often just procrastination in disguise. If you're studying, try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break). It helps make the task less daunting.\n\nFinally, remember that progress isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days. Don't beat yourself up for the bad ones, just acknowledge them and try again tomorrow. You got this!\n"

      "body": "For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I'd legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I've done just that before.\n\nI realize it will ultimately come to \"just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc\" which is fine. But ideally I'd like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "Here’s the thing - it’s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that’s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here’s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

        "claude_comment": "That pull toward inaction is super common - your brain is trying to avoid what it perceives as unpleasant work. The good news is you can gradually rewire this response through a few practical approaches.\n\nFirst, try breaking tasks into ridiculously small chunks. Instead of \"clean room,\" make it \"put away one item\" or \"clear this one corner of the desk.\" Your brain has less resistance to tiny actions, and once you start, momentum often carries you further.\n\nSecond, use implementation intentions: \"When X happens, I will do Y.\" For example, \"When I finish my morning coffee, I will put away 3 items.\" This bypasses the decision-making process where resistance typically creeps in.\n\nA technique that's helped many people is the \"5-4-3-2-1\" method. Count down from 5, and when you hit 1, immediately take physical action - stand up, grab that first item, whatever gets you moving. It short-circuits the overthinking that leads to inaction.\n\nThe key isn't fighting the resistance - that just creates more mental friction. Instead, make the first step so small it feels almost silly to resist it. Over time, as you build positive associations with taking action, that pull toward inaction naturally weakens.\n\nStart with just 2 minutes of action at scheduled times. The consistency matters more than duration at first. You're essentially teaching your brain that these tasks aren't actually threatening, and the resistance will gradually fade.",
        "llama_comment": "I think what you're experiencing is pretty common, and it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to address it. One strategy that might help is to try to understand what's driving your aversion to these tasks - is it the physical effort, the mental overwhelm, or something else? Once you have a better sense of what's behind your resistance, you can start to break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces, and find ways to make it less painful. For example, instead of thinking \"I need to clean my entire room,\" try telling yourself \"I'll just put away these 5 items on my desk.\" It's a small win, but it can get you moving. Additionally, you might consider implementing a \"2-minute rule\" - when you feel the urge to procrastinate, commit to working on the task for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and you'll find you can keep going after those initial 2 minutes are up. As for eliminating the pull toward doing nothing, it's unlikely you'll be able to completely eliminate it, but by building discipline and developing strategies to overcome your resistance, you can make it easier to choose action over inaction.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is actively fighting you! Instead of trying to eliminate the feeling entirely (which is tough), maybe try to work *with* it.\n\nOne thing that helps me is breaking tasks down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of \"clean my room,\" it's \"put one sock in the hamper.\" Seriously. Just *one*. The barrier to entry is so low that it's hard to argue with. Often, once you've done that one tiny thing, you'll find it easier to do another, and another.\n\nAnother trick is to pair the unpleasant task with something you *enjoy*. Listen to your favorite podcast while you organize, or promise yourself a small treat (like a piece of chocolate or 5 minutes of browsing Reddit) after 15 minutes of cleaning.\n\nFinally, consider *why* you're avoiding the task. Is it overwhelming? Do you not know where to start? If that's the case, maybe spend a few minutes planning *before* you start. A little bit of planning can make the task seem less daunting. Good luck!\n"

I lead a healthy lifestyle where I go to gym 4-5 days a week. My life seems quite satisfactory to people around me. I feel motivated too till everything around me is going smooth, but as soon as I lack somewhere in my routine like when I oversleep in the morning and arrive late at work or when I am not able to finish my day to day tasks on time, I get these anxiety attacks where I feel I have become a failure and will not be able to do much in life. \nI feel life I am not progressing at all and this thought haunts me even more when I see people my age achieving milestones while I am here struggling to keep up with my everyday life. \n\nI feel I lack discipline. Can you suggest me something to help me cope up with this situation?",

        "best_comment": "Since I’m about 30 years older than you I would like to give you my perspective from my age. Once you get into your 40s and especially your 50s you realize that all of those milestones are not as important as they seemed in your 20s. Everybody’s life has a different path and while others may be hitting certain milestones those may not be your milestones. You’ll achieve other milestones that are important for your life. And when you reach your 40s and 50s you’ll realize that the only thing that’s really important is that you’re happy. You’ll realize that a job that you enjoy is the most important thing because living your entire career for Fridays and holidays and vacation days is a horrible way to live. And I know because I did that for 26 years. Find some thing you love that doesn’t make you dread Sunday night because you know Monday’s coming and you don’t live for days you don’t have to go to work. Find friends that are loyal and true that you can completely be yourself with, your quirky, weird side no one really gets to see. And if you’re creating a bucket list of things you’d like to do don’t wait, go do them right now. Because you don’t know what 20 or 30 years down the line in your life will look like. And I know because at 50 I became disabled. And now I cannot accomplish many of the things that were on my bucket list. I hope somehow this was helpful. But just judge your life by how you feel and not what everyone else is doing. And the things you don’t get done today, they will still be there tomorrow to finish. Be kind to yourself. And if the panic attacks continue please talk to your doctor. You don’t really realize how severe they are until you stop having them. Also try some meditation and some yoga. That probably sounds a little weird but it works and I know because I’ve tried it. And even though nobody likes to talk about it our mental health is incredibly incredibly important.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to improve. It sounds like you're already doing a lot of things right, like maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working a steady job. It's normal to feel like you're not progressing sometimes, especially when comparing yourself to others. Remember, everyone's journey is different.\n\nOne thing that might help is focusing on small, consistent habits rather than big changes. For example, if oversleeping is a problem, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. This can help regulate your sleep cycle. Also, consider breaking your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This way, you can celebrate small wins and build momentum.\n\nWhen you feel anxious about not meeting your goals, try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of seeing it as a failure, view it as a learning opportunity. Ask yourself what you can do differently next time. Lastly, practice self-compassion. You're doing your best, and that's what matters. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, you're actually doing better than you realize. Having a stable job and consistent gym routine already shows discipline - many people struggle with just those basics. But I understand that feeling of falling short, especially when small disruptions throw you off.\n\nHere's what might help: Instead of seeing discipline as all-or-nothing, try building in flexibility. Life rarely goes perfectly according to plan, and that's normal. When you oversleep or miss a deadline, treat it as a temporary setback rather than a complete failure. The most disciplined people aren't those who never slip up - they're the ones who get back on track quickly without spiraling.\n\nTry setting up some \"if-then\" contingency plans. For example: \"If I oversleep, then I'll skip the morning routine but still get to work as soon as possible.\" This gives you a clear path forward when things go wrong, rather than feeling paralyzed by imperfection.\n\nAs for comparing yourself to others - remember that social media and casual observations only show highlights, not daily struggles. Focus on competing with yourself from yesterday, not with carefully curated versions of other people's lives.\n\nConsider tracking your wins, even small ones. Write down three things you accomplished each day, no matter how minor. Over time, you'll see that you're making more progress than you realize, and it'll help buffer against those moments of self-doubt.\n\nRemember: discipline isn't about perfection - it's about consistency over time, including how you handle and bounce back from the inevitable off days.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're setting a really high bar for yourself and getting caught up in all-or-nothing thinking, where one slip-up makes you feel like a total failure. First, let's acknowledge that having a 9-7 job and going to the gym 4-5 times a week is already a huge accomplishment - it shows you have a good foundation of discipline in some areas of your life. \n\nOne strategy that might help is to focus on building \"mini-habits\" - really small, achievable goals that you can consistently hit every day, like making your bed as soon as you get up or doing one push-up as soon as you wake up. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum and confidence. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that everyone has their own pace and trajectory in life. Just because someone your age is achieving certain milestones doesn't mean you're behind or failing. It's okay to take things one step at a time and prioritize your own goals and well-being. \n\nLastly, when you do have those anxiety attacks, try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's normal to have off days. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to learn from what went wrong and make a plan to get back on track the next day. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey man, it sounds like you're already doing a lot of things right! Don't discount the healthy lifestyle and consistent work – that's a solid foundation. It's easy to fall into the comparison trap, especially with social media highlighting everyone's \"wins.\"\n\nInstead of viewing slip-ups as total failures, try reframing them as learning opportunities. Overslept? Okay, what can you tweak tonight to make tomorrow morning easier? Maybe set a second alarm, prep your clothes, or go to bed 15 minutes earlier.\n\nDiscipline isn't about perfection; it's about consistency over time. It's like compound interest – small, consistent efforts build up. Try focusing on one small habit at a time. Maybe it's just making your bed every morning, or spending 15 minutes planning your day. Once that feels automatic, add another.\n\nAlso, consider breaking down your bigger goals into smaller, more manageable steps. \"Progressing in life\" is huge and vague. What does that *actually* mean to you? Once you define it, you can create actionable steps and track your progress, which can help combat that feeling of stagnation. Good luck, you got this!\n"

        "best_comment": "Use David Burns' material: his books and/or his free online depression course at feelinggood.com \n\nThe thoughts you're thinking are called \"Automatic Negative Thoughts\". Even if you're not depressed, the same methods he teaches can be used to handle these thoughts. A lot of his methods are about handling automatic negative thoughts.\n\nYou can talk back to the thoughts:\n\n\"Thank you, brain! Thank you for sharing!\" (from a video link somebody posted on this subreddit in the last few months) while smiling and then ignoring it\n\n\"What if it doesn't?\"\n\n\"What about the 999,999 people that isn't going to happen to?\" (The what-if generating part of the brain doesn't tend to be impressed by logic, the word \"not\", or small probabilities, though; it's more into pictures, associations and emotions. So this kind of reasoning might not help much but it doesn't hurt.)\n\n\"There's a thought. OK. Right now is the time for sleeping. Tomorrow at 10AM I'll sit down with paper and pencil and work out whether there's any action to be taken on that.\" (After a few days, if you really do sit down and work things out, even if it's to write \"no action required\", your brain tends to learn to trust that and sleep.) Keep a pad of paper beside the bed to write down a couple of words as a reminder when any concerns pop up.\n\nTaking action on your concerns, for example suggesting to your father not to yell; learning not to yell yourself, etc. can help calm these thoughts down (I think -- or does it encourage them?)\n\nOften when we worry, it's our subsconscious trying to distract us from our real concerns. Think about what you're really supposed to be taking action on now -- Income tax forms? Studying for a test? etc. -- and take some action every day on those things. Then the subconscious won't need to think up worries to distract you.\n\nI find it helps to take a few minutes just before going to sleep, to meditate and clear the mind. Rather than thinking about something, by having an empty mind, it allows any deeper worries to come up and also be calmed and set aside. Otherwise, when I start to fall asleep, I stop thinking about whatever I was thinking about, and then the deeper worry steps in and wakes me up.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, you're definitely not annoying, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. It sounds like your mind is on overdrive, and that can be really tough. One thing that might help is practicing mindfulness. It’s about training your mind to focus on the present moment rather than getting lost in the \"what-ifs.\" You can start small, like dedicating just 5 minutes a day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your breath. Over time, this can help you gain more control over your thoughts.\n\nAnother thing to try is journaling. Write down your worries and then challenge them. Ask yourself how likely these scenarios are and if there's any evidence to support them. Sometimes seeing your thoughts on paper can help you realize they’re not as overwhelming as they seem in your head.\n\nLastly, consider setting boundaries for consuming news or media that triggers your anxiety. It’s okay to take a break from things that make you feel worse. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to seek professional help if you need it. You're not alone in this, and you can definitely work towards a calmer mind. Take care!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - what you're describing sounds really challenging and exhausting. The good news is there are concrete techniques you can use to regain control over these racing thoughts.\n\nFirst, start practicing mindfulness meditation. Even 5-10 minutes daily can help train your brain to recognize when it's spiraling into \"what-if\" scenarios. The Headspace or Calm apps are great for beginners. When anxious thoughts come up, acknowledge them without judgment and gently return focus to your breath.\n\nSecond, try the \"worry schedule\" technique. Set aside 15-20 minutes each day as designated worry time. When anxious thoughts pop up outside that window, write them down for later and redirect your attention to the present moment. This helps contain the worry rather than letting it spread throughout your day.\n\nThird, challenge these thoughts with evidence. When you catch yourself catastrophizing, ask \"What evidence do I have that this will actually happen? What's more likely to occur?\" Write down both the worry and a more realistic alternative.\n\nFourth, channel this mental energy into productive action. If you're worried about loved ones, set up regular check-in routines. If you're anxious about relationships, have open conversations about future goals. Converting worry into concrete steps helps reduce that feeling of helplessness.\n\nRemember that managing these thought patterns is a skill that can be developed with practice. If these techniques aren't providing enough relief after consistent effort, consider working with a cognitive behavioral therapist who can provide additional strategies tailored to your situation.\n\nStart small - even tiny improvements in managing these thoughts will compound over time into significant positive changes.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with anxiety and rumination, and it's taking a toll on your daily life. One thing that might help is to practice mindfulness and meditation - not to stop your thoughts completely, but to learn how to observe them without getting caught up in the cycle of worry. When you notice yourself starting to spiral into \"what-ifs,\" try to acknowledge the thought and then gently bring your focus back to the present moment. You can start with just a few minutes a day, using a guided meditation app or simply paying attention to your breath.\n\nAnother strategy is to set aside a specific \"worry time\" each day - say, 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night - where you allow yourself to think about all the things that are worrying you. But when that time is up, try to let go of those thoughts and focus on the present moment. This can help contain your worry and prevent it from bleeding into every other part of your day.\n\nIt's also important to challenge some of these catastrophic thoughts - for example, just because someone in a TV show broke up with their partner after 8 years, doesn't mean that will happen to you. Try to reframe some of these \"what-ifs\" in a more realistic and positive light. And when you're feeling overwhelmed, remind yourself that you've survived every difficult moment in your life so far, and you can keep doing it.\n\nLastly, consider seeking out professional help - a therapist can work with you to develop coping strategies and provide support as you work through these issues. You don't have to do this alone, and there is hope for feeling more grounded and at peace.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I really get how exhausting that constant overthinking can be. It sounds like you're stuck in a loop of anxiety, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nOne thing that might help is to start practicing mindfulness. It sounds kinda cliché, but even just a few minutes a day of focusing on your breath or your senses can help you ground yourself in the present moment instead of getting lost in \"what ifs.\" There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through it.\n\nAnother thing to try is challenging those thoughts when they pop up. When you start spiraling about your parents, ask yourself, \"Is there any real evidence that they're in danger right now?\" Often, the answer is no. You can also try writing down your worries and then listing the reasons why those things are unlikely to happen. It can help to see it all laid out logically.\n\nIt also sounds like you might benefit from setting some boundaries with your thoughts. When you notice yourself ruminating, try to consciously redirect your attention to something else – a hobby, a conversation, anything that can pull you out of the spiral. It takes practice, but it can get easier over time.\n\nFinally, and I know this is easier said than done, try to be kind to yourself. You're not a \"bitch ass\" for having anxiety; it's a real thing, and it's okay to struggle with it. If these tips don't seem to be enough, consider talking to a therapist. They can give you personalized strategies for managing your anxiety and help you break free from those thought patterns. You're not alone in this, and it's definitely possible to find some peace of mind.\n"

Often, you'll find that once you start, you'll want to keep going. Also, try to attach the new habit to an existing one. If you already have a morning coffee routine, use that time to do a quick meditation or plan your day. Consistency is key, so even small steps count. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Getting into a flow state consistently comes down to creating the right environment and triggers that signal \"it's time to work.\" Start small - pick one habit you want to build and create a clear pre-work ritual. This could be as simple as sitting at the same spot, putting on specific music, or doing 2-3 minutes of breathing exercises before starting.\n\nThe key is reducing friction. Set up your workspace the night before. Put everything you need within arm's reach. Remove distractions like your phone or browser notifications. Make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it.\n\nWhat helped me most was the \"just 5 minutes\" rule. Tell yourself you only have to work for 5 minutes. Usually once you start, momentum takes over and you'll keep going. If not, that's fine - you still built the habit. Consistency matters more than duration early on.\n\nTrack your progress with a simple habit tracker. Seeing those checkmarks build up creates a powerful motivation to maintain your streak. When you do miss a day (it happens), jump right back in the next day. Don't let one slip become a slide.\n\nRemember that flow states aren't something you force - they emerge when you've reduced mental resistance through consistent practice. Focus first on showing up daily, even if just briefly. The flow will follow naturally as the habit strengthens.",
        "llama_comment": "One technique that has helped many people develop consistent habits is to start small and focus on building a chain of successes, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. For example, if you want to develop a daily writing habit, start by committing to write for just 10-15 minutes each day, and gradually increase the time as the habit becomes more ingrained. It's also important to identify your why - what motivates you to want to develop these habits in the first place? Reminding yourself of your underlying goals and values can help you stay focused and motivated, even when the going gets tough. Additionally, tracking your progress and holding yourself accountable can be a powerful tool - consider using a habit tracker or journal to monitor your progress and reflect on what's working and what areas need improvement.",

Was it the physical challenge? The social aspect? Understanding your motivations can help you stick with activities that align with your core interests.\n\nOne practical approach is to commit to any new hobby for a set period (say, 3-6 months) before deciding whether to continue. This gives you enough time to get past the initial excitement and really experience what the activity is about. During this time, keep a simple note on your phone about what you enjoy and don't enjoy about it.\n\nIf you do decide to switch activities, try to extract the lessons and skills you've gained. Martial arts teaches discipline and body awareness that can help in football, and both build overall fitness and teamwork skills that transfer to many areas of life.\n\nRemember that having varied interests isn't necessarily bad - many successful people started by experimenting with different pursuits before finding their path.

You might consider reflecting on what specifically drew you to martial arts initially and what's causing you to lose interest now - is it the routine, the social aspect, or something else?

Instead of \"become a black belt,\" aim for \"master this specific technique\" or \"attend class consistently for another month.\" Small wins can keep you motivated.\n\nAlso, it's okay to explore!

I got out of college and went to a party school right out of high school(I had no friends in hs and I was a loser) rushed a top ranked sorority and started going out every night( I ended freshman year with a 1.0 gpa) I did better my second year but my parents caught me smoking and made me drop out of college and move home. I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.\nI got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn’t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I’ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I’m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don’t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I’ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy. I have no friends, ive gained a ton of weight and all I do is work and do hw(it’s undergrad hw idk why its so hard for me to complete) and cry. I’m going to graduate soon (maybe) and I have about 30k debt: with the expulsion and the dui, the chances of getting into a masters program or a higher paying job is slim. I have about 30k in student debt and I have no car. If I get a car and insurance it will be 900 a month just insurance, I have no support system and live with my parents who hate me. I work remote and 7 days a week so everyday I wake up to the hellacious nightmare of the same reoccurring day. I want to kill myself, I work a call center job and I’m never going to get out. I’m too old for things to change, everyone has a partner and I lost the only person who cared about me. I tried dating again and it wasn’t the same. I’ve tried making new friends but no one really likes me, I’ve been in therapy for 7 years. Nothing changes, I should end it.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey, first off, I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. But I want to remind you that it's never too late to turn things around, and you've already shown a lot of resilience by getting back into school and working hard.\n\nHere are a few steps that might help you regain some control and build a more positive routine:\n\n1. **Focus on Small Wins**: You've already made progress by passing your classes and working two jobs. Celebrate those victories, no matter how small they seem. They show your capability to change and improve.\n\n2. **Set Manageable Goals**: Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable goals. This can make your workload feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.\n\n3. **Establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily routine that includes time for self-care, even if it's just a short walk or a few minutes of meditation. Consistency can help bring some stability to your life.\n\n4. **Reach Out for Support**: It sounds like therapy hasn't been as helpful as you'd like, but don't give up on finding support. Consider looking for support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Guidance**: If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or a hotline. They can provide immediate support and help you find a path forward.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for the support you deserve.",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're 23, not 83. Your life is absolutely not over and you've already shown incredible resilience by making positive changes. Getting sober, maintaining two jobs, and pulling your grades up to As and Bs is seriously impressive. Those aren't small achievements.\n\nThe past few years have clearly been rough, but you're already doing the hard work of turning things around. Focus on what you can control right now: finishing your degree, staying sober, and maintaining your improved academic performance. These are the building blocks for everything else.\n\nAbout the job situation - call centers aren't forever. Once you graduate, you'll have more options. Your DUI and academic history don't define your entire future. Many employers care more about recent performance and what you can do for them now. Keep building a solid work history and focus on developing marketable skills in your current roles.\n\nFor the immediate financial challenges: Look into income-based repayment plans for your student loans. For transportation, consider public transit or carpooling temporarily while you build up savings. $900/month for insurance is rough - that should decrease over time with a clean driving record.\n\nMaking friends as an adult takes time and consistent effort. Consider joining some hobby-based groups or volunteering - it's easier to connect with people when you're focused on shared interests or goals rather than just trying to \"make friends.\"\n\nYou've already proven you can make positive changes when you commit to them. Keep building on that momentum. Take it one day at a time, and remember that your current situation is temporary. You're not too old for anything - you're just getting started.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've been through an incredibly tough time, and it's amazing that you're still pushing forward despite all the challenges you've faced. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and hopeless - it doesn't mean you are hopeless, though. You've already shown resilience by getting back on track with your studies, stopping drinking, and working hard to support yourself.\n\nIt might be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to tackle everything at once, focus on one thing at a time. For example, you could start by finding ways to make your daily routine more bearable, like taking short breaks during the day or finding a hobby that brings you some joy. You've also mentioned therapy, which is great - it might be worth discussing these feelings of hopelessness with your therapist to see if there are any new strategies or perspectives they can offer.\n\nRegarding your debt and job prospects, it's true that having a DUI and expulsion on your record can make things tougher, but it's not impossible to overcome. You could look into speaking with a financial advisor about managing your debt, and consider reaching out to your university's career services for help with finding job opportunities or preparing for graduate school.\n\nAs for feeling like you're too old for things to change, that's just not true. People make significant changes in their lives at all ages, and it's never too late to start building a more fulfilling life. It might be helpful to try to connect with others who have been through similar experiences - there are many online communities and support groups where you can find people who understand what you're going through.\n\nLastly, please don't give up. You've made it through some incredibly tough times already, and that's something to be proud of. If you're feeling like you're in crisis, there are resources available to help - the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or you can text the Crisis Text Line at 741741. You don't have to go through this alone.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds like a really tough journey, and it's understandable you're feeling overwhelmed. It takes serious strength to keep going after facing so many setbacks, so give yourself credit for making it this far.\n\nFirst, please know that there are resources available if you're feeling suicidal. You can call or text 988 in the US and Canada to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or dial 111 in the UK. There are people who want to help you through this.\n\nIt sounds like you're already building some discipline by working two jobs and focusing on school. That's huge! Maybe try breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of thinking about the mountain of debt or the lack of a car, focus on one small win each day. Could be finishing one homework assignment, applying for one scholarship, or even just going for a short walk. Small wins build momentum.\n\nRegarding the job situation, start exploring options even if it feels impossible right now. Update your resume, practice interview questions, and look for entry-level positions in fields that interest you, even if they seem out of reach. You might be surprised at what's available. Networking can also open doors, so try connecting with people in your field on LinkedIn or at industry events (even virtual ones).\n\nAs for the social isolation, it's tough to rebuild a support system. Maybe try joining a club or group related to your interests, even if it's online. Focus on being present and engaging in the activity, rather than putting pressure on yourself to make friends instantly.\n\nIt's also worth revisiting your therapy and discussing how to make it more effective. Maybe a different approach or therapist could provide a fresh perspective. Don't be afraid to advocate for your needs and explore different options.\n\nYou're not too old for things to change. You're only 23, and you have so much time ahead of you. Focus on building a life you're proud of, one small step at a time. You've got this.\n"

Delete all social media/doomscroll apps - only use them on a computer\n3. Download a good screen time app. I use [Present](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1644737181?pt=125390894&ct=Get%20Disciplined&mt=8) which motivates you to stay off your phone by turning it into a game, but there are countless other good ones out there.

One way to curb the phone habit is to replace it with something that still gives you that sense of connection. You could try listening to a podcast or an audiobook while you get ready. It can be a nice way to engage with the world without getting sucked into endless scrolling. Another idea is to set a specific time to check your phone, like after breakfast, so you have a clear boundary. You might also consider putting your phone in another room overnight to make it less tempting first thing in the morning. Small changes can make a big difference, so experiment and see what works best for you!",
        "claude_comment": "That desire to reconnect with the world first thing is super common - our phones are basically designed to hook us that way. Here's what's worked really well for me and others: get a simple alarm clock and charge your phone in another room overnight. This creates a physical barrier between you and the endless scroll.\n\nFor addressing that connection craving, try replacing phone time with a quick morning ritual that makes you feel good and ready for the day. Could be 5 minutes of stretching, writing in a journal, or even just making your bed while thinking about what you want to accomplish. The key is having something specific and rewarding to do instead.\n\nYou can still check your phone later - maybe set a specific time like \"after breakfast\" or \"once I'm dressed.\" This way you're in control of when you engage with the world, rather than letting notifications dictate your morning. Start small with these changes and build from there. Your morning routine will thank you!",

By doing something that brings you a similar feeling of connection or fulfillment, you might find it easier to break the habit of reaching for your phone first thing. Additionally, consider setting a specific goal for your morning routine, like enjoying a cup of coffee or tea without any screens, to help you stay focused and motivated. It might also be helpful to identify what you're typically looking for on your phone in the mornings - is it social media, news, or something else? Once you know what's driving your behavior, you can find alternative ways to meet that need later in the day.",

Just jot down a few thoughts about what you're grateful for or what you're looking forward to. It can be a way to connect with yourself. Or, if you're into it, maybe a short meditation or some stretching. Even just 5-10 minutes can make a difference.\n\nAnother idea is to prep something the night before that you're excited about for the morning. Like a really good cup of coffee or tea, or a book you're enjoying. That way, you have something else to look forward to besides your phone.\n\nAlso, consider putting your phone across the room or even in another room while you sleep.

      "body": "Where do I begin?\n\nI'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.\n\nI thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)\n\nBut even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my \"career\" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?\n\nI forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   \n\n\nYou absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   \n\n\nIt is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like \"!?!\" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   \n\n\nNow that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   \n\n\n1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   \n\n\n2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  \n\n\nCC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   \n\n\nIf you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   \n\n\n3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   \n\n\nOdds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   \n\n\n4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   \n\n\nPoint being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   \n\n\nYou say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Check out www.selfauthoring.com They offer a series of writing exercises designed by clinical psychologists aimed at helping people to clarify a long term vision for their lives. IIRC, they tested it in a few universities, and it lowered the drop out rate pretty significantly.\n\nYou might also want to check out www.understandmyself.com They offer a personality assessment in accordance with the Big 5 model of Personality Theory. It can help you understand what your innate temperament and values are, what career paths would be a good fit for it, and what aspects of your personality you might want to consciously develop. \n\nBoth are pretty cheap, evidence-based and tested.

Websites like Upwork or Fiverr can be a good start for freelance work, even if it's something simple like data entry or graphic design. You can also look into local community centers or libraries for job search resources and workshops.\n\nAs for college, it's not the only path to success. Many people find fulfilling careers through vocational training or apprenticeships, which can be more affordable and quicker to complete. Look into programs that might interest you, even if it's just a little bit, and see if they offer any financial aid or scholarships.\n\nRegarding your interests, it's okay not to have a clear passion right now. Try exploring different fields through free online courses (like Coursera or Khan Academy) to see what might catch your attention.

While the job search has been frustrating, expand your search beyond retail. Look into:\n- Restaurant work (dishwashing, bussing tables)\n- Warehouse/fulfillment centers\n- Call centers\n- Security guard positions\n- Package handling (UPS, FedEx)\n\nThese often have high turnover and frequently hire entry-level workers. Apply in person when possible and follow up on applications.\n\nRegarding college - yes, working and saving for college is absolutely possible. Many students do this. Community college is a much more affordable starting point, and you can transfer credits later.

Instead of trying to find your \"passion,\" focus on developing practical skills that can support you while you explore different paths. Learning to code, basic office skills, or a trade can provide stable income without requiring a 4-year degree upfront.\n\nFor transportation, look into whether your area has job training programs - some offer assistance with getting a driver's license. Public transportation and bicycle commuting can work in the meantime.\n\nTake things one step at a time. Your first goal is finding steady income.

Instead of worrying about having a \"good plan\" for your entire life, try focusing on what you can do in the next few weeks or months to move forward.\n\nYou've already taken a great first step by applying to jobs, even if you haven't gotten any calls back yet. Consider reaching out to local non-profits or community organizations that might offer job training programs or resume-building workshops. These can be a good way to gain some skills and experience, and you might meet people who can offer valuable advice or connections.\n\nRegarding college, it's not necessary to have it all figured out right now. You could look into online courses or certification programs that interest you, even if it's just for a few weeks. This can help you explore different areas without committing to a full degree program. And yes, working and saving up to attend college later is a totally viable option - many people take this route and do just fine.\n\nAs for finding something that holds your interest, don't worry if you don't have it all figured out at 18.

        "gemini_comment": "Okay, that's a lot to unpack, and it sounds incredibly overwhelming. First off, it's completely understandable that you feel stuck. You're 18 and facing some seriously tough circumstances. Don't beat yourself up for not having it all figured out.\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps. Forget the grand plan for now. Focus on the immediate next steps.\n\n1.  **Job Search:** Keep applying. CVS and Sprouts are good starting points. Expand your search to include places like fast food restaurants, grocery stores (stocking shelves), warehouses, or even cleaning services. These often have high turnover and are more likely to hire someone without experience. Tailor your resume to each job, highlighting any skills you *do* have, even if they seem small (e.g., \"organized household chores,\" \"helped family with computer issues\"). Even volunteering counts!\n\n2.  **Skills & Resume:** Since you're having trouble getting callbacks, consider free online courses to boost your resume. Websites like Coursera, edX, and even YouTube have tons of free courses on everything from basic computer skills to customer service. Completing even a short course shows initiative.\n\n3.  **Transportation:** This is a tough one without money. Look into public transportation options in your area. Even if it's limited, it's better than nothing. Also, see if there are any local programs that offer assistance with transportation for job seekers.\n\n4.  **College:** College is a great goal, but it doesn't have to be right now. Working and saving *does* work, but it takes time and discipline. Start small. Set a realistic savings goal each month, even if it's just $25.\n\n5.  **Interests:** The \"interest hopping\" is common at your age. Don't pressure yourself to find your \"passion\" right now. Instead, try new things without the expectation of loving them forever. Libraries often have free workshops and events. Community centers might offer affordable classes. Just explore!\n\n6.  **Dysfunctional Family:** This is the hardest part. Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel unsafe, reach out to a trusted friend, family member (if possible), or a local support organization. There are resources available to help you navigate this.\n\nThe key here is to break down these big problems into smaller, actionable steps. Focus on one thing at a time. Celebrate small victories. And remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this.\n"

Knowing all of that, I want to get out of here, but here’s a problem - I don’t have any money and my parents neither.\n\nLack of support in this tough situation really makes me feel awful. I’ve got nobody nowhere. I am on my own in this very fucked up place.\n\nSee, despite being in such a bad situation, I can’t do anything. I used to be on medication for depression (it wasn’t a clear diagnosis, but two psychiatrists said I should use the meds) and recently I stopped using them, because I’m too lazy to go to a psychiatrist once again to get a new prescription. You could say: “Oh, the reason you’re not doing anything is because you’re not on meds”, but the truth is, it was exactly the same way as before.\n\nInstead of researching new options, I’m positing here on reddit waiting for people to tell me new variants. Instead of actually doing anything meaningful, I just go do my hobbies, like music production and UI design and I still have no clue how to make money in these two spheres.\n\nI’m literally slowly causing my own demise. It’s fucking awful. But I’m just too tired. I don’t know what to do. Even the possibility of dying doesn’t make me care about it.\n\nHow can I possibly start doing something and be more disciplined? I truly want to get out of here, but I’m just tired of everything.\n\nIf you’d like to read some more about my situation, [here’s the link to it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12qev2h/iwantout_17m_russia_anywhere/)\n\nThanks for reading this.",

First off, it's important to acknowledge that taking care of your mental health is crucial, especially in such a stressful situation. If you can, try to get back on your medication or seek some form of mental health support, even if it's just talking to someone you trust.\n\nAs for building discipline, start small. Pick one thing you can do each day that moves you closer to your goal, no matter how minor it seems. It could be researching ways to make money with your skills in music production or UI design, or even just setting aside 30 minutes a day to improve those skills. Consistency is key, and small steps can lead to bigger changes over time.\n\nAlso, consider reaching out to communities or organizations that might offer support or advice for your situation. Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone can make a big difference. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and taking action, even in small ways, can help you regain some control over your situation. Stay strong.",
        "claude_comment": "Your situation is genuinely urgent, and the fact that you recognize the disconnect between the severity of your circumstances and your current actions is actually a good starting point. Let's focus on breaking through this paralysis.\n\nFirst, get back on your medication. This isn't about discipline - it's about giving yourself the basic tools you need. Make it the ONE thing you do tomorrow. Just that single task. You mentioned being too tired to care, and that's exactly what depression does - it makes everything feel impossible and pointless.\n\nFor immediate action steps: Start with 25-minute blocks using the Pomodoro technique. Your first block should be researching exactly what you need to do to leave. Just 25 minutes. You can do anything for 25 minutes. Write down everything you find. When the timer ends, take a break with your music or UI design. Then do another 25 minutes.\n\nEach day, commit to just two 25-minute blocks of focused work on your exit strategy. That's less than an hour total. Break down what you find into small, specific tasks: \"Find out visa requirements for X country\" or \"Calculate minimum costs for travel to Y.\"\n\nThe key here isn't becoming disciplined overnight - it's about doing the bare minimum needed to keep yourself safe. Think of it like this: you don't need to become a different person, you just need to do enough to get yourself out of danger. Once you're in a safer situation, you can work on longer-term discipline.\n\nStart with those 25-minute blocks today. Not tomorrow. The timer on your phone is already there. Use it right now.",
        "llama_comment": "Given your situation, it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck. First, let's break down the immediate need to address your potential conscription and the desire to leave Russia. While it's great that you have hobbies like music production and UI design, leveraging them to make money could be a starting point. You might not know how to monetize these skills yet, but there are plenty of online resources and communities dedicated to freelance work and remote jobs that could help.\n\nTo start building discipline, consider setting very small, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to researching ways to monetize your hobbies or looking into organizations that might assist with relocation due to conscription concerns. The key is to make these goals so manageable that you can't help but achieve them, which will hopefully build some momentum.\n\nIt's also important to address your mental health. While you've mentioned stopping your medication due to laziness, it might be worth reaching out to a psychiatrist again or exploring online therapy options that could offer more accessible support. Your mental well-being is crucial in navigating this challenging situation.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of community and support. Besides Reddit, there might be other forums or social media groups focused on helping individuals in similar situations. Connecting with others who understand your plight can provide valuable advice, emotional support, and potentially even leads on how to improve your circumstances.\n\nRemember, taking control of your situation is a process, and it doesn't have to happen overnight. Start small, focus on building habits that contribute to your goals, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter setbacks. You're not alone in feeling this way, and there are resources available to help you navigate both the practical and emotional aspects of your situation.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds like an incredibly tough situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. It's a lot to process.\n\nFirst, it's okay to feel tired and unmotivated right now. You're facing a huge amount of stress. Don't beat yourself up for not being at your peak performance.\n\nAs for getting started, maybe try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Instead of \"researching new options,\" aim for just spending 15 minutes looking at *one* specific thing related to getting out. Just 15 minutes. Set a timer. If you want to stop after 15, that's fine. The goal is to just get the ball rolling.\n\nSame with your hobbies. You mentioned music production and UI design. Could you dedicate just 30 minutes a day to learning one specific skill related to making money from them? Maybe watch a tutorial on freelancing for UI designers, or research platforms for selling your music. Again, small, manageable chunks.\n\nThe key is to lower the barrier to entry so much that it feels almost effortless to start. Once you're in motion, it's easier to keep going. And celebrate those small wins! Acknowledge that you spent 15 minutes researching, or 30 minutes learning a new skill. It's progress, even if it feels tiny.\n\nAlso, about the medication, even if it didn't feel like a miracle cure before, it might be worth trying to get back on it, even temporarily, just to see if it helps you get a bit more clarity and energy. It's one less thing to worry about if it does help.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way, and you're capable of more than you think. Start small, be kind to yourself, and focus on taking those tiny steps forward. Good luck.\n"

The catch is that purpose and meaning usually come *after* we start doing things, not before. It's like pushing a car - it's hardest to get moving from a standstill, but once you build momentum, it gets easier.\n\nTry this approach: Pick one small activity (like drawing for 10 minutes or learning 3 new words in your target language) and commit to doing it daily for just one week. Don't worry about having a grand reason - just treat it as an experiment. The purpose often reveals itself through the doing.\n\nFor example, you might start drawing and discover you enjoy the meditative aspect of it, or find that learning a language connects you to interesting people and cultures you hadn't considered before. Your garden might become meaningful again when you focus on growing one new plant or creating a small peaceful corner for yourself.\n\nThe key is to start small and stay consistent.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling to find intrinsic motivation for activities outside of work, which can be really tough. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on the process, rather than the end goal. For example, instead of thinking \"I want to learn a language,\" try saying \"I'm going to spend 10 minutes today looking at a language learning app and seeing what it's like.\" This can help you build momentum and find enjoyment in the activity itself, rather than just doing it for a specific reason. \n\nAlso, consider exploring why you used to enjoy gardening and what changed. Was it the sense of accomplishment, the time outdoors, or something else? Identifying what specifically brought you joy might help you find other activities that give you a similar feeling. As for drawing, you could try setting aside some time to just doodle or create without any specific goal in mind - sometimes having fun with an activity can help you discover a new purpose or passion. \n\nLastly, it might be helpful to think about what kind of person you want to be and what values you want to live by. What's important to you? Do you value creativity, self-improvement, or helping others? Aligning your activities with your core values can give you a sense of purpose and direction. Remember, it's okay to take your time figuring this out and it's normal for your interests and passions to evolve over time.",

You mentioned the garden and learning a language/drawing. Don't think about \"getting good\" right away. That's overwhelming. Think about just doing *something* small each day.\n\nFor the garden, maybe it's just weeding one small patch for 15 minutes. For the language or drawing, maybe it's just 10 minutes of Duolingo or a quick sketch. The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no.\n\nThe purpose might not magically appear, but the act of *doing* something, even something small, can often create its own momentum and a sense of accomplishment.

        "best_comment": "As someone who has struggled with this as well; first off it does get better. My best advice is to ground yourself more. When you're feeling lost you're actually casting judgment on the world and your life, you're interpretating things in a way that doesn't point forward anymore.  Don't cling too tightly to any self definition or sense of ego if you start to regain it, you're always changing.\n\nI would advise you to lead with your heart instead of your head. If you've struggled with these things for a while, coming to the very true realization that our perception of the world is fallible and learning to rely on a sense of community/interconnectedness, and an acceptance of paradoxes for this reason is important. \n\nFeeling lost/like life is meaningless is actually our rational brain's attempt at understanding the world as a constant framework. Rather than seeking a constant (which you will never find) you can move forward in a way that never demands it, but is still positive (this is how we all were as kids, where we decided we didn't know enough about how the world worked yet).

The void you're experiencing might be an opportunity to explore and discover new interests without the pressure of your younger self's expectations.\n\nInstead of focusing on finding your life's grand purpose right away, try starting small. Pick up a new hobby each month - maybe photography, rock climbing, writing, or cooking. The goal isn't to find your passion immediately, but to expand your experiences and see what naturally catches your interest.\n\nFor the money you're saving, consider allocating some of it specifically for trying new experiences. Set aside a \"discovery budget\" - maybe 10% of your savings - purely for exploring activities that might spark joy or curiosity. This gives your saving a immediate purpose while you figure out longer-term goals.\n\nRemember that finding direction is an active process, not a passive waiting game. Start volunteering, join local groups, take classes, or travel to new places. Each experience, even if it's not \"the one,\" helps you understand yourself better and narrows down what truly matters to you.\n\nYour current state of questioning and searching isn't a permanent condition - it's a transition phase that many people go through.

Sometimes, discovering these small pleasures can help you reconnect with what makes you tick and give you a sense of purpose. You might also consider setting aside some time for self-reflection, whether that's journaling, meditating, or just taking long walks. Ask yourself questions like what values are most important to you, what kind of person do you want to be, and what kind of life do you want to lead.

Think of it like experimenting. Is there a hobby you've always wanted to try? A skill you'd like to learn? A place you've wanted to visit? It doesn't have to be life-changing, just something to break the routine and see if it ignites something.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned saving, maybe think about reframing your savings goal. Instead of just saving for \"nothing,\" could you save for a specific experience, like a weekend trip, a class, or a piece of equipment for a new hobby? Having a tangible goal might make the saving feel more meaningful.\n\nFinally, don't put too much pressure on yourself to find \"the\" purpose.

When you fail at some of the todo list items, like writing your paper, try to ask yourself why. Study yourself, figure out how you could have made it gone differently? Could you have started with an outline, that slowly progressed? Could you have worked with another person? Write that as the test for tomorrow, and then try that. When that fails, keep trying. **Eventually** you'll find something that works for you. And you will relapse into another rut, what matters is not failing at a task, its showing up consistently with the process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are also therapists, coaches, doctors, etc. What I would say about medication is try to use it as a crutch with the intent of just supporting the healthy habits and getting off at some point but to each his own.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common struggle, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few strategies that might help you tackle this:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Try breaking your assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and give you a clearer path forward. For example, instead of thinking about writing an entire paper, focus on just writing the introduction or outlining your main points.\n\n2. **Set a Timer**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and make the task feel less daunting. Plus, knowing a break is coming can make it easier to start.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Establish a consistent study routine. This can help train your brain to get into \"work mode\" more easily. Try to work at the same time and place each day, and keep your workspace tidy to minimize distractions.\n\n4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself small rewards for completing tasks. This could be a treat, a short walk, or some time to relax. Positive reinforcement can make it easier to build new habits.\n\n5. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you notice yourself rationalizing procrastination, try to challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself of the benefits of starting early and how good it feels to finish without the last-minute stress.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Your situation with assignment anxiety and procrastination is really common, especially since you've been \"successful\" with last-minute work before. But that cycle of avoidance, panic, and mental health hits isn't sustainable.\n\nLet's break this down into something more manageable. Instead of trying to sit down for long stretches, start with tiny work sessions - seriously, just 10 minutes. Set a timer. The goal isn't to finish anything, just to open the file and look at it. When the timer goes off, you can take a break. This helps your brain learn that starting work isn't actually dangerous.\n\nFor the physical restlessness, try to preempt it. Before sitting down, use the bathroom, get water, adjust the temperature. Then make a deal with yourself - you'll stay in the chair until the timer goes off, no matter what. Your brain will eventually learn that these \"urgent\" needs aren't really urgent.\n\nSomething that might help with the perfectionism piece: try deliberately doing a \"rough draft\" approach. Tell yourself this first attempt is supposed to be bad. It takes the pressure off and gives you something to improve later.\n\nThe key is to stop viewing this as a willpower battle. Your brain has learned some pretty effective avoidance patterns, so we need to create new patterns that feel safe and doable. Start small, be consistent, and focus on building the habit rather than the outcome.\n\nRemember - you're clearly capable of doing good work, as shown by your grades. Now it's just about finding a way to access those capabilities without the unnecessary suffering.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty tough cycle of procrastination and self-doubt. One thing that might be helpful is to break down your assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks. This could make them feel less daunting and allow you to focus on one step at a time. Additionally, trying to create a comfortable and distraction-free workspace might help - this could be as simple as using a website blocker or finding a quiet spot to work. \n\nIt's also interesting that you mention your body finding ways to distract you from the task at hand. This might be a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the work, and taking regular breaks to stretch, move around, and refresh your mind could help mitigate this. \n\nIn terms of building motivation and discipline, it might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and reward yourself when you meet them. This could be something as simple as taking a walk or reading a chapter in a book you enjoy. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be perfect, and that everyone struggles with procrastination and self-doubt at some point. \n\nLastly, it might be helpful to reflect on why you're feeling so much fear and anxiety around your assignments. Is it the fear of failure, the pressure to perform well, or something else entirely? Understanding the root cause of your procrastination might help you address it more effectively. Remember that you've been able to complete your assignments and achieve good grades despite your struggles, so it's clear that you have the capability to succeed - it's just a matter of finding ways to work with your mind and body to make the process less painful.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That procrastination spiral sounds rough, but it's definitely something you can break out of. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety around starting, which is fueling the avoidance.\n\nInstead of trying to bulldoze through it with willpower (which clearly isn't working), maybe try some strategies to lower the initial hurdle. Could you break down your assignments into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps? Like, instead of \"write essay,\" it's \"open document\" or \"write one sentence.\" Seriously, make it so easy you almost can't say no. Once you've started, the momentum might carry you further.\n\nAlso, your environment seems to be a trigger. Try working somewhere else entirely – a library, a coffee shop, even just a different room in your house. A change of scenery can sometimes disrupt those ingrained avoidance patterns.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're clearly capable, and you've proven you can get the work done. Instead of beating yourself up for procrastinating, acknowledge the anxiety and reward yourself for even small steps forward. Maybe after writing that one sentence, you get to watch a short video or grab a snack. Positive reinforcement can be way more effective than self-criticism in the long run. Good luck, you got this!\n"

The next day no more motivation, like i couldn't be bothered and so i just give up, same goes for when i wanted to learn how to play the guitar and many more hobbies/projects. And with every project/hobby that i don't finish i just feel worse and worse about myself. Is there anyway to get out of this hellish rut?

The reality is life is mostly difficult and you will need to rely on perseverance when motivation fails you. \n\nPerhaps you can break up your goals into smaller goals to feel a sense of accomplishment. Learn three chords, learn a song, learn how to pick a song, and therefore you are a basic guitar player! \n\nAnother thing you can do to improve endurance or perseverance is to keep going for an extra 10 minutes when you feel bored/disengaged/or otherwise feel like stopping and keep increasing the times or amount of time you extend your working ‘streak’. \n\nThere is no quick fix to discipline, it is hard work, perseverance, and a sense of accomplishment with each step or goal you’ve met.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. A lot of people struggle with staying motivated, so you're definitely not alone. One thing that might help is shifting your focus from motivation to building habits. Motivation can be fleeting, but habits are more reliable. Start small—pick one thing you want to work on and set a tiny, manageable goal. For example, if it's learning guitar, commit to just 5 minutes a day. The key is consistency, not intensity. Over time, these small actions can build into a routine. Also, try to connect with a community or find a buddy who shares your interest. Having someone to share progress with can keep you accountable and make the process more enjoyable. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and it's normal to lose interest sometimes. The important thing is to keep coming back to it. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "What you're describing is super common - getting excited about something new, then losing steam after a few days. The key is understanding that motivation is unreliable, but discipline can be built.\n\nStart incredibly small. Instead of \"I'm going to learn cars,\" pick something specific like \"I'll watch one 10-minute video about basic car maintenance every day.\" The goal isn't to become an expert overnight - it's to build consistency.\n\nSet a specific time each day for your chosen activity. Maybe it's right after dinner or first thing in the morning. Stick to this time religiously, even if you only do it for 5-10 minutes. This builds a habit loop that doesn't rely on motivation.\n\nAlso, give yourself permission to suck at things. Everyone starts as a beginner. Those guitar players you admire? They all started with sore fingers and terrible chord transitions. Success isn't about maintaining constant enthusiasm - it's about showing up consistently, even when you don't feel like it.\n\nTry picking just ONE thing to focus on for the next month. Set a ridiculously achievable daily goal related to it. Track your progress in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar. After 30 days, you can decide if you want to continue or try something else - but commit to those 30 days, no matter what.\n\nRemember: you're not a fraud. You're someone who's learning how to build lasting habits, and that's a skill in itself. Start small, be consistent, and trust the process.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a common pattern of starting strong but losing momentum, which can be really frustrating and affect your self-perception. One strategy that might help is to focus on building small, consistent habits rather than relying on motivation alone. For example, instead of trying to dedicate hours to learning about cars or playing guitar, start with a manageable daily goal, like 10-15 minutes of practice or research. This can help you build a sense of progress and accomplishment, even on days when you don't feel motivated. Additionally, try to identify the specific reasons why you lose interest or get discouraged - is it because the task gets too difficult, or because you're not seeing immediate results? Once you understand your patterns, you can develop strategies to overcome them. It might also be helpful to find an accountability partner or join a community related to your interests, so you can stay engaged and motivated with support from others. Remember that developing discipline and persistence takes time, and it's okay to start small - the fact that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to change is a huge step forward, so don't be too hard on yourself.",

Like, instead of \"learn to work on cars,\" maybe it's \"watch one 10-minute YouTube video about car engines\" or \"identify 5 basic tools used for car repair.\" Seriously, make them ridiculously small. The point is to build momentum and get some quick wins.\n\nAlso, try to schedule these small tasks. Put them in your calendar like appointments. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day. Consistency is key, even if it's just a little bit at a time.\n\nFinally, and this is important, try to focus on the process, not the outcome. Enjoy the act of learning, even if you don't become a master mechanic or guitar virtuoso. The goal isn't necessarily to become an expert, but to enjoy the journey and build that habit of sticking with things. Good luck, you got this!\n"

For example, if you want to get out of bed earlier, set an alarm and commit to getting up as soon as it goes off. Reward yourself for sticking to it, even if it’s just a small treat or a few minutes of something you enjoy.\n\nAlso, try setting a specific time for your goals after 3 PM.

        "claude_comment": "Reading theory is great for understanding, but it won't create change on its own - you need to start taking small actions. The gap between 3 PM and 11 PM is prime time that you could use differently.\n\nHere's what I suggest: Start by picking just ONE thing you want to do after work. Make it small and specific - not \"work on my goals\" but something concrete like \"write for 30 minutes\" or \"practice guitar for 20 minutes.\" Then, set an alarm for 3:30 PM. When it goes off, immediately do that one thing before touching YouTube/Reddit/Twitter.\n\nThe key is making it small enough that it feels doable. You don't need motivation or inspiration - you just need to do that one tiny thing consistently. Once you build momentum with one small win, you can gradually expand.\n\nAs for the nihilism - action is actually the antidote. Theory and endless scrolling keep you in your head, while doing real things (even small ones) connects you to meaning through experience rather than just ideas.\n\nDon't try to overhaul everything at once.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling to bridge the gap between knowing what you should be doing and actually taking action. This is really common, especially when you feel unfulfilled in your daily work. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're aware of your patterns and willing to change them. \n\nOne potential strategy could be to start small - instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, try committing to just 30 minutes of focused time on your goals after you're done with your day job. This could be as simple as journaling, reading something related to your goals, or doing some light planning. The key is to build momentum and make progress feel achievable.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore why you feel so disconnected from your current work - is it the type of work itself, the work environment, or something else? Sometimes, making small changes to our daily routines or finding ways to make our work more meaningful can help us feel more energized and motivated.\n\nAs for the nihilism, it's possible that feeling unconnected to your goals and values might be contributing to that sense of emptiness. By taking small steps towards your goals and exploring what truly matters to you, you may start to feel more purposeful and directed. Remember, discipline is about progress, not perfection - it's okay to take things one step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, so you're stuck in the theory trap. You've got the knowledge, but the execution is missing. That's super common, don't beat yourself up too much.\n\nHere's the thing: knowing *why* to do something is different from *actually* doing it. You're basically fighting your brain's reward system. YouTube and Reddit are easy dopamine hits, while your goals require effort and delayed gratification.\n\nFirst, tackle the morning. Even Goggins probably snoozes sometimes. Try this: put your phone across the room. Set an alarm for, say, 30 minutes *later* than you usually get up. When it goes off, you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off. Then, immediately do something small and productive. Make your bed, drink a glass of water, do 5 pushups. Anything to break the cycle of staying in bed.\n\nSecond, the 3 PM to 11 PM window. That's your prime time, and you're wasting it. Instead of trying to eliminate YouTube cold turkey (which rarely works), try this: schedule it. Seriously. Tell yourself, \"Okay, from 3 PM to 3:30 PM, I can watch YouTube.\" Set a timer. When the timer goes off, you *have* to switch to working on your goals for at least an hour. Then, you can schedule another YouTube break later. It's about controlling the habit, not eliminating it entirely.\n\nFinally, the nihilism. That's a bigger issue, but even if you think nothing matters, *you* still matter. You're still experiencing life. So, why not try to make that experience a little better? Focus on small, achievable goals. Celebrate small wins. Maybe the meaning will come later, or maybe it won't. But either way, you'll be a little less stuck. Good luck!\n"

That awareness is crucial.\n\nThe key here isn't going cold turkey (which clearly hasn't worked), but rather gradually replacing these apps with more meaningful activities. Start small - pick ONE thing you want to learn or goal you want to achieve, and commit to just 30 minutes after work before allowing yourself YouTube time. Make it something enjoyable that you actually want to do, not just something you think you should do.\n\nA technique that's helped many people is the \"activity transition\" approach. When you get home from work, instead of immediately grabbing your phone, do something physical first - even if it's just changing clothes, having a shower, or making tea. This creates a mental break between work and free time, making it easier to choose a different activity.\n\nFor the YouTube habit specifically - try setting up \"speed bumps\" rather than complete blocks. Keep YouTube, but make it slightly harder to access: log out each time, remove it from your home screen, or only allow yourself to watch it in a specific spot in your house. The goal is to make it just inconvenient enough that you have to consciously choose to watch rather than doing it automatically.\n\nRemember that boredom and discomfort are normal parts of breaking any habit. Instead of seeing them as signals to go back to YouTube, try to sit with them for just 5 minutes. Often they'll pass, and you'll find yourself able to focus on something else.\n\nYou've got this.

Finding alternative ways to manage these emotions, such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits, could help reduce your reliance on these apps.\n\nTo start making changes, you might want to try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like dedicating 30 minutes each day to a new activity or hobby.

The key is to find healthier replacements, not just cut them off cold turkey, because that's why you keep relapsing.\n\nInstead of uninstalling completely, try setting really strict time limits using built-in phone features or apps.

      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "All the above is good advice. However, try to do one thing at a time. I had pretty bad relationship with food when I first ventured out on my own. I skipped breakfast and was so tired that would eat ramen, sandwich or takeout for dinner. I can cook very well but it can be hard to cook all the time and my perfectionist tendencies made me procrastinate. So, I started with one small thing. Eating bfast. A banana with coffee and then something else later on. Now, I am onto meal prepping parts of the dishes as I do complete meals with salad + entree. They make me excited to sit down and eat mindfully. So, I make it easy to put together dinner. I have 5-6 options for bfast and I keep them all very simple. I do still sometimes skip lunches and wish if a tablet could replace food. However, I am happy where I am and just going up from here. All the best to you.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I've been working to change my relationship with food starting by identifying what triggers me into emotional eating. Then I worked on my relationship with my body, where previously I hated myself and didn't care if binge eating hurt me, or that the things I was feeding myself had painful reactions. So I started making notes of symptoms after eating certain foods. Like pizza. It was my huge emotional food, but it would make me incredibly sick. So I tested out food intolerances, a week without gluten, a week without dairy, until I figured out what my body LIKES. Now I take a pill for lactose intolerance and a gluten enzyme, and use portion control, and haven't been sick anymore.",
        "gpt_comment": "Resetting your relationship with food is a great goal, and it's awesome that you're taking steps to address it. Start by identifying your triggers for emotional eating. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know what sets it off, you can work on finding healthier coping mechanisms, like going for a walk, journaling, or talking to a friend. Planning your meals can also help. Try to include a variety of foods that you enjoy and that nourish your body. This can make you feel more in control and less likely to reach for comfort foods impulsively. Remember, it's okay to have treats now and then—balance is key. Lastly, be kind to yourself. Building a healthy relationship with food takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Here's what helped me reset my relationship with food - start by keeping a food journal for a week, but not to count calories. Instead, write down what you eat and how you feel before, during, and after. This helps identify your emotional eating triggers and patterns.\n\nOnce you spot those patterns, work on building new responses to those triggers. When you feel the urge to emotional eat, try taking a 10-minute walk, doing some quick stretches, or calling a friend. The key is having specific alternatives ready to go.\n\nFor the physical side, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting. Stock up on easy-to-grab healthy snacks you actually enjoy. Make sure you're eating regular meals - hunger makes emotional eating much harder to resist. Start small by adding one piece of fruit or veggie to each meal.\n\nThe guilt cycle you mentioned can make things worse. Remember that changing your relationship with food is a gradual process. If you have a moment of emotional eating, acknowledge it without judgment and move forward with your next meal. Each meal is a fresh start.\n\nConsider working with a registered dietitian if possible - they can create a personalized plan that takes your specific triggers and health needs into account. The goal isn't perfection, it's progress toward a healthier relationship with food.",
        "llama_comment": "Resetting your relationship with food can be challenging, but it's definitely possible with a gradual and mindful approach. A good starting point could be to identify your emotional triggers for eating - is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you're aware of these triggers, you can begin to find alternative coping mechanisms, such as going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Additionally, consider seeking help from a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can guide you on developing a balanced eating plan that suits your needs and preferences. It might also be helpful to start keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and emotions, which can provide valuable insights into your relationship with food. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection - focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes rather than trying to overhaul your entire diet at once. You got this, and taking that first step towards a healthier relationship with food is already a huge accomplishment.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it's tough dealing with emotional eating, but it's definitely something you can work on! A good first step is to start tracking what you're eating and, more importantly, *when* and *why* you're eating. Just a simple food diary can reveal patterns you might not be aware of.\n\nNext, try to identify your triggers. What situations or feelings lead you to emotional eating? Once you know what they are, you can start brainstorming alternative coping mechanisms. Instead of reaching for food when you're stressed, maybe try going for a walk, listening to music, or calling a friend.\n\nDon't try to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Small, sustainable changes are key. Maybe start by swapping out one unhealthy snack a day for something healthier, like fruit or vegetables. And be kind to yourself! It's okay to slip up sometimes. The important thing is to learn from it and keep moving forward. If you're really struggling, consider talking to a therapist or registered dietitian – they can provide personalized support and guidance. You got this!\n"

Like if you can, find some way to access a sleep specialist, spend some money on it if you can, really try to get a decent sleep schedule. Try everything you can, this matters a lot. \n\nSleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won't magically fix everything, but I feel like it's a good first step.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\n\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels—there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\n\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\n\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\n\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It’s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\n\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many successful people deal with similar challenges behind closed doors. The good news is you've already taken two huge steps: getting diagnosed with ADHD and recognizing these issues need addressing.\n\nLet's start small. When everything feels overwhelming, trying to fix everything at once usually backfires. Pick ONE thing to focus on first - I'd suggest your sleep schedule since that affects everything else. Start by setting a firm \"screens off\" time 1-2 hours before your target bedtime. Even if you can't sleep, just lie there in the dark. Your body needs to relearn proper sleep patterns.\n\nFor the immediate term, tackle your bedroom. A chaotic environment makes everything harder, especially with ADHD. Set a timer for just 20 minutes and clean what you can. Tomorrow, another 20 minutes. Don't try to perfect it - just make it livable.\n\nRegarding your law degree - you're so close. Instead of thinking about the whole six months, break it into tiny chunks. Study for just 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), then take a break. Even one Pomodoro per day is better than nothing. Build from there.\n\nFor work and motivation - external accountability helps tremendously with ADHD. Could you find a study buddy for law school? Or ask your boss for more frequent check-ins on projects? Sometimes just having to report progress to someone else can provide that extra push.\n\nKeep working with your doctor on the ADHD meds. Finding the right medication and dosage often takes time and experimentation. While you're figuring that out, focus on building small, sustainable habits rather than relying on motivation.\n\nYou haven't fooled anyone - imposter syndrome is real, but the fact that others see you as competent suggests you're more capable than you give yourself credit for. Take it one day at a time, one small win at a time. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of challenges that are all interconnected, which can be really overwhelming. One thing that might help is to focus on building small habits and routines that can help you gain momentum and confidence. For example, instead of trying to tackle your entire law degree at once, try setting a goal to study for just 15-20 minutes each day. That way, you can build up your endurance and make progress without feeling overwhelmed. \n\nSimilarly, with your energy levels and sleep issues, it might be helpful to establish a consistent bedtime routine and try to create a relaxing sleep environment. And with your motivation and productivity, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can help make them feel less daunting.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in feeling like you're \"fooling\" people or that you don't understand things as well as you think you should. A lot of people struggle with imposter syndrome, and it's okay to ask for help and admit when you don't know something.\n\nIn terms of getting your apartment and finances organized, it might be helpful to start with small steps, like setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to tidy up or work on a budget. And don't be afraid to reach out to a financial advisor or therapist for support - they can provide you with personalized guidance and help you develop strategies to manage your debt and anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to have everything figured out right now, and it's great that you're taking the first step by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep in mind that building discipline and changing habits takes time, so be patient with yourself and try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, so you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's totally understandable given everything you've listed. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Let's break this down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, tackle the physical stuff. Your health and environment are foundational. Since you're already eating healthy but not losing weight, maybe get a check-up with your doctor to rule out any underlying issues, especially given the fatigue and sleep problems. Addressing the sleep is crucial. Try setting a strict bedtime routine – even if you don't fall asleep right away, dim the lights, avoid screens, and try some relaxation techniques. Consistency is key here. As for the apartment, don't try to clean everything at once. Pick *one* small area, like your bedside table, and focus only on that. Once that's done, move on to the next small area. Small wins build momentum.\n\nNext, let's look at the law degree. Six months is a relatively short time. Can you break down your remaining coursework into tiny, achievable tasks? Instead of \"study law,\" think \"read one page of my textbook\" or \"review my notes for 15 minutes.\" Set a timer and commit to just that small amount of time. You might find that once you get started, you can keep going. If not, that's okay too. You still accomplished something.\n\nFor the job, talk to your manager. Explain that you're working on improving your time management and ask for specific feedback on deadlines. Sometimes just having a clear understanding of expectations can reduce anxiety.\n\nFinally, regarding feeling \"dumb,\" remember that everyone has imposter syndrome sometimes. Focus on your strengths and what you *do* know. Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to where you were yesterday.\n\nThe key here is to start small, be consistent, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it seems. You've got this.\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Creating a balanced schedule when you have so many interests can be tricky, especially with the challenge of hyperfocus. Here’s a strategy that might help: \n\nStart by prioritizing your interests and goals. Since you want to learn Spanish, read, and go to the gym regularly, try setting specific days for each. For example, you could dedicate certain weekdays to the gym and Spanish practice, and reserve reading for evenings or weekends. \n\nConsider using time blocks to manage your activities. After work, set a timer for 30-45 minutes for one activity, then switch to another. This can help prevent hyperfocus on one thing. \n\nAlso, try to integrate your hobbies into your daily routine. Listen to Spanish podcasts during your commute or while cooking. This way, you’re learning without needing extra time. \n\nRemember, it’s okay to adjust your schedule as you go. The key is to start small and gradually build a routine that feels natural. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there! Your situation really resonates with me, especially the hyper-focusing part. Having multiple interests is awesome, but it can definitely be tricky to balance them all.\n\nLet's break this down into something manageable. Since you work full-time and get tired after work (totally normal!), let's create a sustainable schedule that doesn't burn you out.\n\nFirst, try time-blocking your weekdays. After work, give yourself 30-60 minutes to decompress - this isn't wasted time, it's necessary recharge time. Then dedicate specific weekdays to specific activities. For example:\n\nMonday: Spanish (45 mins)\nTuesday: Gym\nWednesday: Reading (30-60 mins)\nThursday: Gym\nFriday: Spanish or Reading (whichever you feel like)\nWeekend: Hiking, socializing, and one gym session\n\nThe key here isn't perfection - it's consistency and flexibility. When you feel the urge to hyper-focus on one activity, channel that energy into your designated time slot. If you really want to do Spanish on a reading day, that's fine! Just try to get back to your routine the next day.\n\nFor Spanish and reading, shorter, consistent sessions are better than long, sporadic ones. Try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. This works great for ADHD-like tendencies.\n\nStart with this for two weeks. Don't try to be perfect - aim for 70% adherence. That's enough to build momentum while being realistic. You can adjust the schedule based on what works and what doesn't.\n\nRemember: progress isn't linear. Some weeks you'll crush it, others you won't. That's completely normal. The goal is to keep showing up, even if it's just for 15 minutes.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a common challenge of having multiple interests and struggling to balance them with your work and daily life. Given your borderline ADHD, it's great that you're aware of your tendency to hyper-focus on one thing at a time. To create a structure that works for you, I'd suggest starting small and building habits incrementally. \n\nConsider allocating specific days or timeslots for each activity, taking into account your energy levels after work. For example, you could dedicate Monday and Wednesday evenings to Spanish learning, Tuesday and Thursday evenings to gym sessions, and Friday evenings to relaxation or a low-key hobby like listening to music or podcasts. \n\nSince you mentioned getting really tired after work, it might be helpful to schedule activities that require less energy or can be done in shorter intervals, such as reading or language learning, during your weekdays. You could try breaking these activities into smaller chunks, like 20-30 minutes a day, to make them more manageable.\n\nOn weekends, you can prioritize hiking and socializing, and maybe even squeeze in some longer reading sessions or Spanish practice if you feel up to it. It's also essential to leave some buffer time for spontaneity and flexibility, so you don't feel overwhelmed by your schedule.\n\nAs for the Atomic Habits approach not sticking, you might want to revisit the concept of \"habit stacking\" – where you build new habits onto existing ones. For instance, you could try listening to Spanish podcasts or audiobooks during your daily commute or while doing chores, effectively combining two activities into one timeslot.\n\nLastly, be patient and kind to yourself as you experiment with different structures. It may take some trial and error to find a rhythm that works for you, but with persistence and self-compassion, you can develop a routine that accommodates your diverse interests and energy levels.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get the struggle – so many interests, so little time (and energy after work!). It sounds like you're dealing with a classic case of hyperfocus, which can make consistency a real challenge.\n\nInstead of trying to overhaul your entire week at once, maybe start super small. Like, *really* small. Think \"atomic habits\" but even tinier. For example, instead of \"gym 3-4 times a week,\" aim for \"put on gym clothes after work on Monday and Wednesday.\" That's it. If you end up going to the gym, great! If not, you still accomplished the habit. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry so much that it's almost impossible *not* to do it.\n\nFor Spanish, could you commit to just 15 minutes a day using Duolingo or listening to a podcast while you commute? For reading, maybe read just one page before bed. The key is consistency over intensity, especially with ADHD.\n\nAlso, consider time blocking, but with a twist. Instead of rigidly scheduling everything, create \"theme days.\" For example, Monday could be \"Movement Monday\" (gym or a hike), Tuesday could be \"Tune-In Tuesday\" (music/podcasts), Wednesday \"Words Wednesday\" (Spanish/reading), and so on. This gives you a general direction without feeling too restrictive.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself! It's okay to miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress. Good luck!\n"

They might have some suggestions for managing them, or be able to rule out any underlying medical issues.\n\nFinally, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

You could try to make it a goal to sit down at your desk and open your book/computer that day, even if you don’t write anything down, that’s part of the habit you’re creating. For exercise - put on your sneakers and maybe tell yourself you only need to walk outside for five minutes. Usually once you’re there starting then you’ll feel like it, and putting less pressure on yourself helps.\n\nDo you have any one you can meet up with to study with? Any book clubs you can join online to motivate you to read to not fall behind?\n\nAnother thing with exercise is finding something you actually like doing, not an exercise for the sake of it.\n\nYou’re not alone, I often feel the exact same way when I’m having a low energy few days, but I’m slowly finding things that work for me.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Start with one thing and start small. Maybe start with studying. Once you have a strong studying habit, add exercise. The once you've developed that, add reading. But don't rush. It'll take time (at least 21 days, if not more) to develop each one.",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to stick to a rigid routine, which can be overwhelming. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick one habit you want to build and focus on that. Make it as easy as possible to start with, like just 5 minutes of exercise or reading a page a day. Once that feels natural, gradually increase the time. Also, try to connect your habits to something you enjoy or find rewarding. This can help make the process feel less like a chore. Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Progress isn't always linear, and taking small steps consistently can lead to big changes over time. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small wins!",
        "claude_comment": "It sounds like you might be taking on too much at once and creating routines that feel restrictive rather than sustainable. Instead of trying to overhaul everything simultaneously, try picking just one small habit to focus on for now - something so easy you almost can't fail at it. Maybe that's reading for 5 minutes, or doing 2 pushups, or studying for 10 minutes.\n\nThe key is to make it ridiculously achievable. When you consistently hit these tiny goals, you'll start building confidence and momentum. Then you can gradually increase the duration or difficulty as it starts feeling natural.\n\nAnother approach that might help break the cycle: give yourself permission to be inconsistent. Rather than viewing habits as all-or-nothing commitments that you have to maintain perfectly, treat them more like experiments. If you miss a day or even a week, just pick back up where you left off without beating yourself up about it.\n\nRemember that building lasting habits is more like slowly turning a ship than flipping a switch. Small, consistent actions over time will get you much further than intense bursts followed by burnout. Start smaller than you think you need to, celebrate the tiny wins, and be patient with the process.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern of burnout from trying to stick to overly ambitious routines. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits incrementally, rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine at once. Instead of setting a goal to exercise every day, for example, try starting with just 2-3 times a week and see how that feels. You can always add more days or intensity later. \n\nAlso, consider prioritizing flexibility and self-care in your routine. It's great that you're recognizing the signs of burnout and depressive episodes, so make sure to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and adjust your goals as needed - it doesn't mean you've failed, it just means you're learning and adapting.\n\nAnother approach could be to focus on the underlying reasons why you want to build these habits, rather than just the habits themselves. What is it about exercising, reading, or studying that's truly important to you? Is it to feel more confident, to learn new things, or to improve your mental health? Connecting with your \"why\" can help make the process feel more meaningful and sustainable. \n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory along the way, even if it feels insignificant. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and seeking advice, so that's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, and try to be patient with yourself as you figure out what works best for you.",

Also, don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches. If you hate running, don't force yourself to run! Find an exercise you actually enjoy.

      "body": "I know this comes across harsh. I know that my family did the best they could with what they had. I don’t hold any resentment.\n\nHaving said this, I’m now becoming very aware of the influence they had on me. I come from a very low income family (multi generational poverty) and I am struggling to break through the conditioning. I see others in my family succumbing to it, and it’s scary. My favorite cousin is looking at serious prison time through a series of completely preventable situations because he’s not aware of how influenced he is. \n\nIn my early 20’s if I hated a job, I would just quit. I was taught that “others” are the problem. I thought this was completely normal. I was discouraged from attending college. When I attended anyway and wasn’t doing well (had a toddler and was a single mom) I was encouraged to quit and “be a mom” instead. I was told college is for rich white kids and I was already too smart to need it. I listened. \n\nGrowing up, I never witnessed anyone succeed at anything. My family was chronically homeless, in debt, and with gambling issues. I’m not just talking about my parents either. We moved around constantly due to evictions. My parents moved from job to job. They never had goals, were never financially secure, and in some cases dissuaded me from auditioning for things or joining teams at school because they didn’t want the additional expense. \n\nI was wildly naturally talented with zero support. I moved in with a friend in high school because my parents moved to another city and I loved the teams I was on and didn’t want to quit. Her family had money and I’m so grateful they helped support me.\n\nFast forward to my 30s. I have a good career, a loving partner, and my son has done well. Yet I cannot shake the urge to flee when things get difficult. I never realized it was unusual until now. I’m just now learning in my 30’s that the magic is in the day to day and I’ve totally sabotaged all of the success I deserve and worked so hard for by quitting too soon.\n\nEven knowing this, I’m struggling in my pattern. I feel like I’m cycling. I’ll be doing well, something will knock me a little off course, and I completely shut down and am ready to give up. I hate that I’m like this. It means I’ll never reap the rewards of my monumental but unfocused efforts. I have definitely put so, SO much effort in. \n\nHas anyone dealt with fighting against weak conditioning like this?

And in doing so you're setting an incredible example for your family.

        "claude_comment": "First off, you've already shown incredible resilience by recognizing these patterns and breaking away from them enough to build a good career and provide stability for your son. That's huge.\n\nThe \"flee when things get difficult\" response is essentially a learned survival mechanism. You can absolutely rewire it, but it takes conscious effort and small wins to build up that new neural pathway. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:\n\nStart tracking your \"quit impulses\" in a notebook. When you feel that urge to give up, write down what triggered it and rate the intensity from 1-10. This helps you spot patterns and takes some of the power away from that immediate emotional response.\n\nThen pick something small but challenging - could be a 30-day exercise commitment, a short online course, or a work project. The key is to choose something where failure won't have major consequences. When you feel like quitting (and you will), acknowledge the feeling but stay put for just 5 more minutes. Then another 5. Build up your \"discomfort tolerance\" gradually.\n\nThe real game-changer is redefining what success looks like. Instead of seeing it as this big end goal, celebrate staying in the game when it gets tough. Those moments when you want to quit but don't? That's where the actual growth happens.\n\nYou might also benefit from finding a \"stability mentor\" - someone who's good at staying the course through challenges. Watch how they handle setbacks. What's their thought process? Sometimes just seeing a different approach in action can help rewire our own responses.\n\nRemember, you're not fighting against your nature - you're building new capabilities. Every time you push through that quit impulse, you're literally creating new neural pathways. It gets easier with practice, but you have to give yourself time to develop this new skill.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change the patterns that have been ingrained in you, especially when they're rooted in your upbringing. Recognizing the urge to flee when things get difficult is a huge step, and it's great that you're aware of it now. One thing that might help is to start small - when you feel like quitting or shutting down, try to push through just a little bit longer. Set tiny, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate when you reach them. This can help build confidence and reinforce the idea that you can persevere through challenges.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can work with you to identify and challenge these negative patterns. They can also provide you with additional tools and strategies to help you stay on track. Additionally, surrounding yourself with positive influences and supportive people can make a big difference. It sounds like your friend's family was a great source of support for you in high school - try to find people like that in your life now who can encourage and motivate you.\n\nLastly, be patient with yourself. Changing deeply ingrained habits and thought patterns takes time, effort, and perseverance. Don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up - instead, learn from your mistakes and use them as opportunities to grow. You've already come so far and achieved a lot, and it's clear that you're capable of more. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.",

Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one area where you tend to quit and set a ridiculously small, achievable goal.

The point isn't to get a ton done in those 15 minutes, but to build the habit of showing up even when you don't feel like it.\n\nAnother thing that could be useful is to identify your triggers. What are the specific situations or feelings that make you want to quit? Once you know your triggers, you can develop strategies for coping with them. Maybe it's having a pre-planned pep talk ready, or reaching out to your partner for support.\n\nAlso, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Acknowledge that you're breaking a cycle and that takes serious strength. Be kind to yourself when you slip up – it's part of the process. Just get back on track as soon as you can.

        "best_comment": "I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.\n\nIn my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

Commit to working on something for just 5 minutes. After that, you can stop if you want to. What usually happens is that once you start, you'll often want to continue since the hardest part - getting started - is over.\n\nAnother technique is to reframe the task. Instead of seeing it as something you need to do perfectly, view it as an experiment or practice run. You're not committing to a final product, you're just exploring and learning. This takes some pressure off.\n\nRemember that doing something imperfectly is infinitely better than doing nothing at all. Every attempt, even if it doesn't turn out great, teaches you something and builds your confidence for next time.\n\nTry setting up a reward system for starting tasks early. Maybe after working on an assignment ahead of schedule, you get to do something you enjoy.

The good news is there are proven ways to manage this!\n\nFirst, try keeping your hands busy. Get a fidget toy, stress ball, or silly putty to occupy your hands while reading/gaming. Some people find success with wearing thin cotton gloves when alone, making it physically harder to scratch.\n\nFor immediate help, keep your nails trimmed very short and file them smooth. Put bandaids on spots you frequently scratch to create a physical barrier. You can also try putting Vaseline on vulnerable areas - it makes scratching less satisfying and helps healing.\n\nThe key is replacing the scratching with a different habit. When you catch yourself about to scratch, immediately do your replacement activity instead. It could be squeezing a stress ball, doing a quick hand exercise, or even just clasping your hands together. Be patient - it takes time for new habits to stick.\n\nConsider talking to your doctor or school counselor about this. They can connect you with resources and strategies specifically for managing excoriation.

This can help you identify triggers.\n*   **Replacement behaviors:** When you catch yourself scratching, immediately replace it with something else. Fidget toys, stress balls, or even just making a fist can give your hands something to do.\n*   **Barriers:** Since you're scratching your face, maybe try wearing soft gloves while you're reading, gaming, or writing. It'll make it harder to scratch without noticing.\n*   **Positive reinforcement:** Reward yourself for days you don't scratch. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something you enjoy.\n*   **Professional help:** This is a tough one to tackle alone. Talking to a therapist or counselor could give you tools and strategies tailored to your specific situation. Many schools have counselors available, and there are also online options.\n\nIt's going to take time and effort, and you'll probably slip up sometimes. Don't get discouraged! Just keep trying, and remember that you're not alone in this. Be patient and kind to yourself. You got this.\n"

I have about 30 hours worth of work to do over the course of those 3 weeks whenever I want. This is a HORRIBLE system for a procrastinator.\n\nI literally do nothing for 2.5 weeks. I ride bikes/train 15 hours a week, I play video games, I play chess, I watch youtube, I watch netflix. Anything except work. The dread of the deadline is always hanging over me. I hate the office work so much and it brings on an incredible amount stress when I'm trying to complete a 30 hour report in 2 days.\n\nI travel 25% for this job and travel weeks are 40 to 60 hour work weeks. I find that to be so much more satisfying and less stressful. The travel is one of the few reasons I haven't left yet. It's crazy that I enjoy working 60 hours a week, living out of a hotel, more than working 10 hours a week from home.\n\nI wake up everyday and I have an easy list of work things I want to complete that day. Every night I go to bed completing none of it and the stress continues to build for the next day. Then miraculously when I know I have no more time, I find the energy to work two 15 hour work days in a row. I seriously need help. I can't live like this anymore.",

I knew I was burnt out and feeling isolated, and I knew that it was affecting my work ethic as well as my mental health.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help you manage your time better and reduce that last-minute stress:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Try breaking your 30-hour workload into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the entire report, focus on completing a small section each day. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\n2. **Set a Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes dedicated work hours. Even if it's just a couple of hours each day, having a set time to focus on work can help you build a habit and reduce procrastination.\n\n3. **Use Timers**: Consider using the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make the work feel less daunting.\n\n4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself small rewards for completing tasks. It could be as simple as a coffee break or a quick game. This can help motivate you to get started and keep going.\n\n5. **Reflect on Travel Weeks**: Since you find travel weeks more satisfying, try to identify what aspects of those weeks make you more productive. Is it the structure, the change of environment, or something else? See if you can incorporate some of those elements into your home routine.\n\nRemember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Your situation with work-from-home procrastination is actually pretty common, especially with flexible deadlines. The good news is that you already know you work well under different conditions (like during travel weeks), which gives us some clues about what might help.\n\nFirst, try recreating some of that \"travel week structure\" at home. Set specific work hours and treat them like you would if you were at a client site. Getting dressed for work and having a dedicated workspace can help shift your mindset from \"home mode\" to \"work mode.\"\n\nSince you're clearly capable of intense focus (those 15-hour crunch days prove that), consider using the Pomodoro Technique. Start with just 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. Even one or two \"pomodoros\" a day is better than nothing, and you'll likely find yourself wanting to do more once you start.\n\nBreak down that 30 hours of work into smaller daily chunks. Instead of thinking \"I have 30 hours to do whenever,\" schedule specific tasks for specific days. Make them non-negotiable appointments with yourself, just like you would treat client meetings during travel weeks.\n\nYou might also benefit from body-doubling - working alongside someone else, even virtually. There are online co-working spaces and Discord channels where people work together silently. This can help recreate that sense of accountability you feel when working on-site.\n\nRemember, you don't have to transform everything overnight. Start with small changes - maybe commit to working just 2 hours each morning before allowing yourself to bike or play chess. Build from there. The goal is to spread that work out so you can actually enjoy your free time without the constant dread of looming deadlines.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a common problem known as \"time inconsistency\" - you prioritize short-term leisure over long-term goals, even when it leads to more stress and discomfort in the end. One strategy that might help is to break down your 30 hours of work into smaller, manageable chunks, and schedule them into your calendar just like you would any other non-negotiable appointment. This could be as simple as committing to work 2-3 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or whatever schedule works best for you.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider implementing some \"implementation intentions\" - specific plans for when and where you will work on your tasks. For example, \"If it's Monday at 9am, then I will work on my report for 2 hours.\" This can help make your goals feel more concrete and achievable.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention enjoying your travel weeks more than working from home, despite the longer hours. This might suggest that having a structured schedule and clear deadlines can actually be helpful for you, even if it feels restrictive at first. You could try to replicate some of that structure while working from home, by setting clear goals and deadlines for yourself, and establishing a dedicated workspace that helps you get into \"work mode\".\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - completing a single task or making progress on your report can give you a sense of momentum and motivation that can carry over into the next day. Try to focus on making progress, rather than being perfect, and see if that helps you build some discipline and consistency into your work routine.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get the struggle. That \"freedom\" can be a real trap sometimes. It sounds like you're not lacking the ability to work hard, just the structure to do it consistently at home.\n\nHere's a thought: since you enjoy the travel weeks, try to mimic that structure at home. Could you create a \"travel day\" routine even when you're not traveling? Maybe that means waking up at the same time, getting dressed as if you were going to the office (even if it's just nicer sweats!), and designating a specific workspace that's only for work.\n\nAlso, break down that 30-hour report into much smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of \"work on report,\" try \"write the introduction\" or \"find three sources.\" Make those tasks so small you can't say no to them. Even 15 minutes of focused work is better than zero.\n\nFinally, consider timeboxing. Allocate specific blocks of time for work, even if it's just an hour or two each day. Set a timer, and when it goes off, you're done for that block. This can help you avoid burnout and build momentum. Good luck, you got this!\n"

I left my extremely toxic job in March and have bounced around dead end jobs since then. The only positive thing I have done for myself recently was to go back to school - but even that is challenging.

It sounds like you’re ready to take control, and that’s awesome. Here are a few things that might help:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It’s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one small habit to change first. Maybe it’s reducing your weed intake or setting a consistent wake-up time. Small wins build momentum.\n\n2. **Routine is Key**: Try to establish a simple daily routine. It doesn’t have to be rigid, but having a structure can help you feel more in control. Even just getting dressed in something other than sweatpants can make a difference in how you feel.\n\n3. **Accountability**: Since you mentioned wanting to be held accountable, consider finding a buddy or a community (like this one!) to check in with. Sometimes just knowing someone else is rooting for you can be motivating.\n\n4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that change is a process. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small.\n\n5. **Professional Help**: If you’re feeling really stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful.

        "claude_comment": "First off - recognizing you want to change and asking for help is a huge step. You're not alone in this struggle, and it's never too late to start building better habits.\n\nStarting with the weed - you're right that this needs to be addressed. Cannabis can seriously impact motivation and make everything feel more difficult than it needs to be. Consider checking out r/leaves for support in cutting back or quitting.\n\nHere's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start incredibly small. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once. Pick ONE tiny habit to build first - something so easy it feels almost ridiculous. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, or drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or putting on real clothes instead of sweats.\n\nThe key is consistency over intensity. Do that one small thing every single day for two weeks. Don't worry about anything else yet. Once that becomes automatic, add one more small habit. \n\nFor school specifically - set up your class materials the night before. Put everything by the door. Make it as brain-dead simple as possible to get to class, because when you're struggling with motivation, every tiny obstacle becomes a mountain.\n\nYou mentioned being exhausted with yourself - use that energy. Instead of beating yourself up about the past 3 years, channel that frustration into doing one small positive thing RIGHT NOW. Not tomorrow. Today. Even if it's just a 5-minute walk around the block or sending one job application.\n\nRemember: Progress isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days. The goal isn't perfection - it's just doing slightly better than yesterday. Keep showing up, keep trying, and those small consistent actions will compound over time.",

Starting small can be really helpful - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, try picking one or two things you'd like to focus on and build from there. For example, you could start by setting a goal to get dressed in something other than sweatpants every morning, or to take a short walk with your dogs each day. Having a routine can be really helpful for building momentum and motivation, so you might consider creating a schedule for yourself that includes time blocks for school, self-care, and relaxation. It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have setbacks - missing one class doesn't mean you're failing, and it's great that you're taking steps to get back on track. Remember that developing discipline and new habits takes time, and it's not always easy, but it sounds like you're ready to put in the work and make some positive changes in your life.

Don't beat yourself up for past \"failures,\" just focus on moving forward.\n\nSince you mentioned weed, tackling that is a great starting point. Maybe don't try to quit cold turkey right away. Instead, try gradually reducing your intake. Set small, achievable goals each day or week. There are also subreddits dedicated to quitting weed that could offer support.\n\nFor the general lack of motivation, start ridiculously small. Like, *really* small. Instead of \"I'm going to work out for an hour,\" try \"I'm going to put on my workout clothes.\" Or instead of \"I'm going to write a chapter of my paper,\" try \"I'm going to open my laptop and look at the document.\" The point is to make the initial step so easy that you can't say no. Once you've done that small thing, you'll often find it easier to keep going.\n\nAlso, schedule things, even small things. Put \"take a shower\" or \"walk the dogs for 10 minutes\" on your calendar. Seeing it written down can make it feel more real and less optional.\n\nFinally, remember why you want to change. You mentioned your dogs and your relationship.

The issue is that I feel like im losing all the things that made me happy and I just feel miserable despite making good progress on my goals. I love going out for food and I enjoy having some wine after work and with dinner to wind down. My new routine doesn't really allow for these things as I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit.

The good news is that this difficult phase usually does get easier with time as your body and mind adapt.\n\nInstead of viewing this as permanently giving up things you enjoy, try reframing it as finding new ways to get similar satisfaction. For example, you could experiment with making restaurant-quality meals at home (which lets you control portions and ingredients while still being a treat), or discover non-alcoholic ways to decompress after work like a fancy tea ritual or sparkling water mocktails.\n\nFor the tiredness from the caloric deficit - make sure you're not cutting calories too aggressively. A smaller deficit of 300-400 calories is often more sustainable than a larger one, even if progress is slower. Also consider timing your meals so you have more energy when you need it most.\n\nThe key is finding sustainable changes you can live with long-term, not white-knuckling through restriction.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to indulge every now and then, and it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach.\n\nYou might want to experiment with finding healthier alternatives to your favorite activities, like trying new recipes at home or finding low-calorie wine options.

Being in a calorie deficit can be tough, especially when combined with a stressful job and emotional exhaustion.

With those work hours, you'll want to be in bed by 10:30-11pm to get adequate rest before your 9am start. Create a wind-down routine starting an hour before bed - dim lights, avoid screens, maybe do some light stretching.\n\nFor managing daytime drowsiness: Get some movement in the morning before work, even just 10 minutes of stretching or a quick walk. When you feel that 11am slump coming, stand up and move around for 5 minutes. During lunch, try to get outside for 15 minutes - natural light helps regulate your energy levels.\n\nThe post-lunch crash around 2-3pm is super common. Keep your lunch moderate in size and low in simple carbs. Have healthy snacks ready (nuts, fruit) for when energy dips. Stay hydrated throughout the day too - dehydration makes fatigue worse.\n\nFor the evening slump, try changing tasks or taking a 5-minute break to do some jumping jacks or wall pushups. The physical movement can help push through until you finish work.\n\nStart implementing these changes gradually - maybe focus on sleep schedule first, then add the other elements over time.

Are you eating balanced meals with enough protein and complex carbs to sustain your energy throughout the day? Avoid sugary snacks that cause energy crashes.\n\nThird, schedule short breaks during your workday. Even 5-10 minutes every hour to stand up, stretch, or walk around can make a big difference. Maybe try a quick power nap during your lunch break if you can.\n\nFinally, consider light exercise. Even a short walk in the morning or evening can boost your energy levels and improve your sleep. Experiment and see what works best for you! Good luck, you got this!\n"

I would like advice, if there is any to give, on finding a way to eat the same amounts I am, and feel satisfied or full for it. I don't need the advice for losing weight, I (M, 23) feel fine at ~180 lbs. The reason to want this change is budget related, where I'm getting into a situation where I can't always just buy snacks, or make more food. Google is surprisingly unhelpful, only offering weight loss solutions - and maybe that's not a bad idea, but not what I'm looking for. I'd like suggestions on ways to feel fuller after a meal while eating the same (or less).\n\nMaybe this gets asked a bunch,  but this is not a life-ending problem so if the post dies in new, no harm no foul.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're looking for ways to feel more satisfied with your meals without increasing your food budget. Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Focus on Protein and Fiber**: These nutrients can help you feel fuller for longer. Try incorporating more beans, lentils, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or tofu into your meals.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day, and try having a glass before meals to help with satiety.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Slow down and really savor your food. Eating more slowly can give your body time to register fullness. Try putting your fork down between bites or chewing more thoroughly.\n\n4. **Volume Eating**: Add more low-calorie, high-volume foods like vegetables to your meals. They can bulk up your plate and help you feel more satisfied without adding a lot of calories.\n\n5. **Healthy Fats**: Including a small amount of healthy fats like avocado, nuts, or olive oil can also help with satiety.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works for you and your lifestyle. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you feel more satisfied with your meals!",
        "claude_comment": "There are several effective ways to feel more satisfied while eating the same amount or less. First, try eating more protein-rich foods and fiber in your meals - these help with satiety much more than simple carbs. Add eggs to breakfast, lean meats to lunch/dinner, and include vegetables with every meal.\n\nDrinking water before and during meals can help too. Sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger. A glass of water 15-20 minutes before eating can make a real difference.\n\nThe speed at which you eat matters a lot. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness signals. Try putting your fork down between bites and chewing thoroughly. This gives your body time to recognize it's getting full.\n\nConsider the composition of your meals too. Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados, nuts, olive oil) can help you feel fuller longer. Complex carbs like brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes are more filling than their refined counterparts.\n\nLastly, mindful eating helps - no TV or phone while eating. Focus on your food and you'll likely feel more satisfied with your portions. These aren't quick fixes, but implementing even a couple of these strategies should help you feel more satisfied without increasing portion sizes or food costs.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're looking to increase satiety without necessarily changing your overall diet or calorie intake. One thing you might consider is focusing on more filling foods, such as those high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. These nutrients tend to be more satisfying and can help keep you feeling fuller for longer. For example, adding some nuts or seeds to your meals, or incorporating more lean proteins like chicken or fish, could make a difference. Additionally, drinking water before and during meals can also help with feelings of fullness. Another strategy is to slow down while eating and pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues - sometimes our brains can take a bit to catch up with our stomachs, so giving yourself time to feel satisfied can be helpful. You might also experiment with different spices and seasonings to make your meals more flavorful, which can help you feel more satisfied with the same amount of food. Lastly, considering your budget constraints, planning your meals and snacks in advance could help you make the most of what you have and reduce the need for extra purchases. Have you tried any of these approaches or is there something specific that's holding you back from feeling full after meals?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get where you're coming from. Feeling hungry all the time when you're trying to budget sucks. It's definitely doable to feel fuller without drastically changing your diet or aiming for weight loss.\n\nA couple of things to try: First, focus on fiber and protein. These take longer to digest and can really help with satiety. Think about adding a side of beans to your lunch or dinner, or maybe swapping white bread for whole wheat. Even a handful of nuts as a snack could make a difference.\n\nSecond, water is your friend. Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water before your meals and see if that helps curb your appetite. Also, make sure you're drinking enough throughout the day.\n\nThird, mindful eating can be surprisingly effective. Slow down, put your fork down between bites, and really focus on the taste and texture of your food. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to register that you're full, so eating slower gives it a chance to catch up.\n\nFinally, consider the volume of your food. You can increase the volume of your meals without adding a ton of calories by incorporating things like leafy greens or broth-based soups. A big salad before your main course could help you feel more satisfied with a smaller portion of the main dish. Good luck!\n"

The key is to build momentum with small wins.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time.

Consistency is crucial in building discipline.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process.\n\nThis subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes.

It could be making your bed, doing 5 pushups, or reading one page of a book. Do just that one thing consistently for a week. Don't worry about anything else on your to-do list right now.\n\nThe goal isn't the task itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on a commitment. Once that small habit feels automatic (usually takes 1-2 weeks), add another tiny task. \n\nThis approach works because it:\n1) Prevents the overwhelm that's currently paralyzing you\n2) Builds momentum through small wins\n3) Rewires your brain to associate action with positive feelings\n\nRemember: You don't need motivation to act.

To start building a different mindset, I'd recommend beginning with small, manageable tasks that you can accomplish daily. This will help you build momentum and confidence. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your goals into tiny, bite-sized chunks. For example, if you want to start exercising, commit to doing just 5-10 minutes of stretching or a short walk each day. As you consistently complete these small tasks, you'll start to develop a sense of discipline and productivity that can then be applied to larger goals. It's also important to set clear priorities and focus on one task at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by your entire to-do list. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.

Like, if you want to read more, aim for reading just one page a day. If you want to exercise, do 5 minutes of stretching. The point isn't the accomplishment itself, it's building the habit of *starting*.\n\nOnce you've consistently done that tiny thing for a week or two, *then* you can gradually increase it. The momentum will surprise you.\n\nAs for mindset, it's less about a sudden shift and more about consistent action. Each small win builds confidence and makes the next step easier.

It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\n\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\n\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not a failure. You have a job, you're in school, you take care of your appearance, and most importantly - you WANT to improve. That's a solid foundation to build from.\n\nLet's tackle this step by step. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE small habit to master first. Since you mentioned feeling physically bad, let's start with water intake. Get a large water bottle and keep it with you always. Set specific times to drink - when you wake up, with meals, etc. Make it dead simple.\n\nFor the binge eating, especially on non-medication days, try planning your meals in advance. Prep healthy snacks and meals when you're on Vyvanse and feeling motivated. That way, when the harder days come, you just need to heat up what's already made. The goal isn't perfection - it's making the healthy choice slightly easier than the unhealthy one.\n\nFor productivity and focus, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day. Your brain is like a muscle - you need to gradually build up its capacity for sustained focus. Don't expect to maintain the same productivity level off-medication as on it. Instead, adjust your expectations and create different routines for different days.\n\nWhen you slip up (which everyone does), don't view it as starting over. Think of it like GPS recalculating - you're just finding a new route to the same destination. Keep a simple journal noting what triggers your binges or productivity dips. This info will help you adjust your strategy over time.\n\nRemember: discipline isn't about being perfect every day. It's about showing up consistently and making slightly better choices over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.",

First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing these patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. \n\nGiven your ADHD diagnosis and medication schedule, it might be helpful to focus on building small, manageable habits on your non-medication days. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start with tiny goals like drinking one extra glass of water or taking a short 10-minute walk. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum.\n\nIt's also important to address the binge eating and emotional relationship with food. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders - they can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues. \n\nIn terms of rewiring your brain for discipline, it's not about being perfect, but about making progress. You might find it helpful to set clear, achievable goals for yourself, break them down into smaller tasks, and create an environment that supports those goals (e.g., removing tempting foods from your home, finding a workout buddy, etc.). \n\nRemember, discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it's okay if you don't see immediate results. It's about showing up every day, making small efforts, and being kind to yourself when you slip up.

You're already doing a lot – college, a job, taking care of yourself. That's not nothing! It's easy to get caught up in what you *aren't* doing, but try to acknowledge what you *are* accomplishing.\n\nRegarding discipline, it's not about a complete brain reset. It's more like training a muscle. Start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's drinking more water. Set a realistic goal – like one extra glass a day – and build from there. When you've nailed that, add another small change.\n\nFor the food and phone cravings, try to identify your triggers. When do you usually reach for those things? Can you replace them with something else? Maybe a walk, a quick meditation, or even just a different app on your phone. There are apps that can help you limit your time on social media, which might be useful.\n\nAbout your meds, have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling on and off them? Maybe there's a tweak that could help with the binge eating on your off days. It's also worth exploring therapy, especially for the binge eating disorder. A therapist can give you tools to manage those urges and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nAs for staying focused, the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks) can be really helpful for ADHD. It breaks down tasks into manageable chunks and gives you built-in rewards.\n\nFinally, remember that setbacks are normal. Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You've got this! Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n"

Additionally, \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport could provide some useful strategies for overcoming procrastination and staying focused.\n\nLastly, don't give up on finding a good therapist - it's worth the effort to find someone who can support you through this challenging time. And try not to worry too much about losing your job - you've made it this far, and with time and practice, you'll become more confident in your abilities.

It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, but it's awesome you're self-aware and want to improve.\n\nFirst, imposter syndrome is super common, especially when starting a new job. Instead of focusing on what you *don't* know, try to track what you *are* learning each week. Even small things. Write them down. It'll help you see your progress and build confidence. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help, but try to frame your questions as \"I've tried X and Y, and I'm still stuck on Z. Any suggestions?\" This shows initiative.\n\nFor getting back into a productive groove, maybe start small. Instead of trying to sit for hours like you used to, aim for 25-minute focused sessions (Pomodoro Technique). Then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. It's easier to build momentum that way.\n\nAs for books, \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear is a classic for building good habits and breaking bad ones. It's really practical and easy to implement. Also, maybe look into books on time management or productivity specifically for software engineers – there might be some tailored advice out there.\n\nFinding a new therapist sucks, but don't give up. In the meantime, are there any friends or family members you can confide in? Sometimes just talking things out can help.\n\nFinally, remember that it's okay to not be perfect. You're 23, you're learning, and you're doing great things. Focus on small, consistent improvements, and you'll get there. You got this!\n"

When you try to fix everything at once, you'll get overwhelmed and fall back into old patterns. Start with something simple like making your bed every morning or going for a 10-minute walk. Do it every day for two weeks straight. No exceptions.\n\nFor the porn and fapping - install website blockers and keep your phone out of your bedroom. Fill that time with literally anything else - pushups, reading, drawing, whatever. The urges will suck at first but they do get easier to manage.\n\nThe anxiety and mental health stuff - look into free counseling services in your area. Many places offer sliding scale fees or programs for people without income. Your brain is like any other organ - sometimes it needs professional help to work right.\n\nFor the job situation - start small here too. Update your resume and apply to just one job per day. Doesn't matter if you feel qualified. Just one application daily.\n\nYou're not broken or hopeless - you're just stuck in some bad loops that can be fixed one small step at a time.

Now, instead of beating yourself up over past choices, maybe try to focus on what small steps you can take today to move towards the person you want to be. \n\nHave you considered seeking out professional help for your anxiety and addiction?

It's cost me every job and hobby I've ever had and it's cost me the love of my life. \n\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I've been a game developer for a decade and I've never finished a game. I've been playing musical instruments and singing my entire life but I've never managed to learn sheet music or any scales or arpeggios on anything. Believe me I have tried.

I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \n\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I’m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\n\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I’d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don’t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I’d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn’t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn’t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \n\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly.

Instead of seeing it as a rigid, external force, think of it as a tool that helps you achieve what you truly want. Start small—pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas.

        "claude_comment": "First off, you're already ahead of many people by identifying the root cause - that's huge. The good news is that deep-seated aversions can absolutely be rewired, but it requires a different approach than traditional discipline-based methods.\n\nStart by completely removing the word \"discipline\" from your vocabulary for now. Instead, think in terms of tiny experiments and play. Your brain has associated discipline with threat, so we need to bypass that defense mechanism entirely.\n\nPick something absurdly small related to one of your interests - so small it feels almost meaningless. For game dev, maybe it's opening your development environment for 30 seconds. For music, maybe it's playing a single note. The key is to make it so easy that your brain's defenses don't activate.\n\nDo this tiny thing once. That's it. No pressure to continue, no expectations of progress. The next day, do it again. If you feel any resistance, make it even smaller. We're building evidence for your brain that engaging with these activities is safe.\n\nOnly once these micro-actions feel completely neutral (usually takes 1-2 weeks) do you slightly expand them. Add 30 more seconds. Play two notes instead of one. The moment you feel that wall coming up, scale back immediately.\n\nThis isn't about willpower or pushing through. It's about gradually proving to your nervous system that these activities are safe and rewarding. Many people have overcome similar aversions this way - by going so small that the brain's protective mechanisms don't get triggered.\n\nRemember: You're not trying to fix yourself or overcome anything. You're just running tiny, safe experiments to collect data. That's all.",
        "llama_comment": "It's amazing that you've identified the root cause of your struggles, and that in itself is a huge step forward. Overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline won't be easy, but it's definitely possible. One approach could be to start by reframing your perception of discipline - instead of seeing it as a restrictive or punitive force, try to view it as a tool for achieving freedom and autonomy in the areas that matter most to you. \n\nFor example, as a game developer, you might start by setting incredibly small, almost ridiculously easy goals for yourself, like working on a project for just 5-10 minutes a day. This can help build momentum and make the idea of discipline less daunting. It's also important to focus on progress, not perfection - don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, just acknowledge the setback and get back on track.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore the underlying reasons for your aversion to discipline. Was there a particular event or experience in your childhood that led to this feeling? Understanding the root cause can help you address it more effectively. Additionally, consider seeking out supportive communities or accountability partners who can encourage and motivate you without being too pushy or demanding.\n\nAs for people who have overcome similar challenges, there are many stories of individuals who have successfully developed discipline and achieved their goals despite initial resistance. It's often a matter of finding the right strategies, support systems, and mindset shifts that work for you. You might find inspiration in the stories of people like James Clear, who writes about building good habits and overcoming obstacles, or Josh Waitzkin, who has written about cultivating discipline and resilience in pursuit of his passions.\n\nRemember, overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take it one step at a time, and to be patient with yourself as you work through this process.

It's awesome that you're actively trying to understand and address it.\n\nInstead of tackling \"discipline\" head-on, maybe try reframing it. Think of it less as a rigid set of rules and more as a set of *agreements* you make with yourself to achieve something you genuinely want.\n\nSince you're a game developer, could you gamify your own life? Break down tasks into tiny, achievable quests with small rewards. Focus on the *process* of building a habit, not the *outcome* of finishing a game or mastering scales. For example, instead of \"learn scales,\" try \"practice one scale for 5 minutes every day.\" The goal is consistency, not perfection.\n\nAlso, consider therapy if you aren't already. A therapist specializing in trauma or attachment issues might help you unpack the childhood roots of this aversion and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself.

Outside of those times, keep the apps deleted or logged out. This can help you regain control over when and how you use them.\n\n2. **Find Alternatives**: Since you mentioned not having a huge social life right now, maybe look into activities that can fill that gap. Joining clubs, taking classes, or even online communities focused on your interests can provide that social interaction without the endless scroll.\n\n3. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware of your goals can be a great motivator.\n\n4. **Mindfulness**: When you feel the urge to redownload or check the apps, pause and ask yourself what you're hoping to get out of it. Sometimes just being aware of the impulse can help you redirect it.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection.

        "claude_comment": "First off, congrats on the progress you've already made - quitting smoking and building healthy habits like reading and working out is huge. Social media addiction is definitely challenging because unlike other habits, total elimination isn't always practical in today's world.\n\nSince you mentioned missing out on communication, try setting specific \"social media hours\" - maybe 30 minutes in the morning and evening to catch up with people. This lets you maintain connections while containing usage to defined periods. During these windows, be intentional about actually engaging (commenting, messaging friends) rather than mindless scrolling.\n\nFor the redownloading cycle, make it harder on yourself. Use app blockers that require a waiting period to disable. Log out of accounts so you need to enter passwords each time. Move social apps to a folder on the last page of your phone. The goal is to add friction between the impulse and action.\n\nTo address the social life aspect - consider joining some local groups related to your interests (reading clubs, fitness classes, etc). Having more in-person social outlets naturally reduces the pull of social media. You could also schedule regular calls/meetups with friends so you're getting that connection without defaulting to apps.\n\nRemember that building discipline isn't about perfection. If you slip up, just reset and try again. The fact that you're conscious of the issue and actively working on it means you're already on the right path.",

One strategy that might help is to replace social media with other activities that give you a sense of connection, like joining online forums or groups related to your interests, or scheduling regular video calls with friends and family. This way, you can still feel connected without mindlessly scrolling through Snapchat and Instagram. \n\nAnother approach could be to set specific goals for what you want to achieve during the week, and then use website blockers or app limitations to help you stay on track. For example, you could allow yourself to check social media only after you've completed a certain task or reached a milestone. It's also worth considering why you feel the need to check social media in the first place - is it boredom, loneliness, or something else? Once you identify the underlying reason, you can start working on alternative solutions to address that feeling. \n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's not about being 99% efficient all the time.

For example, if you want to write a book, start with writing 100 words a day.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your new habit at the same time every day. This helps your brain associate that time with the activity, making it easier to stick with it.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, no matter how small. This positive reinforcement can help keep you motivated.\n\n6. **Be Patient and Kind to Yourself**: Change takes time, and setbacks are part of the process. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day—just get back on track the next day.\n\nRemember, building discipline and creativity is a journey, not a sprint. Good luck, and keep pushing forward!",
        "claude_comment": "The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum gradually. Your brain won't rewire overnight, but you can train it through consistent tiny actions. Pick one simple thing you want to do - maybe writing for 5 minutes, drawing for 10 minutes, or working on a project for 15 minutes. Make it so easy you can't say no.\n\nThen set a specific time each day for this mini-task. The time of day matters less than consistency. When that time comes, just do that one tiny thing. Don't worry about doing more, even if you feel motivated to. Build the habit first.\n\nAfter a couple weeks of consistency with your mini-task, you can gradually increase the time or add another small habit. The goal is to prove to yourself that you can follow through. Each small win reinforces that you ARE capable of doing things, not just dreaming about them.\n\nFor the creativity aspect - set aside dedicated time to consume inspiring content in your field of interest, but limit it to maybe 20% of your practice time. The other 80% should be actually creating, even if it's bad at first. Remember that all those successful people you admire started somewhere too, usually with work they weren't proud of.\n\nYour brain will resist change at first. That's normal. But if you stick to tiny, consistent actions, you'll slowly build new neural pathways. Focus on the process rather than results. Show up daily for your mini-task, celebrate small wins, and trust that compound interest works with habits too.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a motivation gap, which is totally common. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as doing one load of laundry, or spending 10 minutes working on a creative project. The idea is to build momentum and get yourself used to taking action, rather than just imagining it. Additionally, you might find it helpful to explore the concept of \"implementation intentions\" - this is where you specify when and where you'll take a specific action, which can help make it feel more concrete and achievable. For example, you might say to yourself \"at 7am tomorrow, I'll spend 30 minutes working on my novel\". By making a clear plan and starting small, you can begin to build discipline and creativity habits that will serve you well in the long run.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough when you feel stuck in that cycle of wanting to do things but not actually doing them. The good news is, you *can* change it. It's not about \"rewiring\" your brain overnight, but more about building momentum with small, consistent actions.\n\nFirst, stop comparing yourself to others. Seriously. It's a motivation killer. Instead, focus on *one tiny* thing you want to achieve. Like, ridiculously tiny. Want to write? Commit to writing one sentence a day. Want to exercise? Do one push-up. The point is to make it so easy you can't say no.\n\nOnce you've consistently done that tiny thing for a week or two, *then* you can gradually increase it. One sentence becomes two, one push-up becomes two. The key is consistency over intensity.\n\nAlso, break down bigger goals into smaller, manageable steps. \"Make changes to my life\" is huge and overwhelming. Instead, think \"What's one small thing I can do *today* that will move me in the right direction?\"\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're going to slip up. It happens. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "I've been very consistent and disciplined about the past 6 months. Early on, I read articles on preventing burnout and they said I need to eat healthier, drink water, etc. and so I prioritised those things. I also prioritised having a good social life, sleep, having a clean environment etc. But I was still experiencing burnout and I decided to do the bare minimum for a week and my personality had a radical change - I was much calmer, happier and rational. In other words, my burnout decreased significantly. That means it was these healthy things that were causing my burnout. How do I prevent burnout from taking care of myself?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much!",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I think you may have fallen into the trap of toxic productivity, or the idea that you should be productive all of the time. Applied to self care that would be the idea that you have to always eat healthy, always sleep 8 hours a night, meditate everyday, etc. And those are very important, but you shouldn’t obsess about them. It’s okay to not do those things sometimes. It’s all about balance.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "You pay attention to how you feel and what is happening for you in any moment, and you honour that. In my experience rest is the most important form of self care and also the most underrated in a society that is so focused on output. So, build in more time for rest, adjust your expectations of yourself when it comes to how much you want to get done and find ways to get what your body needs that aren’t creating more stress. \n\nSelf care should never be about ticking boxes, it’s about learning to listen to yourself and using that information to determine what you need the most at that time. It could be rest, or social time or saying no to something - you don’t know until you stop and assess where you are right now.\n\nGood luck OP 😊",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you've been doing a lot to take care of yourself, which is awesome, but it’s possible to overdo even the good stuff. Self-care should feel like a break, not another item on your to-do list. Maybe try simplifying your routine and focusing on what truly makes you feel good rather than what you think you should be doing. It’s okay to have days where you just do the basics and give yourself permission to relax. Also, consider mixing in activities that are purely for fun or creativity, without any pressure to achieve something. Balance is key, and sometimes less is more. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!",
        "claude_comment": "It sounds like you might be approaching self-care as another set of tasks to rigidly complete rather than activities that should make you feel better. Self-care shouldn't feel like a burden - it's about finding the right balance that works for you.\n\nTry scaling back to focus on what actually makes you feel good and energized. Not every healthy habit needs to happen every single day. Maybe you feel great after socializing twice a week rather than forcing yourself to go out every night. Or perhaps meal prepping on Sundays works better than cooking fresh daily.\n\nStart by picking 2-3 core habits that give you the most benefit and make those non-negotiable. Then treat the others as \"nice to haves\" that you can flex around your energy levels. The goal is sustainable progress, not perfection.\n\nRemember that rest and downtime are also forms of self-care. If taking a week to do the bare minimum helped you feel better, that's valuable information. Consider building regular \"low power mode\" days into your routine where you deliberately dial things back. This isn't failing at self-care - it's actually listening to what your body and mind need.\n\nThe best self-care routine is one you can maintain long-term without burning out. Keep what works, modify or drop what doesn't, and be willing to adjust as needed.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've stumbled upon a really interesting insight - that sometimes, even good habits can contribute to burnout if they become too overwhelming or rigid. One potential approach could be to re-evaluate your self-care routine and see if there are any areas where you can scale back or make things more flexible. For example, instead of feeling like you need to cook a healthy meal every night, maybe you could aim for 3-4 nights a week and give yourself permission to have something simpler the other nights. Similarly, you might consider prioritizing the self-care activities that bring you the most joy and relaxation, and letting go of any that feel more like obligations. By finding a better balance and being kinder to yourself, you may be able to reduce your risk of burnout while still taking care of your physical and emotional needs.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that's a really interesting situation! It sounds like you've been super dedicated, which is awesome, but also highlights a key point: self-care isn't one-size-fits-all.\n\nIt seems like you might have been overdoing it, turning self-care into another set of rigid rules. The goal is to *reduce* stress, not add to it. Maybe you were trying to optimize everything at once, which can be exhausting in itself.\n\nInstead of a blanket approach, try experimenting to find what *actually* recharges you. Maybe a super clean environment is less important than, say, 15 minutes of reading a fun book. Or maybe forcing a social life when you need alone time is draining.\n\nThink about what truly relaxes you and makes you feel good, and then prioritize *those* things. Also, consider that your needs might change over time. What works now might not work in a few months, so be open to adjusting your routine. It's about finding a sustainable balance, not achieving some perfect ideal of \"healthy living.\" Good luck!\n"

      "body": "i’m recovering from severe trauma (in therapy) and some days are good, most are normal, but some are really bad. one traumatic memory or flashback is enough to ruin my whole day and productivity. one traumatic memory leads to another and soon there’s a whirlpool in my head and now i can’t study anymore. and even when the memories have stopped i can’t snap back to my previous mental state and temperament and the gross feeling in my stomach remains the whole day. how do i get out of this funk and not let my whole day go to waste?",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "This has been me for years and I think I’ve finally found a way to overcome this. As far as my story goes, I had a traumatic brain injury 12 years ago, followed by trauma with friends, family, roommates, employers… the whole shebang. But I’m an engineer, so I’ve spent the last 12 years trying to find a solution to all of my issues. Obsessed with it really. If you want tips on other approaches to handling trauma, like mindsets, routines, supplements, or life style, you can DM me and I’d be happy to offer some simple, small steps you could take to help in those areas too. \n\nBut as far as the one thing that finally helped me get out of bed and stop playing minesweeper for hours on end is massaging my body. This relieved the build up of tension in my body, which eased the tension in my mind. \n\nThis might sound antithetical to fixing your thoughts, but despite everything I’ve tried this is the biggest thing that’s calmed my thoughts. It makes perfect sense to me why it works too, but unfortunately it isn’t used a whole lot in the western world’s counseling. It’s picking up, but it’s still in its infancy. \n\nAnyway, the body and the mind are one thing: the brain and the nervous system. You notice how when you get nervous you tense up? Or when you get angry you have this build up of energy that makes you want to punch something? Or when you’re shy you just want to curl up in a ball? This is your mind telling your body how to react to these emotions… how to handle the energy behind these emotions… to release the build up of energy (anger) or to preserve the little energy you have left (exhaustion). \n\nBut the nervous system is a two way street. Just as the mind can tell the body how to behave, the body can tell the mind how to behave. \n\nTrauma is a psychological condition that affects our entire nervous system. This explains the cramp you feel in your stomach. Our nervous system is what’s responsible for all of our organs. It’s what relays messages from the mind to your stomach to tell you you’re full, for example. So the traumatic thoughts you’re having and the tension you feel in your body are one illness. Helping one helps the other. \n\nAs for how to massage, here’s my routine. I like doing things bottom up, step by step, but you can do it in whatever way feels comfortable for you. If my description is too much for you right now that’s ok, just start with the first one and you can slowly work in the other ones later at whatever feels comfortable for you. \n\nIf you have a massage ball or anything you can roll on your skin that would help too, but it isn’t needed.  Some important notes are included. \n\n1. Feet. Start here. They have over 2000 nerves and are an important player in releasing tension. They’re what ground us to this planet and are what support our entire structure. \n\n2. Slowly work you’re way up each leg. You can do one at a time or both, it doesn’t matter. \n\n3. Once you’re up to the thighs, play close attention to your inner thighs. The sacral nerve is here and it’s a very important nerve to massage. It’s a main nerve that’s responsible for your bladder and rectal muscles. Massage will  especially help if you have diarrhea or constipation. \n\n4. Slowly work your way up the side of your torso and gently massaging your abdomen. Massaging your sides will help calm your vagus nerve, which is a main nerve responsible for digestion, heart rate, and immune system. Likely responsible for your stomach issues. \n\n5. Arms. Start by placing your hands on the opposite shoulder and giving yourself a hug. Give just a gentle squeeze and slowly work your way down your arms, to your wrists, and back up again. Do this a couple times if it feels comfortable and end by massaging the back of each shoulder. The gentle hug isn’t only good for your nervous system, but your psyche as well, often bringing us back to memories of being loved as a little kid, and receiving protection. \n\n6. Massage the sides of the neck. The vagus nerve runs through here and is a good spot to massage. \n\n7. The head. Slowly start from the bottom, working your way up to your scalp. The jaw often holds a lot of tension for a lot of people and is a really good spot to focus on. If you have real vagus nerve issues like I do, the ear area is a really good spot to focus on too, specifically the left ear. It’s where the nerve starts. Be gentle here. The ear:\n1. Massage above the ear, gently moving the skin in whatever way feels comfortable. \n2. Place your finger in the ridge of your lobe, just gently moving around. It doesn’t take much movement here. \n3. Place your pinky finger inside your ear and very gently push against the back of your ear. \n\nYou can finish massaging your scalp and you’re done! \n\nNotice how your thoughts are now. They should likely be much more relaxed. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions if you have any.",

        "gpt_comment": "I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds tough, but it's great that you're in therapy and working on recovery. When those tough days hit, it might help to have a few strategies ready to ground yourself and regain some control. One approach is to create a \"reset routine\"—a series of small, comforting actions that help you shift your focus. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing some deep breathing exercises, or listening to a favorite song. These activities can help break the cycle of negative thoughts and give you a moment to regroup. Also, try setting very small, manageable goals for the day. Even if you can't be as productive as you'd like, accomplishing something small can help you feel a bit more in control. Remember, it's okay to have off days, and being kind to yourself is also a form of discipline. Keep going, and take it one step at a time.",
        "claude_comment": "First, it's great that you're already working with a therapist - that's a huge step. For managing those difficult days when memories intrude, try creating a \"reset routine\" - a series of small, manageable actions you can do to help ground yourself and gradually return to productivity.\n\nA simple reset routine might be: stepping outside for 5 minutes of fresh air, doing 10 slow breaths, drinking a glass of water, and washing your face with cold water. The physical sensations can help bring you back to the present moment.\n\nWhen you're having a particularly rough day, instead of trying to force yourself back to full productivity, try the \"5-minute rule.\" Tell yourself you'll work on something for just 5 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and you might find yourself able to continue once you begin. If not, that's okay too - even 5 minutes of progress is better than none.\n\nBreaking your work into smaller chunks can also help. Rather than thinking \"I need to study for 3 hours,\" try \"I'll read one page\" or \"I'll solve one problem.\" This makes tasks feel more manageable when you're not at 100%.\n\nRemember that recovery isn't linear, and some days will be harder than others. Having strategies ready for those tough days isn't admitting defeat - it's smart planning. Keep building your toolkit of coping strategies with your therapist, and be proud of any progress you make, no matter how small it seems.",
        "llama_comment": "It's completely understandable that traumatic memories can be overwhelming and affect your daily life. One strategy that might help is to develop a \"reset routine\" for when you feel like you're getting pulled into that whirlpool. This could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or doing some light stretching - anything that helps signal to your brain that it's time to shift gears. Additionally, you might consider setting a \"re-entry point\" for when you feel like you're ready to start being productive again, like making a cup of tea or doing a quick creative activity. This can help you gradually come back to a more focused state without feeling overwhelmed. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be okay, and some days it's just about survival - so don't be too hard on yourself if you can't get everything done that you wanted to. Have you talked to your therapist about developing some coping strategies for when these memories come up, or are there any specific techniques they've recommended that you've found helpful?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds really tough, and it's awesome you're in therapy working through it. It's totally understandable that those days can derail you.\n\nHere's a thought: instead of trying to instantly \"snap back,\" maybe focus on damage control and harm reduction for those days. When you feel that whirlpool starting, could you try a pre-planned \"reset\" activity? Something short and specific that you know can ground you a little. It could be a 5-minute meditation, a quick walk outside, listening to a favorite song, or even just making a cup of tea and focusing on the sensations.\n\nThe key is to have it ready to go, so you don't have to think about it in the moment. Think of it like a fire extinguisher for your brain. It won't solve everything, but it might stop the fire from spreading.\n\nAlso, maybe lower your expectations for productivity on those days. Instead of aiming to study like normal, could you aim for something smaller and more manageable? Like, \"I'll read one chapter\" or \"I'll work on this for 30 minutes.\" Even a little progress is a win. And be kind to yourself – recovery isn't linear.\n"

You could also treat yourself to a nice dinner or try a new recipe.

It hurts me so much when I think of him--because he is one of the smartest, most capable people I know. He also had trauma, and in his case he couldn't go out due to social anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I would do is try to change how you view yourself. It seems like you are on the right track for that--taking care of your body and mind plays a big role in that respect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's true that in life, connections and background get you far. You do need to put your foot in the door to move forward. But at the end of the day, you have to acknowledge that you are in control of your future. Yes, at this point it may be harder for you to make it than it would be for someone with tons of connections. But our hardships only mean something if we decide to take them lying down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI might recommend something--whatever you're trying to aim for, try and make incremental steps every day towards that goal. If for you that's a job, then apply to at least three-four jobs a day. No matter how shitty you feel while you're doing it(I know it can feel really intimidating), do it anyway. It may only take an hour or two. When you're done, not only can you acknowledge that you did something incredibly substantial in a short amount of time, you've just improved your chances of getting a job you want. If you want to go really hard, add on top of that--you have to cold-email/message someone at a company you want to work for. Do that, and you're a god.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep a calendar in your room, and every time you finish your step for the day, cross off a date. Do everything you can to not break your chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to hold this practice when doing something difficult for me--I count down from ten, and by the time I reach 0, I have to start the task. This gets rid of the anxiety associated with starting in the first place. This applies to social situations too--I count down from 5, and by the time I reach zero, I have to go interact with whoever I have to, whether that be a stranger, a cashier, or a long-time friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen doing all of this stuff, it's okay to sometimes struggle through the tasks. Starting and showing up are more important. HOWEVER, IMO it's never okay to not believe in yourself. When you're filling out job applications, know that one day, you will get the job you're looking for. That doesn't mean never learn from mistakes, that means have faith in the process of progress. Small steps lead to big changes over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. I'd recommend starting by doing something simple now, *right now*, like making your bed. See what difference it makes over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, don't let the label of NEET define you. Yes, you are a 'NEET' right now. But tell yourself that you only need to take more chances. Being a NEET doesn't mean you can't succeed, and don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You need to get lucky. But luck comes to those who search for it. If you try enough times, even if your success is 1 in 100, you'll  likely get it after 100 tries.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there, first off, I want to say that it's a big deal that you're reaching out and trying to make changes. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and the fact that you're sober and starting to take care of yourself is a huge step forward. \n\nBuilding discipline is like building a muscle; it takes time and consistent effort. Start small and be patient with yourself. You've already begun with daily tasks like laundry and brushing your teeth, which is awesome. Try to add one new habit at a time. Maybe set a goal to go for a short walk every day or spend 10 minutes writing, since you mentioned you have skills in that area. \n\nRoutine can be your best friend. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day. It might help to write down a simple daily schedule and stick to it as best as you can. Celebrate small victories, like completing a task or sticking to your routine for a week. \n\nAlso, don't hesitate to lean on your therapist for support and guidance. They can help you navigate this journey and offer strategies tailored to your needs. Remember, it's never too late to learn and grow. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're already making progress. Getting into daily hygiene and basic household tasks after years of struggle is a real achievement. Don't minimize that. You're not \"too late\" at 22 - you're actually catching things relatively early, considering what you've been through.\n\nThe fact that you're sober, in therapy, and actively working to change shows incredible resilience. Now let's build on that momentum.\n\nStart by creating a bare-minimum daily routine. You've got hygiene and some household tasks - excellent foundation. Add one small thing at a time. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, or a 5-minute walk outside, or reading one page of a book. The key is to keep it ridiculously simple at first.\n\nSince you mentioned writing skills, consider starting a simple journal. Just 5 minutes each day to track your progress and thoughts. This can help you recognize your improvements over time, which is crucial when you're rebuilding.\n\nFor work experience - look into remote writing gigs. Content writing, copywriting, or technical writing can be good entry points. Start small with platforms like Upwork or by building a portfolio on Medium. This lets you work from home while building experience.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, and that's normal. The goal isn't perfection - it's just doing a bit better than yesterday.\n\nYou've already proven you can change by getting sober and establishing basic routines. Keep building on that foundation, one small step at a time. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It's amazing that you've started taking care of yourself with daily tasks like laundry and showering - that's a huge step forward. Given your history, it's understandable that you feel like you're behind or that you'll never catch up, but the truth is that everyone develops at their own pace. The fact that you're in therapy and have stopped using substances is a testament to your strength and willingness to change.\n\nRather than focusing on what you haven't learned or accomplished, try to build on the small wins you've had so far. You mentioned you have skills in writing - why not start by setting aside some time each day or week to work on a writing project? It could be as simple as journaling or writing short stories. This can help you build confidence and a sense of purpose.\n\nIt's also great that you're recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself and your living space. Consider breaking down larger tasks, like cleaning and organizing your room, into smaller, manageable chunks. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nRemember that you don't have to do this alone. Your therapist is there to support you, and you may also want to consider joining a support group or finding online communities of people who are going through similar experiences. Having a network of people who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself. You've been through an enormous amount of trauma, and it's okay that you're not where you want to be yet. You're taking steps towards healing and growth, and that's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, even if it feels like a slow process - every step you take is a step away from the life you don't want and towards the one you do.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, first off, huge respect for sharing all that. It takes serious guts. You've already made massive progress just by getting sober and starting those daily hygiene habits. That's not nothing, that's a foundation.\n\nIt sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to catch up all at once. Instead of trying to overhaul everything, maybe focus on one or two small, achievable goals each week. Since you mentioned writing skills, could you commit to writing for just 15 minutes a day? Or maybe try going for a short walk outside each morning? Small wins build momentum and confidence.\n\nAlso, dealing with a NEET brother who's still struggling with addiction is a huge weight. Have you considered Al-Anon or a similar support group for family members of addicts? It could give you some tools to navigate that situation and protect your own sobriety and mental health.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about the past. You're not the same person you were then. You're actively working on yourself, and that's what matters. Keep going to therapy, be patient with yourself, and celebrate every small victory. You've got this.\n"

One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of telling yourself you'll do it in an hour, try setting a timer for just 10 or 15 minutes and commit to working during that time. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going. Also, consider creating a dedicated study space away from distractions like your bed or phone. It can help to associate that space with focus and productivity.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I totally get the Netflix/Reddit loop, it's a common trap. Here's what's worked for many students in your situation:\n\nFirst, get out of bed. Seriously. Your bed should only be for sleeping - when you try to study there, your brain gets confused about whether it's time to focus or relax. Find a dedicated study spot, even if it's just a corner of your room with a desk.\n\nThe \"in an hour\" promise is sneaky because it feels like you're being responsible, but it just delays the inevitable. Instead, try the \"5-minute rule\" - tell yourself you'll work for just 5 minutes. That's it. Usually once you actually start, you'll naturally want to continue. The hardest part is just beginning.\n\nFor alarms, they only work if there are consequences. Put your phone across the room when studying. Even better, use apps like Forest that \"plant\" virtual trees that die if you leave the app to check social media. It adds a small but effective mental barrier.\n\nStart small and build up. Don't try to reform your entire study routine overnight. Pick one subject or assignment, set a specific time (like right after school), and stick to it for a week. Small wins create momentum.\n\nRemember: procrastination isn't about laziness - it's about managing discomfort. The more you practice pushing through that initial resistance, the easier it gets. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the problem and asking for help. You've got this.",

Then, come back to your task and repeat the process. This is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can be a really effective way to build focus and momentum. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're procrastinating - are you feeling overwhelmed, bored, or anxious about your schoolwork? Once you understand what's driving your procrastination, you can start to develop strategies to address those underlying issues. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track.

Alarms can be tough because it's easy to just snooze them.\n\nInstead of focusing on huge blocks of work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Basically, you work in focused 25-minute intervals with short 5-minute breaks in between. After four \"pomodoros,\" you take a longer break (like 20-30 minutes). There are tons of free apps and websites that can help you time it. The short bursts of work can feel less overwhelming and make it easier to get started.\n\nAlso, try to identify *why* you're procrastinating. Is the work boring? Too hard? If it's boring, can you make it more interesting somehow (e.g., listen to music while you work, study with a friend)? If it's too hard, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.

Make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking breaks to prevent burnout. This will actually help you be more productive in the long run.\n\n2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break your big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This way, you can focus on making steady progress without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n3. **Schedule Downtime**: It's okay to relax and have fun. Schedule time for activities you enjoy, like hanging out with friends or playing games.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I want to challenge the premise that giving 100% every single day is actually sustainable or healthy. Even elite athletes have rest and recovery periods built into their training schedules. The key to long-term discipline isn't about maintaining maximum intensity 24/7, but rather about consistency and smart pacing.\n\nIt sounds like you're burning yourself out by trying to maintain an unsustainable pace between studying and boxing. When you crash and end up gaming or hanging with friends, that's your body and mind desperately seeking recovery time. Instead of viewing this as a failure of discipline, try building these breaks intentionally into your schedule.\n\nTry this approach: Plan your week with dedicated focus blocks for studying and training, but also schedule specific recovery periods. During those recovery times, you can guilt-free enjoy gaming or socializing, knowing it's part of your overall strategy rather than a lapse in discipline. This way you're working with your body's natural rhythms instead of fighting against them.\n\nThe most disciplined people aren't the ones who never rest - they're the ones who understand that strategic rest makes their focused work time more effective. Start viewing discipline as playing the long game rather than trying to sprint a marathon. Your goal should be maintaining consistent progress over months and years, not burning bright for a few weeks and then crashing.\n\nRemember: Discipline isn't about being perfect every day - it's about showing up consistently over time, even if some days are at 70% rather than 100%.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing your potential and wanting to push yourself to give 100% every day. First, it's essential to understand that it's okay to not feel 100% every day - it's normal to have off days due to lack of sleep or injury. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect. \n\nOne strategy you could try is to set realistic daily goals for yourself, taking into account how you're feeling physically and mentally. For example, if you're injured, maybe your goal for the day is to do some light stretching or watch instructional videos related to boxing instead of pushing through a tough workout. Similarly, if you're feeling exhausted from studying, maybe your goal is to review notes for a shorter period than usual.\n\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax, like spending time with friends or playing games. While it might seem counterintuitive, taking breaks and doing things you enjoy can actually help you recharge and come back to your goals with more focus and energy.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the concept of \"good enough.\" Some days, good enough might mean putting in 50% effort instead of 100%, but still making progress towards your goals. It's better to consistently make small strides than to burn out trying to be perfect every day. Remember, discipline is about consistency and patience, not about being flawless all the time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're pushing yourself really hard, which is admirable, but also a recipe for burnout if you're not careful.\n\nFirst, 100% every day isn't realistic or sustainable. Think of discipline more like a dimmer switch than an on/off one. Some days you'll be at 100%, others at 60%, and that's okay. The key is consistency over time, not perfection every single day.\n\nSecond, recovery is part of the process, not a break from it. Sleep isn't a luxury; it's essential for studying and training. The same goes for managing injuries. If you're injured, pushing through will only make it worse. Prioritize rest and rehab. Think of it as investing in your future performance.\n\nThird, those \"useless\" moments with friends or playing games? They might be more useful than you think. Downtime is crucial for mental health and preventing burnout. Schedule it in! Instead of feeling guilty about it, plan for it. Maybe allocate an hour or two on certain days to relax and recharge.\n\nFinally, when you find yourself drifting towards distractions, try to identify the trigger. Are you bored? Stressed? Tired? Once you know the trigger, you can develop a strategy to deal with it. Maybe it's a quick walk, a healthy snack, or a short meditation session.\n\nYou're already dedicated and committed, now it's about being smart about how you channel that energy. Good luck!\n"

While it's currently working for you, developing strategies to handle tedious work without chemical assistance could make you more adaptable long-term. Maybe try experimenting with other focusing techniques like the Pomodoro method or task batching for those boring tasks.\n\nConsider tracking your productivity and goal progress with and without weed for a few weeks.

Set a timer for 15 minutes and try to focus on one task (reading, studying, etc). No phone, no distractions. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the task. It's like building a muscle - you have to start where you are and slowly work up.\n\nAfter a week, bump it to 20 minutes. Then 25, then 30. The Pomodoro Technique (25 min work/5 min break) is a great target to work toward.\n\nReplace TikTok time with activities that build sustained attention: reading physical books, doing puzzles, or practicing a skill related to your passion. Even simple things like taking a shower without your phone or eating a meal without screens help retrain your brain for longer focus periods.\n\nThe first few days will feel uncomfortable - that's normal and temporary.

And also I’m in the process of learning how to cook for myself more because sometimes my mom is really busy. Also I picked up some fruit today & I just wanna thank everyone for all the helpful advice and have a great week!",

        "best_comment": "IMHO, the best investment a 16 year old can make is to learn cooking, you'll semi-automatically eat more fresh food. There's no unnecessarily complicated calorie counting, or reading food labels, or whatever fad-diet rules. You simply buy fresh veggies, fruits, nuts, etc. cook it, eat it. \n\nAs a side effect, you'll save money, spend it to learn other skills, or even invest them. When you're young, time is your best friend, so play the long game.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey! It's awesome that you're taking steps to clean up your diet and build better habits. Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Gradual Changes**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try reducing your intake gradually. This can make the transition easier and more sustainable.\n\n2. **Healthy Swaps**: Since you're plant-based, there are tons of delicious alternatives to junk food. Try swapping your protein cookie for a homemade energy ball or a piece of fruit with nut butter. For chips, roasted chickpeas or kale chips can be a crunchy alternative.\n\n3. **Meal Prep**: Learning to cook is a great skill, and meal prepping can save you time and help you avoid reaching for junk food. Start with simple recipes and gradually build your skills.\n\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to when and why you reach for junk food. Sometimes it's out of habit or boredom. Being mindful can help you make more conscious choices.\n\n5. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes cravings can be confused with thirst. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right track by exercising and making these changes. Keep it up, and good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Great job recognizing this habit and wanting to make a change! Since you're already exercising regularly, cleaning up your diet is a natural next step. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, which rarely works with sugar, try gradually replacing your current snacks with healthier alternatives. For example, when you're craving something sweet, reach for dates, berries, or a banana with nut butter. These will satisfy your sweet tooth while providing actual nutrients.\n\nSince you're plant-based, you might want to try making your own protein snacks. There are tons of recipes online for homemade protein balls using dates, nuts, and plant protein powder. They can be just as satisfying as those store-bought cookies but without all the processed ingredients.\n\nThe key is to make small, sustainable changes. Maybe start by replacing just one processed snack per day with a whole food alternative. Once that feels normal, tackle another. Keep healthy snacks readily available and visible - it's much easier to make good choices when they're right in front of you.\n\nAlso, drinking more water throughout the day can help reduce cravings. Sometimes what we interpret as a sugar craving is actually thirst. Keep a water bottle with you and stay hydrated.\n\nRemember that slip-ups are normal when changing any habit. Don't beat yourself up if you have a day where you eat more junk food than planned - just get back on track the next day. You've already shown great discipline with your exercise routine, and you can absolutely apply that same dedication to improving your diet.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing the need to cut back on high sugar and processed foods, especially given your regular exercise routine. Since you're plant-based, exploring healthy alternatives like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits can be a good starting point to curb your junk food cravings. Considering you've just started learning how to cook for yourself, try simple recipes that incorporate these ingredients. For instance, you could make your own energy balls using oats, nuts, and dried fruits as a healthier substitute for store-bought protein cookies. Also, having a bowl of fruit at home can be a great reminder to reach for something natural when you feel like snacking. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection - start by replacing one unhealthy snack with a healthier option each day and see how that goes. Keep in mind that developing self-discipline is a process, and it sounds like you're on the right track by acknowledging its importance and taking small steps towards cooking more for yourself. Good luck on your journey to cleaner eating!",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey! It's awesome you're tackling this at 16 – that's seriously proactive. Cutting back on sugar and processed foods is a great goal. Since you're plant-based, focusing on whole foods will be your best bet.\n\nInstead of going cold turkey (which can be tough), try swapping out those Lenny & Larry's cookies, candy, and chips gradually. Maybe replace the cookie with a piece of fruit and a handful of nuts. For the chips, try making your own baked sweet potato chips or air-popped popcorn. Small changes add up!\n\nSince you're already exercising, that's a huge plus. Maybe try to link your workouts to your food goals. Like, \"I'm going to crush this workout so I can fuel my body with something healthy afterward.\"\n\nAlso, since you mentioned your mom is busy, learning to cook some simple plant-based meals will give you a lot more control over what you're eating. There are tons of easy recipes online. Even just mastering a simple stir-fry or lentil soup can make a big difference.\n\nDon't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You got this!\n"

      "body": "I was asked to leave my job last year Nov 2020 due to inconsistent performance at the job because I'd fall asleep in the day during winters. I thought it was due to a sudden change from Nightshift job to Dayshift job (Both WFH). Summers went well, I somewhat made a routine, followed it, not completely disciplined but I at least saw some difference in myself.\n\nNow winters are back and it's been a month I have been messing up again. I am back to night shift job but I delay my work I don't know why. I feel very cold and get in the blankets, if I wear 2-3 layers of clothing I feel irritated and itching on the head, cheeks and back.\n\nPlease help me with this. Appreciate every small and big help.  \nAlso, Merry Xmas and HNY to everyone.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "There are a few things you can do.\n\nFirst, what's the ambient temperature of your house? I'm not asking what it says on the thermostat, but instead what it actually is inside the house. You may consider raising the temperature a little.\n\nSecond, light is important. People design their offices for low energy and for being sleepy. Put in 100 watt natural daylight LED bulbs in your office space. You should have 2 or 3 of them. Turn up your monitor brightness. You might even consider putting your lights on a timer. I have the lights in my bedroom come on automatically right after 7:00. Again, I am using natural daylight hue and I have the brightest LED panel fixture I could get. When the lights come on, it's a bright sunny day. The light helps you to wake up.\n\nThird, make sure you are getting decent sleep. You need to eat your meals and go to bed then get up at a consistent time every day - even the weekends. You want to aim for 8 hours.\n\nThere are a few other things.  A light, protein and fiber heavy meal first thing in the morning with a bit of coffee will really get you going. I'm talking 200 calories or less - something like a hardboiled egg, a protein bar, some lunchmeat, something like that. Absolutely no sugar or carbs though unless you want to have a blood sugar crash later.\n\nIt sounds to me also like you are having some dry skin issues. After showering, I would recommend slapping on some moisturizer. Use something water based. Apply daily everywhere, then to the exposed surfaces a few more times through the day, and to your hands after each time you wash them.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "In addition to the temperature and lighting mentioned by other posters, consider taking vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency can make you tired and is usually worse during the winter. \n\nI'd also recommend getting checked for basic vitamin levels and thyroid etc by your doctor because your fatigue seems to be impacting your daily life. They can give you more specific recommendations and make sure you don't go overboard.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a tough combo of winter blues and a challenging work schedule. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Light Exposure**: Try to get as much natural light as possible during the day. If that's tough, consider a light therapy lamp. It can help regulate your sleep cycle and boost your mood.\n\n2. **Layer Smartly**: Instead of piling on heavy clothes, try thermal layers that are designed to keep you warm without the bulk. Also, consider using a space heater to keep your workspace cozy without needing to bundle up too much.\n\n3. **Movement Breaks**: Set a timer to remind yourself to get up and move every hour. Even a quick stretch or a short walk around your home can help keep you alert.\n\n4. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Sometimes feeling sluggish can be linked to dehydration or not eating enough. Make sure you're drinking water and eating balanced meals.\n\n5. **Routine Adjustments**: Since you're back on night shifts, try to create a consistent routine that aligns with your work hours. This might mean adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you're getting enough rest.\n\nRemember, small changes can make a big difference. Good luck, and happy holidays!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - this sounds really challenging, especially since it's affected your work performance in the past. The good news is that winter sleepiness is pretty common and there are several practical ways to combat it.\n\nFirst, for the physical discomfort: Instead of piling on multiple layers that make you itchy, try getting a single high-quality thermal base layer (like merino wool which is non-itchy) and one warm outer layer. This will keep you warm without the bulk and irritation.\n\nFor fighting daytime sleepiness, environment makes a huge difference. Keep your workspace well-lit - consider getting a SAD lamp that mimics sunlight. They're especially helpful during winter months. Also, try to work in a cooler room (around 65-68°F/18-20°C) - being too warm makes sleepiness worse.\n\nMovement is key. Set an alarm every hour to get up and do some quick exercises - jumping jacks, stretches, or even just walking around for 2-3 minutes. This helps wake up your body and mind.\n\nSince you're on night shift, make sure you're keeping a consistent sleep schedule even on days off. Your body needs that routine. Also, try taking a Vitamin D supplement (after checking with your doctor) since you're probably getting less sunlight exposure.\n\nStart small - pick just one or two of these suggestions to implement first. Maybe begin with the movement breaks and consistent sleep schedule. Once those become habit, add another change. Small, consistent steps are more sustainable than trying to change everything at once.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a combination of factors that are making it tough for you to stay on track during winters. First, let's tackle the physical discomfort - have you considered using a humidifier to reduce dryness in the air, which might be contributing to the itching sensation? Additionally, you could try layering up with breathable fabrics like cotton or merino wool, which might be less irritating than synthetic materials.\n\nIn terms of staying awake and focused during the day, establishing a consistent routine can really help. Since you've had some success with this in the past, try to build on that momentum. Set specific times for waking up, working, and taking breaks, and stick to them as much as possible. It might also be helpful to get some morning sunlight exposure, even if it's just for a few minutes - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms.\n\nGiven your history of falling asleep during the day, it might be worth exploring ways to stay active and engaged during your waking hours. This could be as simple as taking a short walk outside, doing some light stretching, or practicing some mindfulness exercises. Finally, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day - this can help you build momentum and stay motivated, even when the winter blues are getting you down. Remember that it's okay to start small and work your way up - every little bit counts, and it's great that you're reaching out for support.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds really frustrating, especially after making progress in the summer. It's tough when seasonal changes throw a wrench in things.\n\nA couple of thoughts: First, the cold and the clothing irritation sound like they need addressing directly. Maybe experiment with different fabrics (merino wool is often recommended for warmth without itchiness) or try a heated blanket/pad just for your workspace to keep you warm without needing layers. Addressing the physical discomfort might make a bigger difference than you think.\n\nSecond, regarding delaying work, even though you're back on night shift, your body might still be adjusting to the winter daylight hours. Try to get some bright light exposure early in your shift (or even before, if possible). A SAD lamp could be helpful. Also, break down your work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking \"I have to do this huge project,\" think \"I'll just work on this one small task for 25 minutes.\" The Pomodoro Technique can be really useful for that.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to slip up, especially with seasonal changes. Just acknowledge it, figure out what triggered it, and get back on track. Don't let a few bad days turn into a bad month. Good luck, you got this!\n"

      "body": "This is my first post on here.\n\nBackground - I am in the final year of my undergraduate BA degree. I have always been a consistent student in all my previous semesters. Handed my assignments and term papers on time, Got mostly A's and sometimes B's, Managed to maintain an above average CGPA of 8.5 and above.\n\nSituation right now - I have submitted all my assignments and papers for my final semester, except for a 10,000 word thesis which is due in 2 days. This was initially supposed to be submitted in May, but I got an extension as I could not submit it at the time. My grandmother, my parents and sister all got covid, and given everything that has been happening, I couldn't focus on any of my academic submissions. The quality of my submissions has also gone down, as I am aware. \nIn the previous semester, I had also managed to submit my final papers a few weeks after I had a surgery and got A's in all of them, but I just haven't been able to do anything this semester.\nThis is probably the last extension I have gotten, and even now, I was not able to work at all. Neither did I have the motivation to, nor the willpower. I have also been having suicidal thoughts since the last 6 months, and I know that I am not okay.\n\nYesterday, I saw a lot my batchmates post on social media about their online graduation and that they finished their degree and I have been anxious ever since about failing now.\nOur college won't provide the option of taking a break year and continuing, nor will I have support from my family, so I have to finish this, no matter what. After being so close, I don't want to give up, but don't know what to do because of my mental health.\n\nThesis work done: I have written around 4,000 words, done 80% of my research. I have 2 chapters left to write, and then editing and proofreading them.\n\nAny advice, motivation or even personal experiences with similar University situations are welcome.\nI know that everyone is going through a very difficult time right now, and I am probably in a much better environment compared to that.\n\nThank you so much!",

The fact is, and this is the most important part…you just have to sit down and do it. \n\nYou can do this. \n\nThe stress of not having it done, and not working on it while the clock is ticking away is causing you more distress. Honest fact. I have faith that you can do this. \n\nSit down. Break up the next 48 hours into 12 chunks. In each chunk, write 500 words. Set a timer. When 500 is done, take a break, take a walk, stare at a wall. Whatever it takes. \n\nPut away phones and other distractions. Set yourself up and commit to writing the first 500 word chunk.

This is the final assignment and the fear and anxiety of this all being finished and real life after school starting had delayed you this far and because you sound like you're not used to last second work you're dealing with further delayism.\n\nOnly answer here is. Doing several back to back distraction free working sessions. With small breaks in between. Your Research is mostly done these focus work sessions will just put it all together. \n\nIt's not going to do it itself. Reddit cannot give you motivation.

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but you've already done a lot of the heavy lifting with your thesis. Here’s a plan that might help you push through these last few days:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: You’ve got 6,000 words to go. Try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Maybe aim for 1,000 words at a time. It’s less daunting and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each section.\n\n2. **Set a Schedule**: Allocate specific blocks of time for writing, and stick to them. Use a timer to focus for 25-30 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This is known as the Pomodoro Technique and can help maintain your focus and energy.\n\n3. **Prioritize**: Focus on getting the main content down first. You can refine and edit later. It’s more important to have a complete draft than a perfect one at this stage.\n\n4. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to your advisor or a professor. They might offer guidance or even a bit of leniency if they understand your situation.\n\n5. **Self-Care**: Remember to take care of yourself. Short walks, deep breathing, or even a quick chat with a friend can help clear your mind and reduce anxiety.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: Given your mention of suicidal thoughts, it’s crucial to reach out to a mental health professional. Many universities offer counseling services, and there are hotlines available that can provide immediate support.\n\nYou’re so close to the finish line. Just take it one step at a time, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help. You’ve got this!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, you're not alone in this situation - thesis deadlines and family health crises are incredibly tough, especially combined. But let's focus on what's doable in these next few days.\n\nYou've actually completed a significant chunk already - 4000 words and 80% of research is a solid foundation. The remaining 6000 words across 2 chapters is absolutely achievable in 2-3 days, even if it's not your best work ever. Remember, done is better than perfect right now.\n\nHere's a concrete plan: Break down the remaining work into 6 blocks of 1000 words each. That's roughly 3-4 hours per block if you include basic editing. Set up a distraction-free workspace and use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused writing followed by 5-minute breaks.\n\nStart with outlining your remaining chapters in detail. Then tackle one 1000-word block at a time. Don't edit while writing - just get the words down first. Leave the final day for editing and proofreading everything.\n\nRegarding your mental health - please reach out to your university's counseling services right after submitting this thesis. They often have emergency appointments available. You've shown incredible resilience handling surgery and family illness while studying - you can get through this too.\n\nFor immediate motivation: You're literally days away from completing your degree. Your track record shows you're more than capable of this - you've maintained an 8.5 CGPA and handled tough situations before. This is your final push.\n\nTake it one block at a time. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "Given your situation, it's crucial to break down the remaining work into manageable chunks. With 2 days left and 6,000 words to go, plus editing and proofreading, it's tight but not impossible. Focus on completing one chapter at a time, and don't worry too much about perfection at this stage - you can refine later. \n\nSince you've mentioned having suicidal thoughts, please ensure you're reaching out for support. Your university might have resources like counseling services that can offer immediate help, even if it's just a conversation to get through the next couple of days. It's okay to not be okay, and acknowledging this is a huge step.\n\nYour past achievements show you're capable of pushing through difficult times, like after your surgery. While this semester has been uniquely challenging, drawing on that resilience can help. Remember, it's not about being motivated or having willpower right now; it's about taking it one step at a time. \n\nLastly, try to limit your social media use for the next 48 hours to reduce anxiety triggers. You've got this far, and finishing this thesis, even if it's not perfect, is achievable. Once you're through this, prioritize getting help for your mental health - you don't have to go through this alone.",

First off, it's great that you've already written 4,000 words and done 80% of the research – that's a solid foundation to build on.\n\nGiven the time crunch, let's focus on getting this done. Forget about perfection right now. Aim for \"good enough\" to pass. Break down those remaining two chapters into smaller, manageable chunks. Think in terms of 500-word mini-goals. Can you knock out one of those every few hours?\n\nPrioritize sleep and food. Seriously. Pulling all-nighters fueled by caffeine will likely backfire. Even a short nap can do wonders.\n\nSince you're struggling with motivation, try the \"5-minute rule.\" Tell yourself you'll work on the thesis for just 5 minutes. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to lean on resources. Can you email your professor and briefly explain the situation? Even if they can't grant another extension, they might offer some guidance on prioritizing what needs to be done.\n\nMost importantly, please reach out for help regarding the suicidal thoughts. Your university likely has counseling services, and there are also resources like the Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Your mental health is paramount, and getting support is crucial. You've overcome challenges before, and you can get through this too. Focus on one small step at a time, and remember that finishing this thesis is within your reach. Good luck!\n"

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - what you're describing is a really common cycle with anxiety and avoidance. The more we avoid something, the scarier it becomes, which makes us avoid it more. But there are ways to break this pattern.\n\nStart incredibly small. Instead of thinking \"I need to catch up on all my classes,\" pick ONE tiny task. Maybe it's just opening your textbook for 5 minutes, or reviewing one lecture slide. The key is making it so small that it feels almost ridiculous to not do it.\n\nFor dealing with the anxiety itself, try the \"5-4-3-2-1\" grounding technique when you're feeling overwhelmed: Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring you back to the present moment when anxiety is spiraling.\n\nAlso, consider talking to your professors or academic advisor. Many students are dealing with similar struggles, and there might be resources or accommodations available to help you get back on track. You don't have to figure this out alone.\n\nRemember that avoiding tasks doesn't make them go away - it just adds the weight of guilt and anxiety on top of the original task.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're caught in a vicious cycle of anxiety and avoidance, which is really common when we're facing stressful situations like poor grades despite our best efforts. One strategy that might help is to break down the tasks or situations that are causing you anxiety into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of thinking \"I need to get my college grades back on track,\" try focusing on a single assignment or task that you've been putting off, and make a plan to tackle it in a specific, limited timeframe. This can help make the task feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, consider setting aside dedicated time to worry about your grades and college academics - this might sound counterintuitive, but giving yourself permission to worry for a set amount of time each day (say, 10-15 minutes) can actually help you feel more in control and able to focus on other things during the rest of the day.

Then, when those thoughts pop up at other times, you can tell yourself, \"I'll think about that during my worry time later.\" It sounds weird, but it can help contain the anxiety.\n\nFinally, and this is important, consider talking to your college's counseling services. They're there to help students with exactly these kinds of issues. They can offer strategies and support tailored to your specific situation. You're not alone in this, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Good luck, you got this!\n"

Schedule out your work for the day at the beginning of the day. Make sure your husband knows that you're \"at work\" during these times.\n\nTry a standing desk - I get lethargic sitting all day. Find a type of music that focuses you. Get solid sleep, eat well, and drink water. If your mind refuses to focus, do some exercises for 5 minutes - it will increase blood flow and the brain can actually burn lactic acid for energy. Edit: the brain doesn't burn it, it actually triggers norepinephrine, which is a hormone that encourages focus, affects our stress response, improves memory, and relates some bodily functions that can become distractions (bathroom, hunger). So first, get moving. Format exercise, dancing to music while working, 5 quick crunches and push ups, anything. Reading this journal entry, lethargy shifts you to  essentially half-asleepness.\n\nTake stringent notes on what you're distracted by, then chill out and reflect on that list to find ways to intercept those distracted spirals, prevent the distractions in the first place, or set up some \"give and take\" to not go full cold turkey.\n\nUltimately you may need to see someone if it doesn't improve.

        "gpt_comment": "Working from home can definitely be a challenge with all the distractions around. Here are a few strategies that might help you focus better. First, try setting up a dedicated workspace if you haven't already. Even a small corner can make a big difference in creating a mental boundary between work and home life. Communicate with your family about your work hours and the importance of minimizing interruptions during those times. You might also want to experiment with noise-cancelling headphones or background music to help drown out distractions. If the Pomodoro method isn't working as well as you'd like, consider adjusting the time intervals to see if longer or shorter periods work better for you. Lastly, don't forget to take breaks and give yourself some grace—working from home is a learning process, and it's okay to have off days. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!",
        "claude_comment": "Working from home with family around is definitely challenging! Here are some strategies that can help boost your concentration:\n\nFirst, try creating a dedicated workspace if possible - even if it's just a corner of a room. Put up a \"do not disturb\" sign when you're working and communicate with your husband about helping manage interruptions during your focus blocks.\n\nThe Pomodoro method is great, but 25 minutes might be too long with your current environment. Try starting with 15-minute focused sessions instead. As you build the habit, you can gradually increase the duration. The key is to make it achievable.\n\nFor the cat, consider having a designated cat bed or perch near your workspace. This can help satisfy their need for proximity while minimizing disruptions. Keep some treats handy to reward them for calm behavior.\n\nRegarding food distractions, prep your snacks/drinks before starting work and keep them at your workspace. This eliminates the need to visit the kitchen during focus time.\n\nYou might also benefit from noise-canceling headphones and using white noise or instrumental music to block out household sounds. Some people find that having a \"work playlist\" helps signal to their brain that it's focus time.\n\nRemember that building concentration takes practice. Start small, be consistent, and your ability to focus will improve over time. Each small win counts!",
        "llama_comment": "Working from home can be tough with all the distractions. One thing that might help is to create a dedicated workspace that's only for work - this can help you get into a \"work mode\" mindset and signal to your family that you're not available during certain hours. You could also try communicating your work schedule and boundaries with your husband and kid, so they know when you're focusing and can't be interrupted. As for the pomodoro method, you might consider extending your focus sessions to 45 or 60 minutes, with longer breaks in between - sometimes it takes a bit of time to get into a flow state, and the shorter sessions might not be giving you enough time to concentrate. Additionally, try to eliminate or silence as many distractions as possible during your work sessions - turn off notifications on your phone, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and consider using noise-cancelling headphones or playing calming music to help you stay focused.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, working from home with all those distractions is definitely a challenge! The Pomodoro Technique is a good start, but maybe we can tweak it.\n\nFirst, can you carve out a dedicated workspace, even if it's just a corner? Make it clear to your family that when you're in that space, you're \"at work\" and shouldn't be disturbed unless it's important. Visual cues like a closed door or even headphones can help.\n\nSecond, think about when you're *most* productive. Can you schedule your most focused work for those times, maybe when the kiddo is napping or your husband is handling things?\n\nThird, for those 25-minute Pomodoro sessions, try to eliminate as many distractions as possible *before* you start. Put your phone on silent, have a snack and water ready, and let your family know you're unavailable. If you *do* get interrupted, gently redirect and immediately get back to your task. Don't let the interruption derail the whole session.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's not going to be perfect every time. Just keep practicing and adjusting your strategy until you find something that works for you. Good luck!\n"

During regular weeks, stick to your usual workout routine. But during exam weeks or heavy hospital rotations, scale down rather than stopping completely. Even 5-10 minutes of basic exercises (quick stretching, bodyweight exercises, or a short walk) can maintain the habit without taking away from your studies.\n\nThe key is to have different \"modes\" of exercise:\nRegular mode: Your normal home workouts\nBusy mode: Ultra-short sessions (5-10 min)\nRecovery mode: Light stretching or walking\n\nThis way, you're never fully \"breaking\" the streak - you're just adjusting the intensity based on your current demands. It's much easier to bounce back to regular workouts when you've kept even a minimal routine going.\n\nRemember that some movement is always better than none. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

This way, you'll be more likely to stick to it even on busy weeks. Additionally, try to schedule your workouts at the same time every day or week, so it becomes a non-negotiable part of your routine, just like studying or hospital shifts. It might also be helpful to identify specific times when you tend to fall off track, like during exam weeks, and plan ahead for those periods by finding shorter, more manageable workout routines that can fit into your study schedule.

And often, once you get started, you'll feel good enough to do more!\n\nAlso, think about *when* you're most likely to succeed. Is there a small window in your day, even on busy days, where you could reliably squeeze something in? Maybe it's before your first class, or during a lunch break.

Think about incorporating more movement throughout your day. Even small things like walking during phone calls, doing some stretching every hour, or taking the stairs can make a difference. Look up \"NEAT\" (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) for ideas.\n\nAs for filling your day productively, since money is tight, focus on free or low-cost options. Libraries are goldmines!

Think about what skills you'd *like* to have and see if there are online tutorials or free courses you can follow. Websites like Coursera and edX often have free audit options.\n\nReading is great, but if you hate sitting, try audiobooks while you're walking or doing chores. Maybe explore different genres or authors to reignite your interest.\n\nFinally, don't underestimate the power of small, consistent steps. Pick one or two things from these suggestions and focus on incorporating them into your routine. It's better to do a little bit consistently than to try to overhaul everything at once and burn out.

The key is to make the transition gradually rather than forcing yourself into a 5am schedule right away. Start by moving your bedtime 15-30 minutes earlier each week, and do the same with your wake-up time. This gives your body clock time to adjust naturally.\n\nSome practical tips that make early morning workouts easier: lay out your gym clothes the night before, prep your pre-workout snack/coffee, and keep your alarm across the room so you have to physically get up to turn it off. The first few minutes are always the hardest, but having everything ready to go removes decision fatigue when you're groggy.\n\nThe most important factor is actually your evening routine. You'll want to start winding down 1-2 hours before bed - dim the lights, avoid screens (or use blue light filters), and develop a consistent bedtime ritual. Your morning success is really set up the night before.\n\nGive yourself at least 3-4 weeks to fully adapt to the new schedule. The first week especially might feel rough, but your body will adjust if you stay consistent. And remember - you don't have to jump straight to 5am.

As for the gym, consider planning out your workouts the night before, laying out your clothes and packing your bag, so you can just grab and go in the morning.

I go for a 1h swim six times a week nowadays, but at the start I was barely managing 20 minutes and swimming less then 0,5 km. I swim 2,7km in 1 hour now. \nI'm also off anti-depressants now and I am in the best shape of my life (though I'm not done yet). \n\nMy advice? Start exercising now. Do whatever you can, and do as little or as much as you can.\n\nDon't feel like running? Walk.\n\nCan't walk much? Then walk for 5 minutes.\n\nDo crunches or push-ups at home. Can't do more than one? Then just do the one.\n\nWhatever you do and no matter how little you do, just do it, and do it everyday. This alone will make you feel better.\n\nDon't push yourself too hard, though. You will fail if you try to run marathons now. \nAim to run marathons in a couple of years. \nBe patient with yourself. \nBe kind to yourself.\n\nAnd if you can, seek professional help. Find a therapist. Practice mindfulness. And keep up hope.\n\nYou are in your late 20s. I am nearly 40 and I truly feel like my best years have just begun. \n\nYou have all the time to achieve whatever you set your mind to. Just as long as you don't give up and are patient with yourself. \n\nThere is no easy way. But there is a way, and it's yours. So go. \n\nGood luck and godspeed. I don't know you, but I believe in you and I'll be rooting for you.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It’s never too late to get back on track, and your past experience with running shows you have the potential to be active and fit again. Here’s a simple plan to get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of jumping back into half marathons, try short, manageable runs or even brisk walks. The key is consistency, not intensity. Aim for 10-15 minutes a day and gradually increase as you feel more comfortable.\n\n2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals. For example, aim to run a certain number of days a week or gradually increase your distance. Celebrate these small victories to keep motivated.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. You don’t need to overhaul your diet overnight. Start by incorporating more whole foods and reducing processed snacks. Keeping a food journal might help you identify patterns and triggers for overeating.\n\n4. **Address Anxiety and Depression**: It’s important to tackle these head-on. Consider speaking with a professional who can provide strategies to manage these feelings. Exercise can also be a great way to boost your mood and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Find a friend or join a community (online or offline) that shares similar goals. Having someone to check in with can make a big difference in staying disciplined.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You’ve got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - first off, your best years are definitely not behind you at 26. Many people don't even start getting seriously fit until their 30s or 40s. Your previous running experience is actually an advantage - your body remembers, and you can build back up.\n\nStart small. Really small. Instead of jumping straight back into running, begin with 10-15 minute walks. Once that becomes routine, gradually increase the duration and add light jogging intervals. The key is consistency over intensity right now.\n\nFor the diet and anxiety connection - this is super common. Rather than trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small change. Maybe swap one snack for something healthier, or try eating more slowly at one meal per day. Small wins build momentum.\n\nYou don't need extensive research or complex plans. The basics work: move more, eat less processed food, get decent sleep. There's a great app called \"Couch to 5K\" that can help ease you back into running gradually, if you want to return to that.\n\nRemember that fitness isn't linear. Everyone has setbacks. What matters is getting back up and trying again, even if it's just for 5 minutes today. You've done impressive things before, and you absolutely can do them again - just focus on one small step at a time.\n\nWant to start today? Go for a 10 minute walk. That's it. Tomorrow, do it again. Build from there. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to make a change. First, let's ditch the idea that your best years are behind you - 26 is still incredibly young, and many people achieve their fitness goals in their 30s, 40s, and beyond. As for getting started, instead of overwhelming yourself with research, try setting small, achievable goals for now. For example, start by taking short walks each day or doing a few push-ups/squats in the morning. This will help build momentum and confidence. \n\nFor diet, consider consulting a nutritionist or a doctor who can provide personalized advice, especially since you're dealing with anxiety and depression. They can help you develop a plan that suits your needs and lifestyle. Additionally, look into simple, sustainable changes like meal prepping, keeping a food diary, or using an app like MyFitnessPal to track your eating habits. \n\nRemember, it's not about finding the perfect plan or app, but about making progress and being consistent. You might also want to explore other forms of exercise that don't involve running, like swimming, cycling, or yoga, which can be lower-impact and easier on your joints. Lastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory, and use that motivation to keep moving forward. You got this, and it's never too late to start anew.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey man, I get it. It's easy to feel like you've lost momentum, but 26 is definitely not \"over the hill\"! You've got a solid foundation from your running days, so you're not starting from scratch.\n\nInstead of trying to jump back into half-marathon shape immediately, which can be super discouraging, try micro-goals. Seriously, think *tiny*. Like, \"walk for 10 minutes three times this week.\" That's it. No pressure to run, just get moving. Once you've nailed that, bump it up a little. The key is consistency, not intensity, at this stage.\n\nFor the diet side, instead of a complete overhaul, focus on one small change. Maybe it's swapping sugary drinks for water, or adding a serving of vegetables to one meal a day. Small wins build momentum and make bigger changes feel less daunting.\n\nRegarding the anxiety/depression and overeating, that's a tough cycle. Instead of immediately reaching for food, try to identify what triggers those feelings. Then, have a go-to alternative ready. Could be a quick walk, listening to music, or even just deep breathing exercises. It won't magically fix everything, but it can help break the immediate connection between feeling bad and overeating.\n\nForget the extensive research for now. Keep it simple, keep it small, and focus on building sustainable habits. You've got this!\n"

It's normal to have fluctuations in motivation and energy. If 3 hours feels overwhelming right now, it's totally okay to scale back a bit. Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. \n\nAlso, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one. It might also help to set specific goals for each session, so you have a clear purpose and can see progress over time.\n\nSince you mentioned that you don't feel the same immediate benefits from work as you do from the gym or eating healthy, try to find ways to make your work more rewarding. Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.\n\nLastly, it's worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn't, it might be why you're struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Starting with 3 hours and dropping to 1 isn't unusual at all - this happens to most people when building new work habits. The mental resistance you're experiencing is totally normal, especially since you mentioned not feeling particularly passionate about the business side of things.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: Start with just 25 minutes of focused work (one Pomodoro), followed by a 5-minute break. Do this twice a day at first. It's ridiculously easy, but that's the point - you want to build consistency before duration. Once this becomes effortless (probably after a week or two), add another session. Keep building gradually.\n\nThe gym analogy you made is really interesting - you're motivated there because you get immediate positive feedback. We can use this! Try breaking your work into smaller chunks where you can feel that same sense of completion. Set tiny goals that you can \"check off\" every 25 minutes, giving yourself that same hit of accomplishment you get from the gym.\n\nAlso, consider examining what type of work actually energizes you versus drains you. If the business itself feels like a constant drain, it might be worth exploring what aspects of work do give you that \"feel good\" sensation, even if it's just small parts of your current projects.\n\nRemember, those people working focused for 6 hours didn't start there - they built up to it. There's nothing wrong with you; you're just at the beginning of building this particular muscle. Start small, be consistent, and gradually level up.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling to find motivation and consistency with your work schedule, and that's totally normal. One approach you might consider is indeed starting smaller and gradually increasing your daily work time. Instead of aiming for 3 hours right off the bat, try committing to a manageable 30 minutes or 1 hour of focused work each day, and then gradually add more time as you build the habit. This can help make the task less daunting and allow you to develop a sense of momentum.\n\nIt's also worth exploring why you feel so differently about work compared to other activities like going to the gym or eating healthy. You mention that with those activities, you can see the benefits immediately and feel good afterwards. With work, it might be helpful to try to identify some more immediate rewards or benefits, even if they're not directly related to making money. For example, do you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing a task? Do you enjoy the process of learning new skills or solving problems?\n\nAs for whether you care enough about your business, that's a tough question to answer, but it might be worth reflecting on what specifically is driving your lack of motivation. Is it the type of work itself, or is it something else entirely? Are there ways you could make your work more engaging or meaningful to you? Remember that it's okay if your motivations and interests evolve over time, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it's totally normal to struggle with consistency, especially when you're first starting out. Don't beat yourself up about it!\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing burnout, which is common when you push too hard too fast. Lowering your work hours and gradually increasing them is a solid strategy. Think of it like building a muscle – you wouldn't start with the heaviest weight. Maybe start with 1-2 hours and add 15 minutes each day or every few days.\n\nAlso, the fact that you enjoy the gym and healthy eating more suggests you value the immediate feedback. Work often lacks that instant gratification. Try breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable tasks with clear, achievable goals. Completing those smaller tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum.\n\nFinally, it's worth exploring *why* you're working on this business. If you don't care about the outcome, it's going to be a constant uphill battle. Can you connect your work to something you *do* care about, even if it's indirectly? Or maybe this business isn't the right fit, and that's okay too. Good luck!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to shake things up and push past that comfort zone. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Set Clear, Specific Goals**: Instead of vague goals like \"I want to grow,\" try setting specific, measurable goals. For example, \"I want to learn a new skill, like coding, and complete an online course in three months.\" This gives you a clear target to aim for.\n\n2. **Break It Down**: Big goals can be overwhelming, so break them into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Discipline often comes from routine. Set aside specific times each day or week dedicated to working on your goals. Consistency is key.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community with similar interests. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and accountable.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. What's working? What's not? Be open to adjusting your approach if needed.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Don't wait until you've achieved the big goal to celebrate. Acknowledge and reward yourself for the small victories along the way.\n\nRemember, growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, so embrace the discomfort as a sign that you're moving in the right direction. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Overcoming complacency starts with recognizing that growth requires deliberate discomfort - you're already ahead by acknowledging this. The key is creating systems that push you forward rather than relying on motivation alone.\n\nStart by setting specific, measurable goals in different areas of your life. Instead of vague aims like \"get better at programming,\" try \"complete one new coding project each month\" or \"learn three new programming concepts weekly.\" This makes progress trackable and gives you clear targets to work toward.\n\nA practical approach is to schedule regular \"growth reviews\" - maybe every Sunday evening. During these sessions, evaluate what you accomplished that week, where you stayed in your comfort zone, and plan one specific way to challenge yourself in the coming week. This builds accountability and keeps growth at the forefront of your mind.\n\nTo consistently push boundaries, try the \"plus one\" method: whatever you're currently doing, add one small challenge. If you read one book monthly, aim for two. If you exercise twice weekly, add a third session. These incremental steps make getting out of your comfort zone more manageable while maintaining steady progress.\n\nRemember that growth isn't always about doing more - sometimes it's about doing different things or approaching familiar tasks in new ways. Mix up your routines, take on projects that scare you a little, and connect with people who inspire you to level up.\n\nThe antidote to procrastination is making the first step ridiculously small. Want to write a book? Start with one paragraph daily. Want to learn a language? Begin with five minutes of practice. These tiny commitments often naturally expand once you're in motion.\n\nYour awareness of complacency is the first step to defeating it. Now it's about creating consistent action through systems and gradual challenges rather than waiting for motivation to strike.",
        "llama_comment": "Overcoming complacency is a great goal to have, and it's awesome that you're recognizing the need for growth in multiple areas of your life. One strategy that might help is to set specific, challenging goals for yourself in different areas, like learning a new skill or taking on a new hobby. Break down these larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to help build momentum and make progress feel more tangible. It's also important to create an environment that encourages growth, whether that means surrounding yourself with people who inspire you, reading books or articles that challenge your perspectives, or seeking out new experiences that push you out of your comfort zone. \n\nAnother approach is to schedule regular \"check-ins\" with yourself, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly, to reflect on your progress and identify areas where you might be getting too comfortable. Ask yourself questions like \"What have I learned recently?\", \"What challenges am I avoiding?\", and \"What small step can I take today to move closer to my goals?\" By regularly assessing your progress and making intentional decisions about how you want to grow, you can start to build a sense of discipline and momentum that helps you overcome complacency. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you find it tough to get out of your comfort zone at first - it's a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Celebrate your small wins, and use those as motivation to keep pushing forward. What do you think is the first area you'd like to tackle, and what's one small step you could take this week to start making progress?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get that feeling of being stuck in a rut. It's tough when you know you want more but can't seem to break free. Here's a few things that have helped me:\n\nFirst, try breaking down those big \"goals and dreams\" into super small, manageable steps. Like, ridiculously small. If you want to learn a language, don't aim for fluency right away. Aim for learning 5 new words a day. The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no. Those small wins build momentum and make the bigger picture less daunting.\n\nSecond, actively seek out discomfort. Complacency thrives in comfort zones. Try something new every week, even if it's just a different route to work, a new genre of music, or striking up a conversation with a stranger. The more you expose yourself to the unfamiliar, the less scary it becomes.\n\nThird, find an accountability buddy. Tell someone your goals and ask them to check in on your progress. Knowing someone else is watching can be a powerful motivator.\n\nFinally, remember that growth isn't always linear. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're not making progress. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Good luck, you got this!\n"

This means a comfortable mattress, blackout curtains, and a cool room temperature. Sometimes small tweaks can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Consistent Wind-Down Routine**: You mentioned reading before bed, which is great. Try to keep your wind-down routine consistent every night to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n3. **Light Exposure**: In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. This can help reset your internal clock and make waking up easier. If natural light isn't an option, consider a light therapy lamp.\n\n4. **Alarm Variety**: Since Alarmy worked well for you, maybe try varying the types of puzzles or challenges it offers. This can keep your brain engaged and prevent you from getting too used to the same routine.\n\n5. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Incorporating a short mindfulness or meditation practice before bed can help improve sleep quality, making it easier to wake up.\n\nRemember, perfection isn't always necessary, and even a 70% success rate is a solid foundation.

For that final 30%, here are some additional strategies that could help:\n\nFirst, track the mornings when you don't wake up successfully. Look for patterns - is it happening more on certain days of the week? After particular activities the day before? This data can help you identify and address specific triggers.\n\nSince Alarmy worked well for you, consider combining it with a smart bulb or sunrise alarm clock. These gradually brighten your room before your alarm time, helping your body wake up more naturally. The light + puzzle combination can be really effective.\n\nAlso, while your sleep schedule is good, you might experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier. Sometimes we need a bit more sleep than we think, and that extra buffer can make morning wake-ups easier.\n\nOne last suggestion: create a small reward system for your first few minutes awake. Maybe it's a favorite podcast you only listen to during your morning routine, or a breakfast you really look forward to. Having something enjoyable right after waking can help train your brain to get up more willingly.\n\nKeep building on what's working - you're definitely on the right track with your current habits.

To help boost that 70% success rate to 100%, I'd suggest exploring a few additional tactics. Have you considered exposing yourself to natural light as soon as your alarm goes off? This can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make it easier to wake up. You could also try making your morning routine more enjoyable, such as listening to music or doing some light stretching - this might give you something to look forward to and make it easier to get out of bed. Additionally, you might want to experiment with a \"stop doing\" list, where you identify any habits or activities that might be sabotaging your sleep or making it harder to wake up, such as scrolling through your phone before bed or consuming heavy meals too close to bedtime. It's also worth considering whether there are any underlying issues, such as sleep quality or stress, that might be affecting your ability to wake up consistently. The Alarmy app seems like a great tool, so you might want to keep using that and see if you can combine it with some of these other strategies to get to 100%.",

Here are a few ideas to nudge you closer to 100%:\n\nFirst, since you're already using Alarmy and it worked well, maybe experiment with different puzzle types or difficulty levels within the app. Keep it challenging enough that you're actually awake when you solve it.\n\nSecond, consider *why* you're failing the other 30% of the time. Are you hitting snooze without realizing it? Are you genuinely still exhausted? If it's exhaustion, maybe slightly adjust your bedtime earlier, even by just 15 minutes. If it's the snooze button, try putting your phone and alarm clock even FURTHER away, like in a different room entirely. Make it a real chore to turn them off.\n\nThird, think about adding a reward system. If you wake up on time for a full week, treat yourself to something you enjoy (a special breakfast, a new book, etc.). Positive reinforcement can be surprisingly effective.\n\nFinally, and this might sound counterintuitive, but don't beat yourself up too much about the occasional slip-up. It happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Consistency is key, but perfection is the enemy of good. Good luck!\n"

They are living their own life for the last 13 years so really man, honesty is the best policy. Personally, I'd talk it over before exchanging any bodily fluids.\n\nWhen people have sex, it creates bonding, like literally just the hormones flood and bonding occurs. It's why the decent thing to do is really be upfront prior to sex and anything intimate and not a moment before copulation but like in a casual setting explain your situation honestly. It's terrifying but the right thing to do.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking for advice—acknowledging the problem is a huge step. Since AA didn't resonate with you, maybe try exploring other support groups or resources that don't have a religious component, like SMART Recovery. They focus on self-empowerment and use a science-based approach, which might align better with your beliefs.\n\nBuilding discipline is key, and it starts with small, manageable steps. Consider setting a daily goal, like reducing your alcohol intake gradually or replacing drinking with a healthier habit. Exercise can be a great outlet; it helps with stress and can improve your mood. Also, keep yourself busy with activities that you enjoy or that challenge you in a positive way.\n\nSince you mentioned being overworked, it might help to evaluate your work-life balance. Sometimes stress can be a trigger, so finding ways to manage it, like through meditation or hobbies, can be beneficial.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to lean on your support system. Your parents and employer are worried because they care, and having someone to talk to can make a big difference. And congrats on reconnecting with your college friend—having positive relationships can be a great motivator.\n\nStay strong, and remember, it's a journey. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - first off, major props for reaching out and being ready to make this change. That takes real courage.\n\nSince AA wasn't a fit for you, I'd strongly recommend checking out SMART Recovery. It's science-based, secular, and focuses on building practical skills to overcome addiction. They have both in-person and online meetings.\n\nFor the immediate term, you'll want to create physical distance between yourself and alcohol. Clear out your living space completely. No \"just in case\" bottles. Let trusted friends/family know you're quitting and ask them to help by not drinking around you for now.\n\nThe \"siren call\" you described is very real. Two things that can help combat this: First, play the tape forward - when you feel the urge, mentally walk through exactly how drinking will play out, including the inevitable hangover and regret. Second, have a concrete plan for what you'll do instead when cravings hit. Exercise, calling a friend, meditation - whatever healthy activity works for you.\n\nGiven your upcoming date, you might want to suggest meeting for coffee or another non-alcohol activity. Being upfront about making positive changes in your life can actually be attractive, and it removes the pressure of navigating drinking situations early in recovery.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about consistently making choices aligned with your goals, even after setbacks. You've got this, and there are lots of resources and people ready to support you on this journey.",
        "llama_comment": "Hey there, congratulations on taking the first step by acknowledging your struggle and seeking help. It's great that you've found this community, and I'm glad you're open to advice. Given your experience with AA didn't quite work out, let's focus on other strategies. Have you considered seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction? They can help you identify underlying issues contributing to your alcohol use and develop a personalized plan to overcome them. Additionally, you might find it helpful to keep yourself occupied with new hobbies or activities that bring you joy, making it easier to resist the temptation of alcohol. Since you mentioned being overworked, exploring ways to manage your workload or finding healthier coping mechanisms for stress could also be beneficial. It's also wonderful that you've reconnected with someone from your past - having a supportive social network can make a big difference in your journey. Remember, recovery is a process, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, but being willing to try different approaches and seek support is a huge step forward. Keep moving forward, and don't hesitate to reach out when you need guidance or just someone to talk to. ✌️",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, congrats on taking the first step and reaching out. It takes guts to admit you're ready for a change. Since AA wasn't your thing, let's think about some other strategies.\n\nFirst, that siren's call is powerful, so you need to build up your defenses. Think about what triggers your cravings. Is it stress from work? Boredom? Loneliness? Once you know your triggers, you can develop specific coping mechanisms. For example, if it's work stress, maybe try a quick meditation app or a short walk during your break. If it's boredom, find a new hobby or project to dive into.\n\nSecond, since you're reconnecting with someone, lean into that! Having a positive social connection can be a huge motivator. Maybe suggest a non-alcohol-related activity for your dinner date.\n\nThird, consider talking to a doctor about medical options. There are medications that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It's not a sign of weakness to need medical help; it's just smart.\n\nFinally, track your progress. Use a journal or an app to note your cravings, triggers, and how you coped. Seeing your progress, even small steps, can be really encouraging.\n\nIt's a tough road, but you've got this. One day at a time.\n"

Get lots of storage tubs and work on just keeping clothes sorted. Don’t worry about folding or hanging clothes- just keep them off the floor and in some kind of container. Do you have trash everywhere? Get a kitchen trash can so you can throw paper and trash away immediately. \n\nSet a recurring alarm on your phone so you remember to wash your clothes and sheets once a week if you need to. \n\nDon’t vacuum. Get a dust buster and spot clean in the middle of the night. Keep paper towels and windex on your bookshelf or in your closet so you can clean off surfaces when you catch a glimpse of the bottle. \n\nAre you procrastinating your boring  ass work?

Chemical dependencies aren’t great though, and tou don’t want to accidentally start going to drugs and alcohol every time you feel a bad emotion. I would suggest that at the very least, you journal your feelings and work on being self aware of your triggers and the feelings that make you want to comfort yourself with drinking and weed. \n\nYou *can* discipline yourself but I will tell you, it’s very very very hard to discipline yourself while also experiencing pain and grief and trauma. You need a break. You need time to stop carrying so much. You cannot expect to get better while beating yourself up and shaming yourself for not being perfect.",

Here are a few ideas that might help you get started on building some habits:\n\n1. Start small. Pick one tiny habit to focus on, like making your bed every morning or spending 5 minutes tidying up your room. Once that becomes a routine, you can gradually add more.\n\n2. Use timers. Set a timer for 10-15 minutes to work on a task. Knowing there's a set end time can make it easier to start, and you might find you want to keep going once you get into it.\n\n3. Create a simple daily routine. Having a basic structure can help you feel more in control. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something to guide your day.\n\n4. Celebrate small wins. Every little step forward is progress. Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, even if it's just a mental pat on the back.\n\n5. Consider accountability. Sometimes sharing your goals with a friend or online community can help keep you motivated.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

        "claude_comment": "First off, you've been through a lot in a short time. It's completely understandable that you're struggling right now, but it's great that you're looking to make positive changes.\n\nSince you mentioned ADHD and autism, let's start really small. Forget about all the big goals for now - working out, eating perfectly, etc. Instead, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Something ridiculously easy that takes less than 2 minutes. Maybe it's just putting one piece of trash in the bin each morning, or washing your face.\n\nThe key is to make it so simple you can't fail. Don't try to clean your whole room - just commit to picking up one thing daily. Don't worry about working out - just do one pushup or stretch for 30 seconds. The goal isn't the action itself, it's building the habit of showing up every day.\n\nOnce that tiny habit feels automatic (might take 2-3 weeks), add one more small thing. Maybe that's when you tackle the daily bathing. Break it down into steps if needed - just getting into the bathroom counts as a win at first.\n\nFor the ADHD specifically, external reminders are crucial. Put sticky notes where you'll see them, set phone alarms, or use habit tracking apps. Make it impossible to forget.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about motivation or willpower. It's about creating systems that work for your brain. Start incredibly small, be consistent, and gradually build up. You've got this - one tiny step at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It's amazing that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to make a change, especially after going through such a tough time with all the losses you've experienced. Given your ADHD and autism, it might be helpful to focus on creating systems and routines that work for you, rather than trying to rely solely on willpower or motivation. \n\nOne strategy could be to start incredibly small - like, tiny habits small. For example, instead of trying to clean your entire room, begin with making your bed every morning or putting away one item after use. This can help build momentum and a sense of accomplishment. It's also important to understand that it's okay to not be perfect and that discipline is not about being perfect, but about being consistent.\n\nGiven your concerns about smoking and drinking, you might consider setting specific, achievable goals related to these habits, like reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke per day or designating certain days as alcohol-free. \n\nExercise and healthier eating are great goals, but again, starting small is key. Maybe begin with short walks or a few push-ups each day, and try to replace one unhealthy meal with a healthier option. It's about progress, not perfection.\n\nLastly, while you mentioned that consulting help doesn't work for you in terms of discipline, it might still be beneficial to have someone to talk to about your feelings and struggles. Sometimes, just having someone who understands can make a big difference. Remember, building discipline is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and there are many resources available online, from habit-tracking apps to forums like this one, where people share their experiences and tips.

Losing your grandfather, his wife, and your girlfriend in such a short period is a lot to process. It's great that you recognize the need for change and want to build better habits.\n\nGiven the ADHD and autism, and the recent losses, maybe trying to overhaul everything at once isn't the best approach. Start *incredibly* small. Like, ridiculously small. Instead of \"work out,\" aim for \"do 5 push-ups\" or \"walk around the block.\" Instead of \"eat healthier,\" try \"eat one piece of fruit today.\" The goal is to build momentum and a sense of accomplishment, not to overwhelm yourself.\n\nFor the room, try the 5-minute rule. Set a timer for 5 minutes and just tidy up one small area. You might be surprised how much you can get done in that short time, and it's way less daunting than tackling the whole room at once.\n\nRegarding the smoking and drinking, maybe focus on reducing rather than quitting cold turkey. Try setting a limit for yourself each day and sticking to it.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. You've been through a lot. Celebrate the small wins, and don't beat yourself up for the setbacks. It's a process, not a race. Maybe look into ADHD-specific strategies for habit building, as they often involve visual cues, reminders, and breaking tasks down into even smaller steps.

I have $12000 saved up. I didn't save the next month, it doesn't put my savings back to $0.

Your pleasure seeking self has some control, your lazy self has some control, you all have some control together.\n\nIt's important to create feedback loops. There is a 100% chance that you won't get everything right on your first try. Therefore create mechanisms to constantly correct your plans. There are PDCA cycles, there is scrum, there is journaling. Choose whatever you like, but make sure it lets you create working feedback loops.\n\nAlso, don't use brute force. Find good enough reason for everything you do so you don't have to use force.\n\n3) If you set ambitious goals you won't make 100% of what you planned on most days. It's ok. Get used to not being perfect.\n\n>I guess I dont really have a \"why\" for all this nor an end goal, all I know is that I just want to be better and improve what I can\n\nYou need to rectify this, because if you don't know where you are going you won't get there.

Planning is good, but too much planning can become procrastination. The key is to make your initial changes small enough that they feel almost too easy. Want to exercise? Start with 5 minutes daily. Want to read more? Begin with 2 pages per day.\n\nOn building discipline and sticking to habits: The most effective approach is to link new habits to existing ones (habit stacking) and make them ridiculously small at first. If you want to meditate, start with taking 3 deep breaths right after brushing your teeth. The smaller the habit, the easier it is for your brain to accept it as part of your routine.\n\nFor handling setbacks: Think of your routine like GPS navigation - when you miss a turn, it doesn't tell you to give up and go home. It just recalculates from where you are. If you miss a day, simply resume the next day. No guilt, no making up for lost time, just pick up where you left off.\n\nNot having a specific \"why\" isn't necessarily bad, but you might find it helpful to spend 10 minutes writing down what \"better\" looks like to you. Even if it's vague like \"more energy\" or \"feeling more in control,\" having something concrete can help guide your choices.\n\nRemember: consistency trumps intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to do something big sporadically. Start small, stay consistent, and let the momentum build naturally.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing the need for change and wanting to improve yourself - that's a huge step already. To answer your questions, I'd say it's often a good idea to start by planning out your goals and habits, but not to the point where you get stuck in analysis paralysis. Try to find a balance between planning and taking action. You could start by identifying one or two key habits you want to change or implement, and then create a rough plan for how you'll make that happen. \n\nAs for improving discipline and sticking to new habits, it's all about creating an environment that supports your goals and making small, incremental changes that add up over time. You might consider tracking your progress, finding accountability with a friend or community, and rewarding yourself for small wins along the way.\n\nOn days when you mess up, don't be too hard on yourself - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track as soon as possible. Remember that building new habits is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Instead of getting discouraged, try to focus on what you can learn from the experience and how you can improve moving forward.\n\nNot having a clear \"why\" or end goal isn't necessarily a bad thing - sometimes just knowing that you want to be better and improve is enough to get started. As you make progress and build new habits, you may find that your goals and motivations become clearer over time. One general tip I'd offer is to focus on building positive habits rather than trying to cut out negative ones. By adding more good habits to your routine, you'll naturally start to crowd out some of the bad ones. Keep in mind that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things until you find what works for you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it's awesome that you're recognizing your potential and wanting to make a change! It's a great first step.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1.  **Easing in vs. Brute Force:** Most people find more success with easing in. \"Brute force\" can lead to burnout. Start with ONE habit. Nail it down. Then add another. Think small, achievable wins. For example, instead of \"workout every day,\" start with \"walk for 20 minutes three times a week.\"\n\n2.  **Improving Discipline and Sticking to Habits:** A few things here. First, make your habits ridiculously easy to start. James Clear calls this the \"Two-Minute Rule\" in *Atomic Habits*. If you want to read more, I highly recommend that book. Second, track your progress. Even just a simple checkmark on a calendar can be super motivating. Third, build in accountability. Tell a friend about your goals, or find an online community.\n\n3.  **Messing Up:** Everyone messes up! Don't beat yourself up about it. The key is to get back on track as quickly as possible. If you miss a day, don't let it turn into two. Just acknowledge it, learn from it (what tripped you up?), and get back to it the next day. Don't let a slip-up derail your entire effort.\n\nSince you mentioned not having a \"why\" or end goal, maybe spend some time reflecting on your values. What's truly important to you? What kind of person do you want to be? Connecting your habits to your values can provide a powerful source of motivation. Even just journaling for 10 minutes a day can help you figure this out. Good luck, you got this!\n"

        "best_comment": "As someone with ADHD+Anxiety, also past substance abuser, this is hella relatable. Not saying you have ADHD or Anxiety just that this is like default operating mode with ADHD and sometimes anxiety, also similar to the patterns in being addicted to something.\n\nProblem is, you probably do know how to change your mind and start doing these things, it’s just that some base level networking in your brain is telling you ‘that will take too long to feel good, so do THIS which will make you feel good right now’ and you’re LETTING it run your life, at least for now. \n\nIt’s not like you’re gonna wake up tomorrow and change it all, but based on a pretty simplified understanding of how brains work; the more you do one thing, the more your brain gets wired to do it. So just start small, be willing to FORGIVE yourself when you fuck up, and remember that it takes time to accomplish any goal. It wouldn’t be a ‘goal’ if you could just do it right now and be done with it. \n\nBased on that, the best course of action IMO is to accept “yes I’m addicted to shit I don’t like, and I want it to change, but it’s not gonna happen overnight, so I’ll start small”. So if you’re 100% stuck doing the things you don’t like today, tomorrow try and force yourself to do 5% of the things you want to do, and accept that you’ll probably do 95% tiktok and time wasting. Then work towards 10%. Then 20%, and so on and so forth. Overtime, you’ll start building some fucking discipline and drag yourself out of the dopamine seeking hellhole that it sounds like your living in. \n\nIt’s great to aim high over the long term, and maybe you will get there, but for the short term, lower your expectations, and aim for mediocrity, then once you’ve gotten there, start aiming a bit higher each time, just slowly increasing your ability to sustain motivation, determination, and focus at a pace that is OK FOR YOU! Everyone is different, so don’t worry about how long it takes you, just take things one day at a time, or even one hour at a time, and chip away at using video games and tik tok slowly. Just remember those things have no ‘tangible gains’ they are all just fleeting moments of distraction and contentment, just temporary distractions from feelings of unhappiness and lack of content with life. \n\nWhen I wanted to turn off the world around me, I would get high, turn to the bottle, blast the music, just to temporarily feel good so I could ignore alll the things that made me feel bad. It’s been nearly 4 years since then, and I still have shitty coping mechanisms to ignore the things I’m not working on and know I need to be, but overtime I’m getting better at it, and maybe somewhat closer to letting any joy in life slip entirely through my fingers.",

One thing that might help is breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of focusing on the big picture, try to identify the very first, smallest action you can take. For example, if you want to start a new project, maybe the first step is just opening a document and writing a title. \n\nAlso, try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes to work on something. Often, just getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, it becomes easier to keep going. \n\nAnother tip is to create a routine or schedule that includes time for both work and play. This way, you can enjoy your downtime guilt-free, knowing you've already made progress on your goals. \n\nLastly, consider limiting distractions by setting specific times for TikTok or gaming, so they become rewards rather than default activities. Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, and every small step counts. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - what you're describing is super common, especially with how addictive things like TikTok and games are designed to be. The good news is you can absolutely turn this around, starting with small steps.\n\nFirst, make things as easy as possible to start. Instead of thinking about your big dreams and getting overwhelmed, pick ONE tiny thing you want to do tomorrow. Something that takes 5 minutes or less. Maybe it's reading one page of a book, doing 5 pushups, or writing three sentences. The key is making it so small it feels almost ridiculous to not do it.\n\nNext, put your phone in another room when you want to get that small task done. Don't rely on willpower - just remove the temptation entirely. You can get back to TikTok after, but give yourself those few minutes of focused time first.\n\nAs you build confidence with tiny wins, gradually increase what you take on. The most important thing is consistency over intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to burn yourself out trying to change everything at once.\n\nYour brain is currently wired for instant gratification from social media and games. That's okay - you just need to slowly rewire it by proving to yourself you can follow through on small commitments. Each time you do, you'll build momentum and start feeling more capable of tackling bigger goals.\n\nStart today with choosing that one tiny action for tomorrow. What's it going to be?",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a common obstacle - the gap between intention and action. One strategy that might help is to break down your goals into ridiculously small, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking \"I want to achieve X,\" try telling yourself \"I'll do Y for 10 minutes today.\" This can make the task less daunting and help you build momentum. For example, if you want to start writing a book, your initial goal could be as simple as opening a document and typing a single sentence. Additionally, consider implementing a \"2-minute rule\" - if a task can be done in less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This can help you build the habit of taking action without getting bogged down by procrastination. It's also important to identify your why - what's driving your desire to make these changes? What will achieving your goals mean for your life and happiness? Reminding yourself of your underlying motivations can help you stay focused and motivated. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you get distracted - it's a normal part of the process. Just acknowledge the setback and gently refocus your attention on your goal. You're not alone in this struggle, and small steps can add up over time to make a big difference.",

The point isn't the sentence or the push-up itself, it's building the habit of *starting*.\n\nOnce you've done that tiny thing, you might find it easier to do a little more. And if you don't, that's okay too! You still accomplished your goal for the day. Also, try to identify the specific triggers that lead you to TikTok or video games. Is it a certain time of day? A certain feeling? Once you know the triggers, you can try to replace those habits with something slightly more productive, or at least less draining. Good luck, you got this!\n"

Got less than average grades. Couldn't get accepted in a good college. And had to study for my first year of college by MYSELF and give exams as an individual privately, which is an option for failures like me. I don't know how to say it but it felt like a fuse just lit up in me and i was fucking studying hard. Turns out, that was my best performance ever. I had the best possible grade in all of my first year college exams studying by myself. Immediately, after that i got into a college for my second year with a full scholarship. But, i had lost my winning mentality and couldnt zone in on it. I had basically zoned out of it and possibly permanently. Got above average grades but i know that i performed no way near my first year. Finished college with very respectable grades (mainly because of my lion mentality in my first year). \n\nAnd since then, ive only ever felt that druve and mentality once for my uni exams.

It's easy to say you can't help it, or that you can't control it, but at the end of the day, you can. You just haven't been able to.  \n\n\nAlso, if you don't believe you can keep it consistent, then you won't be able to. Whatever you believe will be what ends up happening.  \n\n\nSo, the first thing you should do about this is to hold yourself accountable. It is your fault you can't stay consistent and you just need to do better in the future.  \n\n\nNow, after that, once you recognize you have full control over your own actions, then it's time to think WHY it is that you're feeling such a strong resistance. Is your life lacking balance? Are you having enough fun? Or are you just wearing yourself down?  \n\n\nCould this be a motivational thing? Maybe you're just not as intrinsically motivated to have the best performance possible academically. How much does that matter to you and why does it matter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving your WHY extremely clear will help you a lot.  \n\n\nAlso, you should try to analyze what were the factors that contributed to your epic performance in the past.

The key to maintaining a consistent \"winning mentality\" often lies in building habits and routines that support your goals, even when you're not feeling that initial spark.

This makes it easier to stay focused and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and self-care. Consistency in your daily habits can help maintain your focus and drive.\n\n3. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on what's working and what's not. Adjust your strategies as needed to keep moving forward.\n\n4. **Stay Accountable**: Share your goals with a friend or join a study group. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and on track.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

        "claude_comment": "That \"winning mentality\" you experienced wasn't random - it came from a genuine sense of urgency and necessity during your first year. When you had to study privately, failure wasn't an option, and that pressure created intense focus and drive.\n\nThe key is understanding that discipline doesn't rely on motivation or mentality - it's about building systems and habits that work regardless of how you feel. Instead of trying to recapture that specific mental state, focus on creating a consistent routine and environment that supports your goals.\n\nStart small. Set specific study times and stick to them even when you don't feel like it. Create a dedicated study space. Break down your work into manageable chunks. Use techniques like the Pomodoro method (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to maintain concentration.\n\nTrack your progress daily, even if it's just marking an X on a calendar for completing your planned study session.

First, let's acknowledge that it's great you've identified your \"winning mentality\" and have had successes with it, especially during your first year of college. \n\nOne potential strategy to help you tap into this mentality more consistently is to reflect on what triggered it in the past. Was it the feeling of being an underdog, having to study by yourself? Was it the pressure of needing to perform well for a scholarship? Identifying these triggers might help you recreate the conditions that led to your success.\n\nAnother approach could be to develop a pre-performance routine that signals to your brain that it's time to get into \"winning mode.\" This could be something as simple as a specific workout, a particular book or podcast, or even just a consistent morning routine. The idea is to create a mental association between these activities and your desired state of mind.\n\nIt might also be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks, and focus on building momentum through consistent progress rather than relying on bursts of motivation.

Try to establish a firm bedtime that allows for 7-8 hours.

The goal is to create a mental shift from \"doing mode\" to \"being mode.\"\n\nRemember that intimacy doesn't always have to be spontaneous or lengthy.

Prioritizing sleep, even by just an extra hour, can make a huge difference in your stress levels and overall energy. Maybe try setting a \"wind-down\" alarm an hour before bed to signal it's time to stop working and start relaxing.\n\nSecond, you mentioned always thinking about what you could be doing. That's a classic anxiety symptom, and it bleeds into your personal life. Have you considered incorporating mindfulness or meditation into your daily routine? Even 10 minutes a day can help you learn to quiet the mental chatter and be more present in the moment, which could help with arousal and connection with your wife. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you.\n\nThird, instead of thinking about completely giving up your goals, maybe try reframing them. Are they truly *your* goals, or are they driven by external pressures? Could you break them down into smaller, more manageable steps? This might make them feel less overwhelming and free up some mental space. Also, schedule in dedicated \"couple time\" just like you schedule in work tasks. Put it on the calendar and treat it as a non-negotiable appointment.\n\nFinally, and this is important, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage it more effectively, which will benefit all areas of your life, including your relationship.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you've been through a lot, but it's great that you're looking to get back on track. Here are a few ideas to help you make the most of your summer:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small daily or weekly goals. It could be as simple as reading a book, learning a new skill online, or getting back into a fitness routine. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Re-establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily schedule that includes time for exercise, hobbies, and relaxation. Having a routine can provide structure and help you stay focused.\n\n3. **Explore New Hobbies**: Use this time to explore interests you haven't had time for. Whether it's learning a new language, cooking, or picking up an instrument, it can be both fun and fulfilling.\n\n4. **Volunteer**: If jobs and internships are off the table, consider volunteering. It's a great way to gain experience, meet new people, and make a positive impact.\n\n5. **Reflect and Plan**: Take some time to reflect on what you've learned from the past few months and plan for the future. What do you want to achieve in the next year? How can you set yourself up for success?\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. What's important is that you're taking steps to move forward. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, props for recognizing that period wasn't great for you and wanting to make positive changes. That self-awareness is actually a really good starting point.\n\nThose 3-4 months at home can be a perfect reset opportunity. Since you mentioned having success with self-improvement earlier this year, you already know you're capable of it. The key is creating structure and positive momentum.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for your summer: Start with a simple morning routine - maybe 30 mins of exercise (doesn't have to be gym, could be running or bodyweight stuff), followed by 15 mins of planning your day. Pick up a skill that interests you and could be useful later - coding, a language, whatever catches your interest. Set aside specific hours for this daily.\n\nThe job/internship situation might be tricky timing-wise, but you could use this time to build your resume in other ways - maybe an online certification, personal project, or volunteering. This gives you something concrete to show for your summer while addressing that comparison mindset more productively.\n\nMost importantly, take it one day at a time. You don't need to figure out everything at once. Focus on building consistent, healthy habits first. When September rolls around, you'll be in a much better position to tackle university life with stronger foundations.\n\nRemember that setbacks don't define you - it's how you respond to them that matters. You've already taken the first step by wanting to change course. Now it's just about putting one foot in front of the other.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've been through a tough period, but recognizing the issues and wanting to make a change is a huge step forward. First, congratulations on stopping the behaviors that were holding you back, especially with the health scare - that can be a really wake-up call. Now, with 3-4 months ahead of you, this could be a great opportunity to refocus on your self-improvement journey. Since job hunting and internships might not be viable options right now, why not use this time to revisit your goals and priorities? You could start by setting small, achievable objectives for yourself, like getting back into a gym routine or picking up a new hobby. It's also important to address the underlying issues that led you astray in the first place, such as your inferiority complex - consider journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist to work through these feelings. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the past few months - everyone has setbacks, and it's how you learn from them that matters. Use this time to recharge, reflect, and come back stronger. What do you think is the first step you'll take to get back on track?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey man, it sounds like you went through a rough patch, but the good news is you're aware of it and want to get back on track. That's the first and biggest step.\n\nSince you have 3-4 months free, this is a great opportunity. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's getting back to the gym consistently. Or maybe it's exploring a new hobby that genuinely interests you, something that isn't tied to external validation.\n\nThink about *why* you fell off track. You mentioned feeling inferior and compulsively looking for a job. Address that underlying feeling. Maybe journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist could help you understand those feelings better.\n\nAs for the summer, consider learning a new skill online. There are tons of free or low-cost courses available. It's productive, engaging, and can boost your confidence. Also, think about volunteering. Helping others can be a great way to get out of your head and feel good about yourself.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about the past. Learn from it, and focus on building better habits one step at a time. You got this.\n"

But every day I just feel so physically and mentally tired.  \n\nI \"work\" 40 hours a week, or at least my company thinks i do, but in reality I probably spend 10-15 hours a week actually working.  The rest I spend sitting around mostly on my phone. At times this punishes me. Especially when I have a workday where realistically I could come in and really work for 4 hours and be out by lunch, but instead I sit around for 6 hours and end up pulling a 10 hour day to compensate as I rush to do everything last minute. \n\nI struggle to do some of the most basic things. Everybody's main advice always seems to be \"well just do it\" but I can't make myself sometimes. I know that sounds pathetic but when I need to do something like clean a room, work, whatever I panic and escape into my phone or something else.  \n\nI do have a history of depression dating back the past 12 years or so but I honestly think it's gotten better the past few.  I rarely have badly depressed days now, think I'm just kind of numb at this point. \n\nI'm making this post because it's beginning to effect those around me as well.

I'm sitting here now with the mindset of \"yes! Of course! I'll be better about everything immediately!\" but I know as soon as I'm home ill be so worn out for absolutely no reason and I'll just flop onto a chair or the couch and remain there for the most part until bed.  I dont want to be this way but it's like there's this pulling force of laziness and numbness to pressing matters that just pulls me downwards into a spiral of uselessness that's beginning to impact anything and everyone around me.  \n\nI shower once  or twice a week now.

It's not just dishes and showering- it's everything. I have nothing to look forward too and no sense of purpose to make me feel like actually trying to enjoy my time. Mindfulness seems to be lost on me the more and more I try it. Life is dull and boring and I've felt as if I was in a prison since I was a very young child.

Here are a few steps that might help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task to focus on each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or brushing your teeth twice a day. Small wins can build momentum and help you feel more in control.\n\n2. **Set a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but having a structure can help reduce decision fatigue and make it easier to get things done.\n\n3. **Limit Phone Time**: Consider setting specific times when you can use your phone, or use apps that limit screen time. This can help reduce distractions and make it easier to focus on tasks.\n\n4. **Energy Levels**: Since you’re feeling tired, it might be worth looking into your diet, hydration, and exercise habits. Sometimes small changes in these areas can boost energy levels.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If you’re comfortable, talk to your SO about how you’re feeling. They might be able to offer support or help you stay accountable.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned a history of depression, it might be helpful to check in with a mental health professional. They can offer guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - what you're describing sounds really rough, but it's good that you're reaching out and recognizing you want to make changes. The exhaustion + procrastination cycle is brutal, and \"just do it\" isn't helpful advice when you're stuck in that pattern.\n\nFirst, given your history of depression and current symptoms (exhaustion, numbness, hygiene struggles), it would be worth checking in with a doctor. Constant fatigue despite adequate sleep can have medical causes that need addressing.\n\nFor building better habits, start incredibly small. Don't try to transform everything at once. Pick ONE tiny habit - something that takes 2 minutes or less. Maybe it's putting one dish away right after using it, or wiping down one counter before bed. The goal isn't the task itself, but building the \"muscle\" of following through on what you plan to do.\n\nFor work productivity, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5 minute break. Start with just one pomodoro per day. Put your phone in another room during that time. Having a clear start/stop time makes tasks feel more manageable.\n\nWhen you notice yourself reaching for your phone to escape, pause and take 3 deep breaths. Name what you're feeling (\"I'm feeling overwhelmed about cleaning\"). This creates a tiny gap between impulse and action where you can choose differently.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about willpower - it's about systems and small wins that compound over time. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Focus on small, consistent actions that move you in the right direction.\n\nConsider sharing your goals with your SO and asking for their support. Having someone to be accountable to and celebrate small victories with can make a big difference.\n\nYou can absolutely turn this around. Take it one tiny step at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of motivation, productivity, and possibly some underlying mental health issues that are affecting your daily life. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help, so kudos to you for taking this step.\n\nGiven your history of depression, it's possible that your current state is related to that, even if you feel like you've been doing better lately. The numbness you mentioned can be a symptom of depression, and it might be contributing to your lack of motivation.\n\nRather than trying to tackle everything at once, let's start with small, achievable goals. For example, you could try setting a daily routine that includes some basic self-care activities like showering, brushing your teeth, and getting dressed. These small wins can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore the reasons behind your procrastination and escapism. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving these behaviors, you can start working on strategies to overcome them.\n\nIn terms of your work habits, it might be helpful to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day. This can help make your work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these issues and develop strategies for building motivation and productivity. They can also help you address any underlying mental health concerns that might be contributing to your current state.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help.

        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's easy to get stuck in those cycles of avoidance and numbness.\n\nFirst, that feeling of being physically and mentally tired all the time? Definitely worth getting a checkup with a doctor. Rule out any underlying medical issues like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. It could be a simple fix.\n\nSecond, let's break down the \"just do it\" advice, because it's rarely that simple. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on *tiny* wins. Seriously tiny. Like, \"I will stand up and walk to the kitchen\" tiny. Or \"I will brush my teeth *right now*.\" The goal isn't to accomplish a ton, it's to break the inertia and build momentum. Once you're up, maybe you rinse a dish. Maybe you don't. The point is you broke the cycle.\n\nFor work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Work for 25 minutes, *fully focused*, then take a 5-minute break to mess around on your phone. Knowing the break is coming can make those focused bursts more manageable. Track your focused time. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day at first, you'll see progress, and that's motivating.\n\nRegarding your SO's comment, instead of promising a complete turnaround (which sets you up for failure), have an honest conversation. Explain you're struggling and actively working on it. Maybe suggest tackling one small chore together each day. It's less pressure and builds connection.\n\nFinally, about the depression history: even if you feel \"numb\" rather than actively depressed, it's worth talking to a therapist. They can give you tools to manage the avoidance and build healthier coping mechanisms. You've recognized the problem, and that's half the battle. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You got this.\n"

Instead of jumping straight into complex meal prep, focus on quick, nutritious meals that take 15-20 minutes max.\n\nSome game-changers: keep pre-chopped vegetables in the fridge (way easier than meal prep, still fresh), and always have eggs, canned beans, and quick-cooking proteins on hand. A simple stir-fry with pre-cut veggies and chicken takes barely any time. Sheet pan dinners are also great - just toss everything on a pan and let the oven do the work while you rest your eyes.\n\nFor the screen fatigue, try the 20-20-20 rule during work: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It makes a huge difference in evening energy levels.\n\nThe key is making cooking as effortless as possible when you're tired. Start with just 2-3 really simple recipes you can make on autopilot. Once those become habit, you can expand your repertoire. Remember, a basic homemade meal is still way better than takeout, so don't feel pressure to make anything fancy.\n\nAlso, consider doing the bare minimum prep (like washing vegetables or marinating meat) in the morning when you're fresher. Even 5 minutes of morning prep makes evening cooking much more manageable.",

That way, I'm not feeling overwhelmed by a complicated recipe when I'm already exhausted. \n\nAnother strategy you might consider is breaking down your cooking into smaller tasks, like chopping veggies or marinating proteins, that you can do at different times of the day when you have a bit more energy. Then, when it's time to cook, it feels less daunting because some of the prep work is already done.\n\nSince you're looking to do two meal preps per week, you might also think about cooking in bulk on those days, but then portioning out individual servings that can be reheated quickly throughout the week. That way, you're not eating \"stale\" food, but you're still getting the benefits of having healthy meals ready to go. \n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if some nights you just can't cook - it's okay to have a backup plan, like a simple salad or some scrambled eggs, that requires minimal effort but still gets you a nutritious meal.

That way, during the week, you're just assembling things, not starting from scratch. It feels fresher than fully prepped meals.\n\nSecond, embrace quick & easy recipes. Think stir-fries, sheet pan dinners, or big salads. These can be thrown together in under 30 minutes. Websites like Budget Bytes or Skinnytaste have tons of ideas.\n\nThird, consider your \"eye fatigue\" trigger. Maybe blue light glasses or adjusting your screen brightness could help you feel less drained at the end of the day. Even a short break away from the screen every hour can make a difference. If you can tackle the eye fatigue, you might find you have more energy overall.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. If you slip up and order takeout one night, don't beat yourself up.

      "body": "Hey all, I've been browsing for a bit so I get the general idea of this sub-reddit. Many of my creative projects like programming, 3d modeling, game design, etc. I have a huge burst of motivation, energy, where I get a lot done in a short time frame, even being able to sit down and produce meaningful progress on many of them. Then follows maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe months of inactivity on them and I move onto another project, just eventually getting into that cycle all over again.\n\nI've tried to completely draw out my schedule, as in, what needs to get done, at what time, by what day, the description, all that. Yet I always fail to complete them (strangely enough though this doesn't really happen to me with writing). I feel like it's a mixture of burn out, frustration, and maybe incompetence? Once I hit a roadblock that I can't overcome after a decent amount of time, or having to learn a completely new library, plugin, leads to procrastination on my part. Of course, I do know that I am procrastinating during this, but anytime I try to force myself to sit down and think and get back into a similar state of mind when I was actually making progress, my mind starts to wander, and I eventually give up.\n\nIt also doesn't help that generally I'm much slower at making progress than I should. For example, it could take me 2 hours to finish a math homework that should only take 45 minutes or less, even if I completely understand the material and get the right answers. It's not like I CAN'T overcome the problem, it's just that I lose all motivation to even attempt the hours long debug or learning of something else after my initial burst. I've done this off-and-on for about since I was 13-14, so 2-3 years. It makes me sad to think about how if I were just consistent in my hobbies, I'd probably be really good at them, but I'm just not.\n\nIt would really help to receive some advice about this, sorry for the bad formatting. I might've also forgotten to provide details or such that would be helpful to give advice on, but I'm very quick to respond so please just ask. \n\nAlso generally, I want the discussion of advice to be about trying to figure out what it is in my mind that stops me from being consistent.

One thing that might help is focusing on building a habit of consistency rather than relying on motivation. Motivation is great for getting started, but habits are what keep you going when motivation dips. Try setting very small, manageable goals for each day, even if it's just 15 minutes of work on a project. This can help you build a routine without feeling overwhelmed. Also, consider reflecting on what specifically causes you to lose interest or hit a roadblock. Is it boredom, frustration, or something else? Understanding this can help you develop strategies to push through those moments. Lastly, remember that progress is progress, no matter how slow it feels. Keep at it, and over time, those small efforts will add up.",
        "claude_comment": "What you're describing sounds like a classic case of relying too heavily on motivation rather than building sustainable habits. Those initial bursts of energy feel great, but they often lead to burnout because you're trying to do too much too quickly.\n\nInstead of going all-in during motivation spikes, try deliberately limiting yourself to shorter, consistent work periods. For example, commit to just 25 minutes of focused work on a project each day, even if you feel like you could do more. This might feel frustratingly slow at first, but it's much more sustainable than the boom-bust cycle you're currently experiencing.\n\nThe roadblocks you hit with technical learning are totally normal - everyone faces them. The key difference is treating them as expected parts of the process rather than motivation-killers. When you hit one, break it down into smaller chunks. Instead of \"learn this entire library,\" make it \"understand just this one basic function today.\"\n\nYour slower pace isn't necessarily a problem - it's actually an opportunity to build patience and consistency. Rather than comparing yourself to how fast you \"should\" be going, focus on showing up regularly. Even 15 minutes of daily progress will get you further than sporadic bursts followed by weeks of nothing.\n\nConsider tracking your work sessions (just time spent, not necessarily output). This can help you spot patterns in when you tend to drop off and adjust accordingly. The goal isn't perfection - it's building a sustainable practice that you can maintain long-term.\n\nRemember: consistency beats intensity every time. Start small, stay steady, and let the compound effects work in your favor.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of the \"sprint and stall\" cycle, where you pour all your energy into a project for a short burst, only to lose momentum and struggle to get back on track. I think it's great that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to understand what's driving it, rather than just trying to force yourself into a schedule.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is your mention of hitting roadblocks or having to learn new things, and how that leads to procrastination. It's possible that you're experiencing a fear of not being able to overcome these challenges, or a fear of not being good enough, which is causing you to disengage from the project altogether. This could be related to a fixed mindset, where you believe your abilities are innate and unchangeable, rather than a growth mindset, where you see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.\n\nAnother possibility is that you're simply not giving yourself permission to work at a slower pace, or to make mistakes. You mention feeling like you should be able to finish tasks more quickly, but maybe that's just not your natural rhythm. Perhaps you need to experiment with working in shorter, more focused intervals, with regular breaks to recharge and reflect on your progress.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention writing as an exception to this pattern. What is it about writing that feels different to you? Is it the creative freedom, the lack of technical hurdles, or something else entirely? Exploring what makes writing work for you might give us some clues about how to apply those same principles to your other projects.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to not be consistent all the time. It's a myth that creatives need to be constantly producing in order to be valid or successful. Maybe instead of beating yourself up over your lack of consistency, you could try practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's a normal part of the creative process. What do you think?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That cycle of hyper-focus followed by a motivation crash is super common, especially with creative projects. It sounds less like incompetence and more like you're riding the wave of dopamine and then crashing when things get tough or less exciting.\n\nInstead of focusing on grand schedules, maybe try micro-goals. Seriously tiny ones. Like, \"spend 5 minutes on 3D modeling\" or \"write one line of code.\" The point isn't to achieve a lot in those 5 minutes, but to break the inertia and make it less daunting to start. Often, once you're in, you'll keep going.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself about the roadblocks. Instead of seeing them as failures, view them as learning opportunities. When you hit one, schedule a specific time to research it, maybe 30 minutes. If you still can't figure it out, reach out for help online or from a friend. Knowing you have a plan to tackle the problem can reduce the anxiety that leads to procrastination.\n\nFinally, consider that maybe you're spreading yourself too thin. Jumping between multiple projects might be fueling the burnout. Could you pick *one* project to focus on for a set period, even if it's just a month, and see if that helps you build consistency? Good luck, you got this!\n"

I become bored, disinterested, or impatient with big things like studying, but also the small stuff which is where I noticed the pattern initially. For example, if I'm watching a video on how to do something or just a video where something is supposed to happen based on the title, I repeatedly try and skip to that part, often taking more time in doing so than the actual length of the video. I also haven't had as much interest in video games for more than an hour or so on top of the more serious things. I'm contemplating getting seen for ADHD but wanted to hear some advice and/or opinions. Thanks!",

Don't consume any \"content\" before 6pm (no social media, no news, no YouTube, no video games, no TV, no audiobooks, no podcasts, no paper books, nothing). Use an app/website blocker like Freedom to support you.\n2. Work in focused 25-50 minute periods with social support. I use Focusmate for that. During those focused work periods, only do one thing at at time.\n\nThe combination reset my attention span. I thought my brain was broken but now I can read difficult books for fun in the evenings.\n\nThe no content thing I had to work up to, and I still only do about 90% perfectly, but it works extremely well.

        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue these days, and it's great that you're looking for ways to address it. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks**: When you're studying or working on something big, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help maintain your focus.\n\n2. **Set Timers**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and focused.\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those interruptions. This could mean putting your phone on silent or using apps that block distracting websites.\n\n4. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can improve your attention span over time. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.\n\n5. **Evaluate Your Environment**: Sometimes, a change in your study or work environment can help. Make sure your space is conducive to focus—good lighting, comfortable seating, and minimal noise can all contribute.\n\n6. **Consider Professional Help**: If you suspect ADHD, it might be worth consulting a professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and suggest strategies or treatments that are tailored to your needs.\n\nRemember, improving focus is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Getting checked for ADHD is definitely worth exploring, but there are also some practical steps you can take right now to help rebuild your attention span. Our modern world of infinite scrolling and instant gratification has really done a number on most people's ability to focus.\n\nStart by creating designated \"deep focus\" periods - even just 15-20 minutes at first. During these times, put your phone in another room and use website blockers if needed. The key is removing the temptation to constantly switch tasks or seek immediate stimulation.\n\nFor videos specifically, try making yourself watch them straight through without skipping. It's like training a muscle - uncomfortable at first but gets easier with practice. You can also try taking notes while watching to stay actively engaged.\n\nWith gaming and other activities, set a timer for 30 minutes of focused play. When the timer goes off, take a quick break, then decide if you want to continue. This helps build back the ability to stick with one thing instead of constantly seeking novelty.\n\nReading physical books (not ebooks) can also help retrain your attention span. Start with just 10 minutes daily and gradually increase. The lack of hyperlinks and notifications makes it easier to maintain focus.\n\nRemember that attention span is malleable - you can absolutely improve it with consistent practice. While getting evaluated for ADHD is a good idea, implementing these strategies can help regardless of the underlying cause.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with sustaining focus and attention, which can be really frustrating. Before exploring medical options, you might want to try a few strategies to see if you can improve your attention span on your own. One thing that could help is setting small, achievable goals for yourself when working on tasks or watching videos - this can make it feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each goal. Additionally, trying to eliminate distractions while you're focused on something might be helpful - turn off notifications, find a quiet space, etc. It's also possible that your brain is just used to the instant gratification of being able to skip around or switch between tasks quickly, so trying to practice patience and persistence could be beneficial. As for the video game thing, it's not uncommon for interests to wax and wane over time, but if you're finding that you're having trouble focusing on games as well, it might be worth exploring why that is - are you feeling bored with the types of games you're playing, or is it just hard to sit still for an extended period? Exploring these questions and trying out some new strategies might give you a better sense of what's going on and whether seeking medical attention is the right next step.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of your attention slipping away is super frustrating. It's good you're thinking about potential causes and seeking advice.\n\nBefore jumping to ADHD, which is definitely something to explore with a professional if you're concerned, let's look at some things you can try to build back your focus.\n\nFirst, try the Pomodoro Technique. It's basically working in focused 25-minute bursts with short 5-minute breaks in between. It can help you trick your brain into staying engaged for those shorter periods, and then you can gradually increase the work intervals as you get better.\n\nSecond, think about your environment. Are you constantly bombarded with notifications or distractions? Try putting your phone on silent, closing unnecessary tabs, and finding a quiet space to work or study. Even just decluttering your desk can make a difference.\n\nThird, for the video skipping thing, try actively engaging with the content. Take notes, pause and summarize what you've learned, or even try teaching it to someone else (even if it's just to your cat!). Active learning is way more engaging than passively watching.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. Don't expect to go from zero to a hundred overnight. It's a process, and there will be days when you struggle. Just keep practicing, and you'll start to see improvement. And if you're still concerned after trying these things, definitely talk to a doctor or therapist about ADHD. Good luck!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Finding a balance between indulging in distractions and dealing with anxiety can be tough, but it's definitely possible with some small steps. Start by setting aside a short, dedicated time each day to be device-free. Use this time to engage in activities that are calming but still engaging, like reading a book, drawing, or going for a walk. This can help ease you into being comfortable with your thoughts without overwhelming anxiety. Also, consider practicing mindfulness or meditation for a few minutes daily. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and reduce anxiety over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be patient with yourself as you work towards finding that middle ground.",
        "claude_comment": "What you're describing is actually a common challenge - the contrast between constant stimulation and sitting with our thoughts. The good news is that you can gradually build tolerance for both focused attention and managing anxiety.\n\nStart by creating small pockets of device-free time, maybe 10-15 minutes at first. During these periods, try simple activities like taking a walk, doing a puzzle, or reading a physical book. These give your mind something concrete to focus on while stepping away from high-dopamine activities.\n\nFor managing anxious thoughts, consider starting a basic mindfulness practice. The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety but to observe thoughts without getting caught up in them. Even 5 minutes of focusing on your breathing can help build this skill.\n\nYou might also benefit from having a \"worry time\" - set aside 15 minutes daily to actively process your concerns. Write them down, consider solutions, then move on. When anxious thoughts pop up outside this time, remind yourself you'll address them during the designated period.\n\nRemember that both extremes - constant stimulation and overwhelming anxiety - are learned responses that can be gradually adjusted. Take small steps, be patient with yourself, and celebrate progress along the way. Building a more balanced relationship with both stimulation and stillness takes time, but it's absolutely achievable.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're caught between two extremes, and finding a balance is key. One strategy could be to start small by setting aside device-free time in short intervals, like 10-15 minutes a day, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. During this time, try to focus on a single, calming activity, such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or a short walk. This can help your mind adjust to not relying on dopamine-inducing activities for comfort. Additionally, consider exploring stress management techniques, like mindfulness meditation or yoga, which can help you develop coping mechanisms for anxiety. It's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to take things at your own pace and not expect to overhaul your habits overnight. By taking tiny steps towards finding this middle ground, you can work on building resilience and developing a more mature mindset that can handle stress in a healthier way.",

It sounds like you're looking for a way to build resilience and find a healthier balance.\n\nOne thing that might help is to start small with facing those anxious thoughts. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Maybe dedicate just 5-10 minutes a day to sitting with your thoughts, without judgment. You could even try journaling – writing them down can sometimes take the edge off.\n\nAs for the dopamine hits, try replacing them gradually instead of cutting them out cold turkey. If you spend hours on social media, try reducing it by 15 minutes each day and replacing that time with something slightly more productive or relaxing, like reading or a short walk. The key is to make the alternative appealing enough that you don't feel like you're depriving yourself.\n\nBuilding discipline is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and don't beat yourself up for slip-ups. They're part of the process. You got this!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking for advice. That takes courage. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-esteem and social anxiety, and there are ways to work through it.\n\nStart small. Pick one thing you want to improve and focus on that. For example, if it's social skills, try setting a goal to have a short conversation with someone each day, even if it's just a simple \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" It might feel awkward at first, but practice helps.\n\nFor ADHD, consider breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Use tools like timers or apps to help with time management. It can also be helpful to write things down to keep track of what you need to do.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be introverted. You don't have to be the life of the party to be successful or happy. Embrace who you are and focus on your strengths. Maybe look for jobs that align with your interests and where being introverted is an asset.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there. The way you're feeling right now is rough, but it's not permanent and it's not beyond repair. Let's break this down into manageable pieces.\n\nFirst, having ADHD means your brain works differently - not worse, just different. Many successful people have ADHD and have found ways to work with it rather than against it. Instead of trying to force yourself to be good at multitasking, lean into your ability to hyperfocus. Find roles that let you tackle one thing at a time.\n\nStart small. Really small. Pick one tiny skill you'd like to improve and practice it for just 5 minutes a day. Maybe it's making small talk with the grocery store cashier, or reading about a topic that interests you. The goal isn't to become an expert - it's just to prove to yourself that you can grow.\n\nFor job hunting, try looking for positions that play to your strengths rather than forcing yourself into roles that drain you. Introverts can excel in many careers - data analysis, writing, programming, research, skilled trades - where the focus is on your work rather than constant social interaction. \n\nStop comparing yourself to others - they're running a different race with different starting points. Instead, compare yourself to where you were yesterday. Even tiny improvements count.\n\nThe fact that you feel better when you're confident shows that your personality isn't the problem - your self-talk is. Work on building small wins that you can look back on. Keep a \"wins journal\" where you write down one thing you did well each day, no matter how small.\n\nYou've already shown courage by reaching out for advice. That's a win right there. Build on that momentum, one tiny step at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with some tough feelings about yourself, and it's making it hard for you to see a path forward in your career. One thing that might be helpful is to try to separate your self-worth from your job prospects. Instead of thinking \"I'm not good enough to do this job,\" try to focus on what specific skills or tasks you're interested in and see if there are any jobs that align with those. You don't have to be the most outgoing or charismatic person to succeed - many jobs value quiet, detail-oriented workers, for example. \n\nIt might also be helpful to start small and build up your confidence gradually. Instead of looking at big, intimidating jobs like being a trivia host, what are some smaller steps you could take to get more experience and build your skills? Could you try volunteering or taking on a part-time job in a low-stakes environment? This could help you get a feel for what you're capable of and start to build up your self-esteem. \n\nLastly, it's worth remembering that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparing yourself to others is often not very helpful. Instead of focusing on what you think you're lacking, try to focus on what you do bring to the table - your unique perspective, skills, and experiences. And don't forget that ADHD is a legitimate condition that can affect people's lives in many ways - it's not something to be ashamed of, and there are many successful people with ADHD who have learned to work with their strengths and challenges.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not beyond repair. A lot of what you're describing is a cycle, and discipline can be a tool to break it.\n\nFirst, about the job thing: instead of focusing on dream jobs that feel impossible right now, what about aiming for something small and manageable? Think about skills you *want* to develop, not just what you think you're already good at (or not good at). Even a part-time gig where you interact with a few people could be a starting point. The goal isn't to be perfect, it's to get some experience and build confidence.\n\nRegarding the self-loathing, that's a bigger beast, but discipline can help there too. Start small. Really small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire personality, pick ONE tiny thing you want to improve. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. The key is consistency. When you start proving to yourself that you *can* stick to something, even something small, it builds momentum.\n\nAlso, comparison is the thief of joy. Seriously. Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger those feelings. Focus on your own progress, not someone else's highlight reel.\n\nFinally, for the ADHD stuff, have you explored strategies specifically for managing it? There are tons of resources out there, from apps to organizational techniques. Finding what works for you can make a huge difference in managing time and focus.\n\nIt's not going to be an overnight fix, but small, consistent steps can lead to big changes.

        "best_comment": "Firstly, I would start by saying, your first problem is thinking that you need motivation. Yeah, you heard me right. The greatest mirage society has ever created is that notion that “you need to feel motivated to be able to accomplish something”; this right here messed me up through out secondary school, I repeatedly kept failing classes all because I was too busy worrying that I couldn’t read unless I was motivated. Here’s where discipline comes in; doing it not because you FEEL like but because your growth as an individual DEPENDS on it ( this doesn’t apply only to academics).\n\n     I know all these might sound like a cliché but I’m honestly speaking from experience. I’m currently in my 1st year law major(18m) in my undergraduate University , 1st semester was hell on earth for me. However, what helped me was that I started looking into what my problems actually were, because after I read a book called “atomic habits”, it helped me understand myself better. One good point it made was this “our minds are pre-conditioned to avoid anything that stresses us”, and it deals with these through procrastination that usually comes out as lack of motivation. \n\nAfter identifying these problems, I  now had to ask myself “why does studying stress me out”? I did some research and it turned out that I had a terrible reading habit of regression and fixation; They are conscious acts of re-reading sentences and reading one word at a time, which impairs reading comprehension and efficiency. After this discovery, I worked hard to find a solution to them.  Over the months, I have consistently improved on them. Saying that by addressing these problems helped boost my academic performance would be an understatement in all honesty, because I went from procrastinating on a 12page weekly reading  to handling 70+ page weekly readings, and I ended up getting straight A’s in my previous semester, thanks to way I addressed these problems.\n\n \nLastly doing all these was extremely heart wrenching for me and incredibly frustrating as well. There were  many points in time where I wanted to give up, but I continued, not because I was motivated to but because I had to. \n\nP.S : Hope this helps, and good luck with your exams!",

The good news is you've already proven you can study effectively (7 hours a day is impressive!), so we know you've got it in you.\n\nHere's what tends to work well in these situations: Start by breaking your study sessions into smaller chunks, like 25-30 minutes, with short breaks in between. This makes getting started feel way less daunting than thinking about hours of studying. Set a timer and just commit to that first chunk - often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you're in the flow.\n\nCreate a simple study schedule for the next few weeks. Map out specific topics for each day rather than vague \"study time.\" Having clear, bite-sized goals makes it easier to track progress and stay motivated.\n\nAlso, your study environment matters a lot. Find a spot that's just for studying - could be a library, a specific desk, whatever works. When you're there, you're in study mode. Period.\n\nRemember, motivation comes and goes - that's normal.

The good news is you already know what works for you - the workout schedule, meal planning, and clear vision. Those habits aren't gone, they just need to be adapted to your new environment.\n\nSince you can't control the overall house energy, focus on creating your own space and schedule. Try to maintain your workout routine by either going to a gym or finding a quiet spot in/around the house for home workouts. For meals, you could meal prep your own healthy options separately or offer to cook some healthier meals for the family occasionally.\n\nTo minimize screen time and stay focused, consider spending time in your local library or finding a quiet coffee shop where you can work on your goals without the household distractions. Even a nearby park can be a great place to reset and plan.\n\nThe key is to treat your room or designated spaces as your \"apartment within the house\" - a place where you can maintain your positive habits. Set boundaries around your personal time and space while still being respectful of family dynamics. You might even find that your dedication to healthy habits gradually influences others in a positive way.\n\nRemember - you developed those good habits once, and you can absolutely maintain them in this new situation.

This could be a corner of your room or even just a specific chair where you can sit and work out your plans and vision without being disturbed.\n\nAnother strategy could be to establish a daily routine that you stick to, regardless of what's going on around you. So, even if the rest of the household is eating unhealthy food, you could still prepare your own meals according to your meal plan. And instead of trying to change the entire household's energy, focus on what you can control - your own actions and reactions. You might also consider finding ways to get out of the house regularly, whether that's going for a walk, meeting up with friends, or hitting the gym, to give yourself a break from the environment and stay connected to your goals.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time and not expect to have everything figured out right away. You've already shown that you're capable of creating positive habits and achieving your goals when you were living alone, so try to tap back into that mindset and see what works for you in this new situation.

Treat them like non-negotiable appointments. Maybe even put them on a shared family calendar (if you have one) so everyone knows when you need your space.\n\nFor the screen time, try setting timers or using apps that limit your usage. Replace that time with something you enjoy that doesn't involve a screen – reading, journaling, even just going for a walk.\n\nAs for the overall environment, it's tough to change other people's habits, but you *can* control your own reactions. Maybe suggest a family activity that's a little healthier, like a walk after dinner, but don't push it. Focus on creating your own little bubble of positivity and productivity. Noise-canceling headphones can be a lifesaver!\n\nMost importantly, remember why you wanted to build those healthy habits in the first place.

This can help ease you back into a work mindset without overwhelming you. Also, try to reconnect with what you enjoyed about your previous work or explore new areas within your field that might spark interest.

But here's the thing: motivation is unreliable, and waiting for it to show up isn't the answer. What you need is to rebuild your work muscles through small, consistent actions.\n\nStart by setting a structured daily schedule, even while unemployed. Wake up at the same time, get dressed, and treat job searching or skill development as your current \"job.\" Even 2-3 hours a day of focused effort is better than nothing.\n\nSince you have an opportunity in your previous field, use that as your starting point. The familiar territory means you already have valuable experience and skills. Consider starting part-time if possible - it can help ease the transition back into working life without feeling overwhelming.\n\nRemember that work isn't just about money - it provides structure, purpose, and social connections. Your savings won't last forever, and it's much better to return to work while you still have that financial cushion rather than waiting until you're forced to take any job out of desperation.\n\nTake that opportunity.

Is it fear of going back to a similar work environment, or is it something else? Identifying the root of your resistance might help you address it directly. Additionally, you could try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like updating your resume or attending a networking event, to get yourself moving in the right direction. It's also worth considering what aspects of your previous job you enjoyed, and whether this new opportunity aligns with those interests. Sometimes, having something to look forward to can make getting started easier.

Motivation often comes *after* you start doing something, not before.\n\nHere's a thought: Instead of jumping straight back into a full-time job, could you explore some low-pressure options? Maybe some freelance work in your field, or even just a few hours a week consulting? This could help you ease back in and regain some momentum without the overwhelming feeling of a full commitment.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you want to work again, beyond just the money. What are your values? Does working give you a sense of purpose, accomplishment, or social connection? Connecting with those values can be a powerful motivator.\n\nFinally, consider breaking down the job search process into tiny, manageable tasks. Today, maybe just update your resume.

This helps maintain your circadian rhythm while still giving you some extra rest.

The goal isn't to make weekends as rigid as weekdays, but to find a middle ground.\n\nConsider scheduling your most important weekend tasks for Saturday morning when you typically have more energy. Even just 2-3 hours of focused work then leaves you plenty of time for relaxation and socializing later. You might find it helpful to make a short list on Friday afternoon of 2-3 priority tasks for the weekend.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being productive 24/7.

The key is to keep trying and be kind to yourself in the process. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "From what you've described, this sounds a lot more like potential ADHD than simple laziness. The constant need for stimulation, difficulty with tasks requiring sustained effort, and struggles with executive function are classic signs. Getting properly evaluated by a mental health professional would be a good first step.\n\nBut you're definitely not hopeless. Let's focus on what you can do right now to start turning things around:\n\nFirst, accept that cold turkey approaches like locking away your computer probably won't work long-term. Instead, start incredibly small. Pick ONE 10-minute block each day where you'll study. That's it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast. The goal isn't productivity - it's just building the tiny habit of showing up.\n\nFor gaming, set a strict timer for 1 hour of play. When it goes off, you must do something else for at least 15 minutes before gaming again. This helps break the compulsive cycle while still allowing some enjoyment.\n\nYour brain is clearly crying out for dopamine hits. Give it some through healthier channels - take a 10 minute walk, do 5 pushups, or spend 5 minutes practicing an instrument. These build in natural rewards that aren't as intense as gaming but are more sustainable.\n\nFor the final exams - break everything into absurdly small chunks. Don't think \"study chapter 5.\" Think \"read one page\" or \"do two practice problems.\" String these micro-tasks together and you'll build momentum.\n\nThe key is to stop fighting your brain's need for stimulation and instead work with it. Use timers, frequent breaks, and tiny goals. Build from there. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help - that shows you have the self-awareness and motivation to improve. Take it one tiny step at a time.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough combination of challenges, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. First, let's acknowledge that this doesn't sound like simple laziness - the fact that you've tried various methods to stay on track and are still struggling suggests there may be some underlying issues at play, possibly related to ADHD or other mental health concerns. \n\nGiven your struggles with focus and procrastination, it might be helpful to start small and work on building tiny habits that you can actually stick to. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one thing you want to work on - like studying for your exams or practicing a musical instrument - and commit to doing it for just 5-10 minutes a day. That's it. Don't worry about being productive or achieving some big goal, just focus on showing up and doing the thing for that short amount of time.\n\nIt's also worth considering seeking out professional help, whether that's a therapist or a doctor who can help you explore the possibility of ADHD or other underlying conditions. They may be able to provide you with more targeted strategies and support to help you get back on track.\n\nAs for your hobbies, it might be helpful to try to rekindle some of that old spark - not by feeling like you need to create something perfect, but just by doing the thing for its own sake. So, instead of trying to make a funny video, just mess around with video editing software for a bit and see what happens. You might find that it helps you tap into some of that creative energy and motivation.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself - it's okay to not have everything figured out right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not hopeless, and there is definitely still a way forward. It's just going to take some patience, self-compassion, and experimentation to find what works for you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not hopeless. It's great that you're reaching out and recognizing the need for change.\n\nFirst, regarding the possible ADHD, it's worth getting a professional assessment. A diagnosis (or ruling it out) can give you clarity and open doors to appropriate strategies and support. Don't self-diagnose, but definitely explore it with a doctor or therapist.\n\nSecond, let's tackle the procrastination and lack of focus. Three months is still enough time to make a difference for your exams. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick *one* subject and commit to studying it for just 15 minutes each day. Seriously, just 15. Use a timer. The goal isn't to master the subject in 15 minutes, it's to break the inertia and build a habit. Once you're consistently doing 15 minutes, gradually increase it.\n\nThird, address the video game issue. Cold turkey might not be sustainable. Instead, try setting strict time limits and only allowing yourself to play *after* you've completed your study goal for the day. Make it a reward, not a default. Also, actively seek out alternative activities. Remember those musical instruments and video editing? Even if you don't feel the \"knack\" right away, force yourself to spend 30 minutes on one of them. The joy might return with practice.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not lazy, you're struggling. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Celebrate small wins. And remember, progress isn't linear. There will be setbacks, but don't let them derail you. Get back on track the next day. You've got this.\n"

I think if i would have met myself when im liberated i would not talk to myself or even go near me. \n\nI have a small social anxiety (as everyone) and speech anxiety, but these are bypassed when im feeling good in this partitullar group. Im working on my communication skills (cause i have almost 0), but it is really hard to discover my shortcomings and i think im on the autistic spectrum (just a little) for example 98 per 100 time i dont feel uncomfortable silence, dont know what to say when meeting someone and what when saying goodbye, how to respond someone who told something about his/hers feelings or a random event that he/she went on etc. **I feel like i can never get my thoughts across to others, they dont understand what im saying (even if they do).** And i dont want any misunderstanding. **I feel like i did something bad every time.**\n\nI feel this almost every time after talking to someone  or talking with a teacher, friend, stranger etc. **I always feel like i said something that is not matching word/not corresponding with the situation like i did something unforgettably bad to them.**. I think im not trying to please anyone, but **i have this unsolvable paradox that i want to be the cool quiet kid who is really considered about everything and the same time i want to be the spontaneous kid**. My psychologist said it could be cause my (divorced)parents are totally different and they \"represent\" this dilemma of mine, it sounds logical, but i dont know yet...\n\n*I hope my thoughts are understandable and logical.

Sounds like there's some internal stuff that needs to be worked through and you're already working on it. That's great! My advice would just to be patient. These things can take time, but you're further ahead now than you were in the past. Keep going! You have a determined attitude and because of that, you'll be okay.",

        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're navigating a complex mix of emotions and social dynamics, which is totally normal. First off, it's great that you're working on your communication skills and seeing a psychologist—those are solid steps. Feeling guilt or shame after social interactions can be tough, but remember, it's okay to have different sides to your personality. You don't have to fit into one mold all the time. \n\nOne thing that might help is to practice self-compassion. When you feel that post-interaction guilt, remind yourself that it's okay to be imperfect and that your friends didn't mind your jokes. You could also try reflecting on these interactions afterward, maybe jotting down what went well and what you might want to adjust next time. This can help you see patterns and gradually build confidence in your social skills.\n\nLastly, try to embrace the fact that it's okay to be both the \"cool quiet kid\" and the \"spontaneous kid.\" You can be both, depending on the situation and how you feel. It's all part of being human. Keep working on understanding yourself, and over time, you'll likely find a balance that feels right for you.",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - what you're describing is actually pretty common, especially for people working on their social skills. That back-and-forth between feeling great in the moment and then second-guessing everything afterwards can be really draining.\n\nHere's something that might help: Start keeping quick notes after social interactions where you felt good. Write down what went well, how others responded positively, and any genuine laughs or good moments you shared. When the shame spiral tries to kick in later, you can look back at these concrete examples that show you weren't actually being harmful or inappropriate.\n\nThe paradox you mentioned about wanting to be both the quiet, thoughtful person and the spontaneous one isn't actually a paradox - it's totally possible to be both. Think of it like having different gears for different situations. Sometimes you're in quiet mode, other times you're in social mode, and both are equally valid parts of who you are.\n\nOne practical exercise: Next time you're with that particular group where you feel comfortable, try to notice what specifically makes you feel safe enough to be more outgoing. Maybe it's their body language, their reactions, or the overall vibe. Understanding these elements can help you gradually bring that confidence into other social situations.\n\nRemember - if people keep hanging out with you and actively tell you they don't mind your jokes, they're probably being honest. Trust their words rather than the anxious voice that shows up afterwards.\n\nKeep working with your psychologist on this, but know that you're already making progress by being aware and working on your communication skills. That's more than many people ever do.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of an identity crisis, where the person you are in social situations doesn't align with your everyday self, and that's causing feelings of shame and guilt. First, let's acknowledge that it's completely normal to have different personas in different situations - it doesn't mean you're being fake or insincere, it just means you're adapting to your environment.\n\nIt's great that you've found a group where you feel liberated and can be yourself without worrying about your speech defect or social anxiety. Instead of beating yourself up over the fact that this persona is different from your everyday self, try to see it as a strength - you're able to connect with people and have fun in a way that feels authentic to you in that moment.\n\nRegarding your concerns about communication skills and feeling like you're not getting your thoughts across, it might be helpful to focus on the fact that people are more likely to remember how you made them feel than the exact words you used. So, even if you don't always say the \"right\" thing, if you're coming from a place of kindness and genuine interest, that's what will shine through.\n\nAs for your paradox of wanting to be both the cool quiet kid and the spontaneous kid, maybe it's not about choosing one or the other, but about finding a balance between the two. You can work on developing your communication skills and being more confident in social situations, while also embracing your quieter side and learning to navigate those uncomfortable silences.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're working with a psychologist to explore these feelings and concerns - that takes a lot of courage and self-awareness.

        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's awesome that you're reaching out and trying to understand yourself better. That's a huge first step.\n\nIt seems like you're struggling with reconciling different versions of yourself and then feeling guilty about it. A couple of thoughts: First, it's totally normal to act differently in different social situations. We all have different \"modes\" depending on who we're with and the environment. Don't beat yourself up too much about not being a single, consistent personality.\n\nSecond, that feeling of saying something \"wrong\" or not being understood is super common, especially with social anxiety. One thing that might help is to actively listen and try to mirror the other person's communication style. Pay attention to their body language and the way they phrase things. It can make you feel more in sync and reduce that feeling of mismatch.\n\nAlso, maybe try journaling after social interactions. Write down what you said, how you felt, and what you think the other person's reaction was. Over time, you might start to see patterns in your thinking and identify specific triggers for your anxiety. It can also help you realize that things probably weren't as bad as you thought they were in the moment.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're working on your communication skills, and that takes time and effort. Celebrate the small wins and don't get discouraged by setbacks. Maybe even try setting small, achievable goals for each social interaction, like making eye contact or asking one follow-up question. Good luck, you got this!\n"

First off, remember that it's completely normal to feel pressure and anxiety when something important is on the line. The key is to channel that energy into productive action. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Instead of thinking about the exam as one huge task, break your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. Set daily goals that are achievable and specific. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\n2. **Create a Schedule**: Structure can be your best friend right now. Make a study schedule that includes breaks and stick to it. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus.\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify your biggest distractions and find ways to minimize them. This might mean setting specific times for social media or using apps that block distracting sites while you study.\n\n4. **Visualize Success**: Spend a few minutes each day visualizing yourself succeeding in the exam. This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can be a great stress reliever. Even a short walk or some stretching can clear your mind and improve focus.\n\n6. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to someone who has been through this process or a mentor who can offer guidance and support.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection.

        "claude_comment": "The pressure you're feeling is completely normal given what's at stake. But here's the thing - you're sabotaging yourself because you're afraid of giving it your all and still failing. It's easier to say \"I didn't really try\" than \"I tried my absolute hardest and it wasn't enough.\"\n\nFirst, you need to accept that failure is possible even with your best effort. That's scary, but it's also liberating. When you truly accept this, you can stop avoiding the work and start focusing on what's in your control - your daily actions.\n\nFor the next month, create a strict daily schedule. Break your study sessions into 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro technique). Start with just 4 chunks per day and gradually increase. During study time, put your phone in another room and use website blockers for distracting sites.\n\nEach evening, write down your specific study goals for the next day. Make them concrete and achievable - like \"Complete practice problems 1-20\" rather than just \"study hard.\"\n\nRemember, MIT isn't a dream - it's a goal that requires consistent action. Whether you succeed or fail won't be determined by fate or luck, but by what you do in these next 30 days. Every time you feel the urge to procrastinate, ask yourself: \"What would my future self want me to do right now?\"\n\nYou've already put in a year of preparation.

I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar feelings and challenges.\n\nStarting small can be really helpful. Pick one thing you want to work on and focus on that. It could be as simple as setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a hobby or exercise. The key is to build small, manageable habits that can gradually lead to bigger changes. \n\nAlso, try to be kind to yourself. It's easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate your wins, even if they seem minor. \n\nLastly, don't compare your journey to others. Everyone has their own path, and what works for someone else might not work for you.

        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not weak, and you're taking a huge positive step by seeking therapy and medical support. That's actually really strong.\n\nStarting over with discipline when you feel scattered is tough, but here's what works: Start ridiculously small. I mean tiny. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE thing - maybe making your bed each morning, or drinking a glass of water when you wake up. Something so small it feels almost silly. Do just that one thing consistently for a week.\n\nThe key is building evidence for yourself that you CAN follow through. Each tiny win creates momentum. Once that first habit feels automatic (usually 1-2 weeks), add one more small thing. Maybe a 5-minute walk, or putting dishes directly in the dishwasher after eating.\n\nYour ADD makes this harder, so work with it rather than against it. Use external systems - set specific times, use reminders, make things visible. Put your workout clothes right by your bed if exercise is your goal. Make the good choice the easy choice.\n\nThe self-hate stuff is rough, but action comes first, feelings follow. You don't need to feel worthy or confident to start - you just need to start. Focus on doing rather than feeling.\n\nRemember: You're not starting over \"late\" - you're starting exactly when you needed to. Many people never start at all. Take it one absurdly small step at a time, celebrate those tiny wins, and keep building from there. You've got this.",

It's clear that you've been carrying around a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's understandable that it's hard to envision a future for yourself when you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, focus on building one or two new habits that you can realistically stick to. This could be something as simple as taking a short walk each day, or dedicating 10 minutes each morning to meditation or journaling. The key is to build momentum and start to see yourself as capable of making positive changes.\n\nIt's also great that you're seeking out therapy and speaking with a doctor - having a support system in place can make a huge difference in your journey. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and that you don't have to have it all figured out right now. You're not weak for struggling with depression and anxiety - these are serious conditions that require treatment and support.\n\nIn terms of finding your passions and interests, you might try exploring different activities or hobbies without putting too much pressure on yourself to find \"the one thing\" that you're meant to do. Sometimes, it's the process of trying new things and seeing what sticks that can help us discover our strengths and interests. And don't worry if you don't have a clear vision for your future right now - that can develop over time as you continue to work on yourself and build your confidence.\n\nLastly, try to be kinder to yourself - it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks, and it doesn't mean that you're not worth it. You are worthy of growth, success, and happiness, regardless of your past or your struggles. Keep in mind that everyone starts from somewhere, and it's never too late to make a change and start building the life you want.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're reaching out and wanting to change is a huge first step. It's definitely not easy, but it's possible.\n\nFirst, good on you for seeking therapy and talking to a doctor. That's crucial, especially with ADD and potential depression/anxiety. Meds can help level the playing field, and therapy can give you tools to manage your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nAs for the \"starting from zero\" feeling, I get it. It's overwhelming to think about fixing everything at once. Instead of a complete overhaul, try focusing on ONE small habit at a time. Seriously, just one. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. Something achievable that you can consistently do. Once that feels automatic, add another small habit.\n\nRegarding the lack of passion/career direction, don't beat yourself up. A lot of people feel that way. Instead of searching for some grand purpose, try exploring different activities. Volunteer, take a class, join a club – just try things that vaguely interest you. You might stumble upon something you enjoy, or at least learn what you *don't* like.\n\nThe self-sabotage and fear of success are common. Therapy can help you unpack those feelings. In the meantime, try reframing your thinking. Instead of \"I'm not worth it,\" try \"I deserve to give myself a chance.\" It sounds cheesy, but small shifts in perspective can make a difference.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. You're not going to transform overnight. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're back at square one. That's okay. Just keep showing up and trying. Celebrate small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this.\n"

Pick ONE tiny action you can do today - maybe making your bed, drinking a glass of water, or stepping outside for 2 minutes. The action itself matters less than building the tiniest sense of momentum.\n\nThe key is to prove to yourself that you can do something, anything, different from your current pattern. Your brain is currently wired to resist change because staying in the comfort zone feels safer. But each small win starts rewiring those neural pathways.\n\nWhen you complete that tiny action, really let yourself feel good about it. Don't dismiss it as too small or meaningless. You're building evidence that you can take action, even when it's hard.\n\nTomorrow, do that same tiny thing again. Once it starts feeling automatic (might take days or weeks), add one more small action. The compound effect of these minimal changes will start shifting your mindset naturally.\n\nFor the emotional side - try this: When you notice yourself feeling like a victim, pause and ask \"What's one microscopic thing within my control right now?\" Then do that thing. Control builds through action, not the other way around.\n\nRemember: You don't need to figure everything out at once. Just focus on proving to yourself that you're capable of small changes.

Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and take a single, tiny action towards it. For example, if you want to start exercising, your first step might be as simple as putting on your workout clothes or doing one push-up. It's not about achieving some kind of grand transformation overnight, but about building momentum and developing a sense of control and agency over your life. As for changing your mindset, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge some of the negative self-talk that's holding you back. Instead of beating yourself up over your perceived weaknesses, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. Remember that personal growth is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, just a willingness to show up and take that first step.",

Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up. The point isn't the task itself, but the feeling of accomplishment you get from actually *doing* something.\n\nThat little win can create a tiny ripple effect. Once you've consistently done that one small thing for a week or two, add another. Maybe it's going for a 10-minute walk. Again, keep it small and manageable.\n\nAs for feeling like a victim, that's a tough one. A lot of times, that comes from focusing on what you *can't* control. Try shifting your focus to what you *can* control – your actions, your reactions, your choices in this very moment. Even if it's just choosing to get out of bed instead of staying there.\n\nFinding your values is a longer process, but you can start by paying attention to what makes you feel angry or inspired. What injustices bother you? What kind of people do you admire? Those clues can point you in the right direction.\n\nAnd finally, about fear... everyone's afraid of something. The key is to not let fear dictate your life. Start by identifying your biggest fear, then break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What's the smallest thing you can do to confront that fear, even just a little bit?\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate the small victories, and remember that even tiny steps forward are still progress. You got this.\n"

Start with just 10-15 minutes of practice each day. Consistency is key, and even short sessions can make a big difference over time. Also, try to connect with other guitar learners or join a community online. Sharing progress and challenges with others can be really motivating. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs—what matters is getting back up and keeping at it. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Learning guitar is a great goal, and it's completely normal for discipline to fluctuate - what matters is that you're ready to rebuild it. Start small by committing to just 10 minutes of practice each day at the same time, perhaps right after breakfast or before bed. The key is consistency over intensity. Once those 10 minutes become automatic (usually takes about 2-3 weeks), gradually increase the duration.\n\nSet up your practice space so your guitar is easily visible and accessible - having to dig it out of a closet creates unnecessary friction. Track your practice sessions in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar or using a habit tracking app. This gives you a visual reminder of your progress and helps maintain momentum.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. If you miss a day, just pick up again the next day without beating yourself up. Focus on the process rather than results, and celebrate small wins like learning a new chord or completing your daily practice, no matter how brief.\n\nWhat specific aspect of guitar playing interests you most? Having a clear, achievable goal (like learning a particular song) can help maintain motivation while you rebuild your discipline.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's great that you've acknowledged your dissatisfaction with your current situation. Learning to play the guitar is a fantastic hobby, but it can also be challenging, especially if you're trying to rebuild your discipline. One strategy that might help is to set extremely small, achievable goals for yourself each day, like practicing a single chord or scale for 5-10 minutes. This can help you build momentum and get back into the habit of regular practice. Additionally, try to focus on the process of learning and improving, rather than being too hard on yourself about not being where you want to be. Celebrate your tiny wins, and use those as motivation to keep moving forward. What's been the most challenging part of learning guitar for you so far, and how do you think you can apply that discipline to other areas of your life?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it happens! Going from one extreme to another is pretty common when you're trying to learn something new. Don't beat yourself up too much.\n\nSince you're learning guitar, maybe try setting super small, achievable goals each day. Like, literally just \"hold the guitar for 5 minutes\" or \"play one chord perfectly.\" The point is to build momentum and get back into the habit of practicing *something* every day. Even if it feels ridiculously easy, those small wins can help you break out of the zero discipline cycle.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you lost your discipline. Did you burn out? Get frustrated? Identifying the trigger can help you avoid it in the future. Maybe you were practicing too much, or maybe you weren't enjoying the songs you were learning. Adjust your approach to make it more sustainable and fun. Good luck!\n"

It was a 1-year relationship, and she was my first true love ever. I really wanted us to work so badly, but it didn't happen. It was a \"healthy\" breakup, but I just couldn't accept it. She wanted us to stay \"friends,\" but I said no. Even if it hurt me so fucking bad. The thing is that I felt safe during her. I showed too much emotion. I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore. I don't want to be famous and get easily affected by my emotions. I want to know how to control my mind and my emotions so people can rely on me in the future.

You're just human.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. Breakups can be really tough, and it's normal to feel lost afterward. The good news is that you can definitely work on building mental and physical strength, and it all starts with small, consistent steps.\n\nFor mental discipline, try starting with mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and learn to manage them better. Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal. It could be as basic as a daily walk or a short workout routine. Exercise is a powerful way to boost your mood and build resilience.\n\nRemember, it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable. It's part of being human. The key is learning how to balance them and not let them control you. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey man, going through a tough breakup is rough, but it's good that you're looking to grow from this experience. Being vulnerable and showing emotions isn't a weakness - it takes real strength to be open with someone. That said, I understand wanting to build better emotional regulation.\n\nStart with small, consistent practices that help you develop mental toughness. Exercise is incredibly effective for this - even just 15 minutes of daily bodyweight exercises will build both physical and mental resilience. When you push through those last few pushups even when your arms are shaking, you're training your mind as much as your body.\n\nFor emotional control, meditation is your friend. Download a free app like Insight Timer and start with just 5 minutes each morning. It teaches you to observe your emotions without being controlled by them. Over time, you'll notice yourself responding to situations rather than reacting.\n\nKeep a simple journal where you track your daily habits and reflect on your progress. Writing helps process emotions in a healthy way while keeping you focused on growth.\n\nRemember that being reliable doesn't mean being emotionless - it means having the strength to handle emotions productively. Take it one day at a time, focus on these foundational habits, and you'll gradually build the mental toughness you're looking for.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your weaknesses and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking the first step. Controlling your emotions and building mental toughness is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. One thing you could start with is developing a daily routine that includes physical exercise, meditation, or journaling - these activities can help you clear your mind, release tension, and gain clarity on your thoughts and feelings. It's also important to set small, achievable goals for yourself and work towards them, which can help build confidence and a sense of control. As for emotional vulnerability, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but learning to balance it with emotional regulation can be helpful. You might find it useful to read up on stoicism or emotional intelligence, as these topics can provide valuable insights on how to manage your emotions and develop a stronger sense of self. Remember that it's okay to feel lost, and it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to figure everything out right now. Just focus on making progress, and be kind to yourself along the way.",

It's good you recognized that staying \"friends\" wouldn't have been healthy for you.\n\nAs for getting more disciplined and in control of your emotions, it's a journey, not a switch you can flip. A good starting point is focusing on small, achievable goals. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once.\n\nThink about one or two areas where you want to improve. Maybe it's hitting the gym a few times a week, learning a new skill, or even just consistently making your bed every morning. The key is consistency. When you start seeing yourself stick to these small commitments, it builds confidence and momentum.\n\nAlso, consider exploring mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and how you react to them. There are tons of free apps and resources online to get you started.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to seek professional help if you're really struggling. A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your emotions and build healthier coping mechanisms. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help. You got this!\n"

That way you can see how many hours you studied each month & the time of the day when are the most productive. \n\nYou said that you can't study everyday because you don't think you can maintain that habit for a long time. In that case, you need to tell yourself that you neither have to study everyday, nor you have to study the same number of hours everyday. You don't have to maintain a streak of the most number of days you studied at a stretch. \n\nWhat you need to do instead is to fix the number of chapters you are gonna read in one week and the number of hours you'll give in total for that entire week. \n\nThat way your goal won't be to study, say, 4 hours a day for 7 days a week to complete 5 chapters in a week. Your goal will actually be something like studying 3 chapters for a total of 15 hours in one week. So someday you'll study for 4 hour, some day you'll study for 2, some day you'll study nothing at all but at the end of the week you would have studied for 15 hours in total. And you would have completed your goal of 3 chapters.\n\nSure this method might mean you maybe studying less than what you thought you could have. But atleast it won't give you anxiety and you'll atleast get something done rather than nothing done at all because you were feeling under confident. \n\nFocus on the sum total. Don't focus on the streak you maintained.\n\nYou said you just don't think you can study a book of 800 pages, no matter how small you break down your goals.\nHere's where you have to lie to yourself. Tell yourself that you can. Wake up everyday and tell yourself that you are capable of completing a 800 page book if you broke it down into reasonable number of pages everyday. Tell yourself that you see no reason why that's impossible. You can do it and you will. You gotta \"Fake it till you make it\". Up until now your brain has been constantly telling you that you can't do it. And it didn't even bother to give you reason why. But you'll give it a reason OP. You will tell yourself that you believe in yourself and hence you'll complete that book of 800 pages. \n\n\nPeople think that you are smart but you think you aren't. You think maybe it's because you are subconsciously projecting that you are smart. Alright then, maybe ever since you left school for college, you really are not that smart anymore. You said so yourself, didn't you? \n\nBut since these college mates still think that you are smart even though you think you aren't, even though you are just pretending to be smart then I guess maybe you are less smart than what they think you are but you are definitely more smart than you think you are. \n\nOP you just need to trick your mind into being your bitch. Stop letting it control you. You start controlling it. Tell it whatever it needs to hear to get it working for you. Trick it, lie to it, comfort it with truth, comfort it with lies & fake confidence. Do whatever you can but remember that you will talk to your mind and you won't let it talk back to you.

Celebrate small wins to build confidence.\n\n2. **Active Learning**: Try different study methods like summarizing what you read in your own words, teaching the material to someone else, or using flashcards. This can make studying more engaging and less draining.\n\n3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Start with very achievable goals to build momentum. Even 10-15 minutes of focused study can be a good start. Gradually increase as you get more comfortable.\n\n4. **Routine and Environment**: Create a study routine and find a study environment that minimizes distractions. Sometimes a change of scenery can help refresh your mind.\n\n5. **Mindset Shift**: Remember, intelligence isn't fixed. It's okay to struggle; it doesn't define your worth or potential. Focus on progress, not perfection.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Talk to classmates or professors.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there. Your situation is really common among college students, especially in technical fields. Let's break this down into manageable pieces.\n\nFirst, forget about the 800 pages for a moment. That number is overwhelming you before you even start. Instead, think of it as learning concepts and building understanding, not memorizing pages.\n\nFor the energy drain you feel when opening textbooks - try this: Start with just 25 minutes of focused study using the Pomodoro technique. Set a timer, put your phone in another room, and just work on understanding one small concept. After the 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. This helps prevent that overwhelming feeling of staring at endless pages.\n\nAbout your confidence - success builds confidence, not the other way around. Start tracking small wins. Even if you only study for 25 minutes today, that's better than 0 minutes. Write it down. Tomorrow, try for two 25-minute sessions. Keep a log of these small victories.\n\nFor remembering content: Try active recall instead of passive reading. After each study session, close the book and write down everything you remember about what you just learned. Make connections to real-world applications or things you already know. This makes the material stick better than trying to memorize word-for-word.\n\nThe \"smart guy\" image - lots of smart people struggle academically. Intelligence and academic performance aren't the same thing. What matters is developing effective study habits, which is a skill anyone can learn.\n\nStart today. Not with 800 pages, not with an ambitious schedule. Just one 25-minute session. Then tomorrow, do it again. Build from there. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're facing a mix of self-doubt, overwhelm, and procrastination. First, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of focusing on remembering 800 pages, try to set daily or weekly targets for a specific number of pages or concepts you want to grasp. This will make the task less daunting and allow you to build momentum.\n\nRegarding your confidence issue, it might help to reframe your thinking. Instead of \"why study if I'll just give up later,\" tell yourself \"I'll start with one day at a time, and see how far I can go.\" Celebrate small wins, even if it's just studying for 30 minutes without getting distracted.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention feeling like you're deceiving people by projecting yourself as smart. Maybe it's time to let go of that image and focus on your actual strengths and weaknesses. You don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to ask for help or admit when you're struggling.\n\nLastly, the feeling of energy drain when looking at theory pages might be due to burnout or lack of interest. Try to find ways to make studying more engaging, like creating concept maps, making flashcards, or discussing topics with classmates.\n\nRemember, building discipline and habits takes time, and it's normal to face setbacks. Don't give up on your goals, but instead, focus on progress, not perfection. You got this, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",

It's super common to feel overwhelmed in college, especially with a demanding program like BTech IT.\n\nFirst off, ditch the \"smart af\" pressure. It's okay to not be the top of the class, and honestly, everyone struggles sometimes. Comparing yourself to others is a motivation killer. Focus on your own progress.\n\nAbout the 800 pages – that's a HUGE mental block. Instead of thinking about the whole thing, break it down even smaller than you are now. Forget 2-5 pages. Aim for *one paragraph*. Seriously. Just one. Read it, understand it, and then summarize it in your own words. Do that for one paragraph, and then stop. If you feel like doing another, great. If not, you still accomplished something. The key is consistency, not quantity, especially at the beginning.\n\nAlso, that \"energy drain\" when you see the textbook? Totally relatable. Try changing your study environment. Go to a coffee shop, the library, or even just a different room in your house. Experiment with what works. Maybe try studying with a friend, even if you're not working on the exact same thing. Just having someone else around can help with motivation.\n\nFinally, about the confidence thing: celebrate the small wins. Did you read that one paragraph? Awesome! Did you make it to the library? Great! Acknowledge those little victories. They add up over time and build momentum. Don't beat yourself up for \"relapses.\" Just get back on track as soon as you can. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

        "best_comment": "I've finally managed to break my bad sleep habits. Here's how:\n\n1. Start preparing for bed in advance of your bedtime. For example, if you want to go to bed at 10:30, set an alarm 1 hour to start doing bedtime routines. So at 9:30 you shower, brush teeth, start dimming/turning off lights, get stuff ready for tomorrow, etc.\n2. Immediately stop using cellphone or computers at this alarm time as well. This period is your bedtime preparation phase and planning for tomorrow phase, nothing else.\n3. Use settings in your smartphone which make the phone almost unusable at this cutoff time. Android has sleep routines. In this routine you can set it to automatically make the screen black and white and limit app usage. Use this. It's powerful. Then charge your phone at night far away from you in an ugly place. I put my phone on the floor at the other end of the room. Never on the nightstand.\n4. Throughout the day, think ahead about your bedtime routine. Nothing happens spontaneously, including sleep. By thinking throughout the day, you mentally **prepare that your day will definitely end at this 9:30 cutoff and you must complete your tasks before then.**\n5. Start at an easier bedtime and start pushing it back more and more as the habit gets stronger. Now I could make myself wake up at 5 AM easily daily if I wanted to just by changing when I start my bedtime prep routine.\n6. Once you get the basics you can start to make the sleep routine enjoyable. Throw in things that are calming but not cellphone or computer related. Drink tea, write goals, write in a journal, etc within that hour.\n\nIf you find your mind racing while in bed, get out a pen and paper and write about the thoughts for a few minutes.

This helps regulate your body's internal clock.\n\n2. **Wind Down Routine**: Create a relaxing pre-sleep routine. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or doing some light stretching. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed as the blue light can interfere with your sleep.\n\n3. **Limit Caffeine and Heavy Meals**: Try to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and keep heavy meals a few hours before bedtime.\n\n4. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, a cool room temperature, and minimal noise and light.\n\n5. **Morning Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure in the morning. This can help reset your circadian rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep at night.\n\n6. **Exercise Regularly**: Since you want to work out in the morning, try to stick with it.

A white noise machine can also help if you're used to different ambient sounds from your previous location.\n\nThe morning routine is just as important. As soon as your alarm goes off, expose yourself to bright light - open curtains, turn on lights, or step outside. This helps reset your body clock. Even if you don't work out right away, getting that light exposure will help tremendously.\n\nDon't try to change everything at once. Start by shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier every few days until you reach your target time. Your current 6.5 hours is a good foundation to build from. Remember that consistency matters more than perfection - it's better to maintain a regular schedule than to yo-yo between \"perfect\" days and late nights.",
        "llama_comment": "Hey, changing your sleep schedule can be tough, especially when you're used to a different environment. First, it's great that you've already improved your sleep to 6.5 hours a night - that's a good foundation to build on. To develop a regular sleeping pattern, I'd suggest starting by setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. Establishing a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to sleep - this could be something like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. \n\nSince you want to start working out in the morning, try setting your alarm for a realistic wake-up time and get some morning sunlight exposure as soon as you wake up - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results, it takes time for your body to adjust to a new sleep schedule. You might also consider keeping a sleep diary to track your progress and identify any patterns or triggers that affect your sleep. Lastly, try to create a sleep-conducive environment - make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, and invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. Good luck, and don't give up - developing new habits takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get the struggle! Shifting sleep schedules is tough, especially with work and a climate change. Here's what's helped me:\n\nFirst, consistency is key. Even on weekends, try to wake up and go to bed within an hour of your weekday schedule. It really helps regulate your body clock.\n\nSecond, light exposure. Since you're aiming for early workouts, try to get some sunlight first thing in the morning. It signals to your body that it's time to be awake. If it's still dark out, a light therapy lamp can help.\n\nThird, wind-down routine. An hour before bed, dim the lights, put away screens, and do something relaxing like reading or taking a warm bath. Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.\n\nFourth, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just get back on track the next day. Small improvements consistently applied are way more effective than trying to make huge changes overnight.\n\nFinally, regarding the climate thing, it's easy to find excuses. Maybe it *is* a factor, but don't let it be a roadblock. Focus on what you *can* control. Good luck!\n"

Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes and commit to working on the task for that short period. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it becomes easier to keep going. Also, consider the \"2-minute rule\" where if something takes less than 2 minutes to do, just do it immediately. This can help train your brain to act quickly and reduce the mental resistance. Lastly, remind yourself of the benefits of getting things done early, like reduced stress and more free time later. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Your brain is actually doing what brains are designed to do - avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. But here's the thing: that immediate comfort comes at the cost of much bigger discomfort later (stress, rushed work, missed opportunities).\n\nTry reframing it this way: doing things immediately IS the comfortable choice. When you tackle something right away, you get to enjoy the rest of your time truly stress-free, knowing it's handled. That peace of mind is worth way more than the brief comfort of delay.\n\nStart small. Next time you have a task, try the \"just 2 minutes\" approach. Tell yourself you'll work on it for just 2 minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll find it's not nearly as uncomfortable as your brain predicted, and you'll want to keep going. Even if you don't, that's 2 minutes of progress you didn't have before.\n\nThe motivation you're waiting for? It usually comes AFTER you start, not before. Action creates motivation, not the other way around. Each time you push through and do something immediately, you're training your brain to recognize that the discomfort is temporary but the rewards are lasting.\n\nRemember: Future You is still You. By doing things now, you're basically giving a gift to yourself - the gift of not having to deal with it later when it's more urgent and stressful.",
        "llama_comment": "I think what you're describing is a pretty common struggle - our brains are wired to avoid discomfort, and procrastination can be a major obstacle. One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around the idea that it's not about feeling motivated, but about building discipline. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try telling yourself that you're going to take action for a set amount of time, say 25 minutes, and then you can take a break. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, you might want to consider identifying the underlying reasons why you're procrastinating - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to address those specific issues. Lastly, remind yourself that the feeling of discomfort is usually temporary, and the sense of accomplishment you'll get from taking action will often outweigh the initial struggle.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is wired to seek comfort first, and anything that feels like a struggle gets pushed aside.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is to reframe \"doing things immediately\" as not a huge, overwhelming task, but as a series of tiny, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, if you need to do laundry, don't think \"I need to do all the laundry.\" Think \"I need to gather the dirty clothes from the floor.\" That's it. Once you've done that, the next step (starting the washing machine) feels a lot less daunting.\n\nAlso, try to focus on the *relief* you'll feel once the task is done, not the discomfort of starting. Visualize that feeling of accomplishment and freedom from having it hanging over your head. It's a much more powerful motivator than trying to argue with the \"comfort now\" part of your brain.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to procrastinate sometimes. The key is to not let it become a habit. When you catch yourself doing it, acknowledge it, and then try one of these strategies to get moving. Good luck!\n"

Also, pay attention to your diet and hydration; sometimes fatigue can be linked to what we eat and drink.\n\nLastly, gentle exercise like walking or stretching can boost your energy levels.

The level of fatigue you're describing, especially the sudden change from being able to handle a full school day to struggling after 3 hours, suggests there might be an underlying health issue that needs addressing.\n\nFirst step: Please try to see a doctor. This could be related to various treatable conditions like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, sleep disorders, or other medical conditions. Your symptoms are real and deserve proper medical attention, regardless of what others might think.\n\nIn the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your energy:\n\nTrack your sleep patterns and fatigue levels in a simple diary. Note when you feel most tired and any patterns you notice. This information will be valuable for your doctor and might help you identify triggers.\n\nLook at your diet - make sure you're getting enough protein, complex carbs, and staying hydrated. Sometimes excessive sugar or processed foods can contribute to energy crashes.\n\nTry to get some light exercise, even just a 10-minute walk outside each day. It seems counterintuitive when you're tired, but gentle movement can actually help boost energy levels.\n\nBreak your work into smaller chunks. Instead of trying to power through long sessions, try 15-20 minute focused periods with short breaks. This might help you manage your work-from-home job more effectively.\n\nMost importantly, don't blame yourself.

It's possible that there's an underlying issue that needs attention, and a professional can provide guidance on whether your sleep patterns and lifestyle are contributing to your exhaustion.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to try breaking down your day into smaller, manageable tasks to help conserve energy. For example, instead of trying to work for long stretches, take regular short breaks to stretch, move around, and rest your eyes. This can help reduce burnout and make your work-from-home job more sustainable. Additionally, consider establishing a consistent daily routine that includes time for physical activity, socializing, and relaxation - sometimes, fatigue can be exacerbated by a lack of balance in our lives.\n\nIt's also important to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about how you're feeling.

Fatigue like that can be a symptom of a lot of things – vitamin deficiencies (like iron or vitamin D), thyroid issues, sleep disorders, or even something like mono.

Don't try to overhaul everything at once, or you'll likely get overwhelmed.\n\nStart with hydration. Dehydration can make you feel super tired. Aim for consistent water intake throughout the day. Next, look at your diet. Are you eating a lot of processed foods or sugary drinks? Try swapping those out for whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Even small changes can make a difference.\n\nFor your work-from-home job, break down your tasks into smaller chunks. Instead of thinking \"I have to work for hours,\" tell yourself \"I'm going to work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break to stretch or walk around.\" The Pomodoro Technique can be really helpful for this.

Whether it's reading, going for a walk, or picking up a hobby, find something that can replace the time you used to spend on your phone.\n\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: When you feel those uneasy feelings, take a few deep breaths and try to focus on the present moment. Mindfulness can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more grounded.\n\n4. **Reward yourself**: Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. This can help reinforce the positive behavior and make the process more enjoyable.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to feel uncomfortable. You're doing great by sticking with it, and it will get easier with time. Keep pushing forward!",
        "claude_comment": "What you're experiencing is totally normal when making big changes to your habits. Those uncomfortable feelings are your brain adjusting to a new pattern - like muscles being sore after starting to exercise.\n\nInstead of going cold turkey, try scaling back gradually. Set a timer for 30-minute focused work sessions with 5-minute phone breaks in between. This will help reduce that anxious feeling while still moving you toward your goals. As you get more comfortable, you can extend the work periods and shorten the breaks.\n\nFor the physical symptoms like heart palpitations, try some deep breathing exercises. Take 5 slow breaths, counting to 4 as you inhale and 4 as you exhale. This can help calm your nervous system when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nRemember that building discipline is a marathon, not a sprint. Small consistent steps forward are much better than trying to change everything overnight and burning out. You've already shown great initiative by deciding to make this change - now give yourself permission to progress at a sustainable pace.\n\nKeep going! The discomfort will decrease as your brain adapts to these new patterns.",
        "llama_comment": "It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable when you're making a significant change like this, especially after being used to a certain routine for so long. Your body and mind are essentially going through withdrawal from the constant dopamine hits you were getting from your phone. The fact that you've made it 2 hours without touching your phone is a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself for taking the first step. \n\nOne thing that might help with the uneasy feeling and heart palpitations is to take some deep breaths and focus on the physical sensations in your body. Sometimes, our minds can get ahead of us and make us feel like we're struggling more than we actually are. Try to ground yourself in the present moment and remind yourself why you wanted to make this change in the first place. It's also a good idea to have a plan for how you want to use your time productively, so you can focus on that instead of feeling restless. \n\nRemember, it's okay to feel uncomfortable, and it doesn't mean you're failing or that you should give up. It just means your body is adjusting to a new way of being, and that takes time. You've got this, and you can make it through the rest of the day. Keep pushing forward, and I'm sure you'll start to feel more comfortable as you get into a rhythm.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, congrats on taking the first step! It's totally normal to feel uncomfortable when you break old habits, especially something like phone use. Think of it like quitting sugar – your body craves what it's used to.\n\nA couple of things that might help: First, don't go cold turkey *completely*. Maybe schedule specific phone breaks, like 15 minutes every few hours, so it's not a total deprivation. Second, focus on *replacing* the phone time with something engaging. What are you being productive *with*? If you're just sitting there \"not using your phone,\" it's gonna be tough. Find an activity you enjoy, even if it's just a little bit, and dive into that. The discomfort will fade as you get more absorbed. Finally, remember it's a process. Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just get back on track. You got this!\n"

I've started with common things like no social media, no random searching on the internet, no youtube, not using phone (just using twice, once in the morning and once at night just to check mails, read some good posts on reddit etc.), no music (I don't watch movies and shows that much so thats already in control). \n\nProblem is while I study or work on something else as well, I feel sleepy, a lot. This problem is concerning because I have a healthy diet, and sleep for atleast 6-7 hours at night (usually I go to bed around 12), yet....\n\nPreviously in my old routine, I used to just put on the headphones and listen to music while working.

However, after switching to a new dentist, it was discovered that I had a mild case of gingivitis (the dental professionals will need to correct my terminology).\n\nLong story short, it was explained to me that my body uses energy to fight off the infection of gingivitis, constantly; and that chronic fatigue is a consequence.

        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're making some great strides with your dopamine detox, but the sleepiness is definitely a hurdle. Here are a few things you might try: \n\n1. **Adjust Your Sleep Schedule**: Even though you're getting 6-7 hours, you might need a bit more. Try going to bed earlier and see if that helps. Everyone's sleep needs are different, and sometimes just an extra hour can make a big difference.\n\n2. **Take Short Breaks**: Implement the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and prevent that sleepy feeling.\n\n3. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes, feeling sleepy can be a sign of dehydration. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n4. **Natural Light and Fresh Air**: Try to study near a window or take short walks outside. Natural light and fresh air can be invigorating and help keep you alert.\n\n5. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some light exercise into your routine. Even a quick 10-minute workout can boost your energy levels.\n\n6. **Mindful Music**: If music helped you before, consider using instrumental or ambient music that won't distract you but can keep your mind engaged.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding what works best for you. Keep experimenting with small changes until you find the right balance. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Your sleepiness might actually be related to your sleep schedule rather than just the dopamine detox. While 6-7 hours can work for some people, most adults need 7-9 hours, and going to bed at midnight can throw off your natural circadian rhythm. Try shifting your bedtime earlier (like 10:30 PM) and aim for 8 hours of sleep consistently.\n\nFor staying alert while studying without music, there are several effective strategies you can try. Take short breaks every 45-50 minutes and do some light exercise - even just walking around the room or doing jumping jacks can help. Keep your study space well-lit and slightly cool. Staying hydrated is also crucial - sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration.\n\nYou might also consider breaking up longer study sessions into smaller chunks with different activities. For example, alternate between reading, writing, and problem-solving. This variety can help maintain alertness without relying on external stimulation like music.\n\nIf you really miss the background noise, try white noise or nature sounds instead of music - they can provide ambient sound without the dopamine hit that comes from actual songs. You could gradually phase these out as you adjust to studying in silence.\n\nRemember that it's normal to feel some fatigue while your brain adjusts to less stimulation. Give yourself at least a few weeks to adapt to this new routine. The sleepiness should improve as your body and mind adjust to the lower baseline of stimulation.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're taking proactive steps with your dopamine detox and recognizing the challenges that come with it. The sleepiness you're experiencing could be due to a few factors, such as your brain adjusting to the lack of constant stimulation or possibly even a sign of mental fatigue from focusing intensely without breaks. One strategy you might consider is incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to help increase your energy levels and alertness. Additionally, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between, allowing yourself time to rest and recharge. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique and can be really helpful in maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. It might also be worth experimenting with your sleep schedule, trying to go to bed a bit earlier to see if that improves the quality of your sleep and subsequently your alertness during the day. Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you, so don't be afraid to tweak your routine as needed until you find what helps you stay focused and energized.",

Feeling sleepy while studying after making these changes is a pretty common issue, so don't get discouraged.\n\nSince you've cut out music, your brain is probably missing that stimulation. Instead of going back to music, maybe try incorporating other ways to keep yourself alert. Have you considered things like:\n\n*   **Short breaks with physical activity?** Even a quick walk or some jumping jacks can make a difference.\n*   **Adjusting your study environment?** Make sure you have good lighting and a comfortable but not *too* comfortable chair. A slightly cooler room temperature can also help.\n*   **Trying different study techniques?** Maybe the way you're studying is just boring you. Experiment with active recall, spaced repetition, or the Feynman technique.\n*   **Hydration and snacks?** Dehydration can cause fatigue, and a healthy snack can provide a quick energy boost. Think fruits, nuts, or yogurt.\n*   **Timing?** Maybe the time you study is the problem. Try studying at different times of the day when you feel more alert.\n\nAlso, 6-7 hours of sleep might not be enough for you. Everyone's different. Experiment with getting closer to 8 hours to see if that helps. And make sure that sleep is quality sleep – a dark, quiet room, and no screens before bed.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. It takes time for your brain to adjust to a new routine. Keep experimenting and you'll find what works best for you. Good luck!\n"

I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - \n\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \n\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\n\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?",

Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\n\nI can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option.

Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH).

This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.\n\n3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there's a way to manage it better. It's important to have time for yourself outside of work.\n\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.\n\n5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor.

        "claude_comment": "First off, working 12-hour days while WFH isn't sustainable - no wonder you're living for the weekends. This isn't what the next 35-40 years needs to look like, and there are several ways to make positive changes.\n\nStart by setting firm boundaries at work. Block your calendar for breaks, log off at a consistent time, and communicate your availability clearly to colleagues. Your mental health and performance will both improve with better work-life balance.\n\nInstead of viewing weekdays as something to \"get through,\" try building small things to look forward to throughout the week. Maybe it's a Monday evening hobby class, Wednesday lunch with a friend, or Thursday morning workout. These anchor points make weekdays more meaningful and break up the monotony.\n\nFor the food and sleep issues - they're connected to your current lifestyle. When we're stressed and unfulfilled during the week, we tend to seek comfort in food and sleep. Rather than fighting your body to get up, try going to bed earlier and establishing a proper morning routine. Even 15 minutes of morning activity (stretching, brief walk, reading) can shift your mindset for the day ahead.\n\nConsider finding a physical activity you enjoy and scheduling it 2-3 times during the week. Exercise helps regulate mood, sleep, and eating patterns, plus gives you something productive to focus on besides work.\n\nThe goal isn't to make weekdays as exciting as weekends, but to create a sustainable rhythm where each day has its own value. Start with one small change this week - whether that's setting a work boundary, adding a weekday activity, or establishing a morning routine. Build from there gradually.\n\nRemember that feeling stuck isn't the same as being stuck. You have more control over your daily experience than it might feel like right now.",

First, I want to acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. One thing that might help is to try to find small things to look forward to during the week, even if it's just something as simple as a favorite lunch or a short walk outside during your break. This can help break up the monotony of the weekdays and give you something to focus on besides just counting down to Friday. \n\nIt might also be helpful to set some boundaries around your work hours, since you mentioned you're working 9-9 and feeling overwhelmed. Could you try setting a specific \"shutdown\" time for work each day, and then do something you enjoy in the evening to signal to yourself that work is over? This could be reading, drawing, or anything else that helps you relax and feel like you're not still \"on the clock\".\n\nIn terms of respecting each day equally, it might be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than always looking ahead to the weekend. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can help with this. It's also worth considering what specific things are making your weekdays feel so boring or unfulfilling - is it the work itself, the lack of social interaction, something else? Once you identify what's missing, you might be able to find ways to address those needs and make the weekdays more enjoyable.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're aware of how your current habits are affecting your mental and physical health. Have you considered seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of these issues? They might be able to provide additional guidance and support as you try to make these changes. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Just start with small, manageable changes and see how they stick.",

It sounds like you're stuck in a rut, but definitely not an unfixable one.\n\nFirst, about accepting the next 35-40 years... don't! That's a recipe for misery. Instead of thinking of it as one long, monotonous stretch, break it down. What small, achievable goals can you set for the next month, the next quarter, the next year? These don't have to be huge career leaps, but things that add meaning and enjoyment to your life *outside* of work. Maybe it's learning a new skill, exploring a hobby, or volunteering.\n\nSecond, tackle the weekday misery. Since you're WFH, can you carve out specific \"work hours\" and stick to them? Even if it means shutting down your computer at 5 or 6 pm, even if you haven't finished everything. It's about setting boundaries. Also, try to incorporate small joys into your weekdays. A walk during lunch, listening to a podcast while you work, or even just making a really good cup of coffee.\n\nThird, address the food coping mechanism. This is tough, but awareness is the first step. Instead of reaching for food when you're stressed or sad, try to identify the trigger and find a healthier alternative. Maybe it's calling a friend, doing some light exercise, or practicing mindfulness. Start small, like replacing one unhealthy snack a day with something better.\n\nFinally, the sleep inertia. Instead of just lying there, try to get some sunlight as soon as you wake up. Open the blinds, go for a short walk, or even just sit by a window. The light helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\nIt's all about small, consistent changes. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one or two things to focus on, and build from there. You got this!\n"

Set aside just 30 minutes each day for focused study - no phone, no distractions. Use the Pomodoro technique if it helps (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break).\n\nFor the schedule challenges with chaotic college life, try working backwards. Rather than creating a rigid hour-by-hour plan, identify your non-negotiables for each day (classes, exam prep, basic self-care) and build around those. Keep it flexible enough to accommodate unexpected changes.\n\nThe escapism activities aren't inherently bad - they're coping mechanisms.

I got through high school one way or another with luck, but now I'm at uni and I can't go into tests without studying anymore. I feel it's hard to start, when I've already started I can go ahead and do a lot, but actually getting up and opening my laptop/books is really hard.. I'm diagnosed with ADD and I've heard other people also struggle with this.\n\nAnyone who also has these issues/has some advice? Thanks",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "Plan to open your book or laptop as if you're going to study. Once you've opened it you're allowed to study or close it again immediately if you want. After you've done this a few times (for example, just before each meal), it will be easier. Then you can plan something bigger, like studying for at least 1 minute, or at least 5 minutes, etc. Pretty soon you'll be studying.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! Dealing with ADD and trying to build discipline can definitely be challenging, but you're not alone in this. One strategy that might help is breaking your study sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks. Try using the Pomodoro Technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can make starting feel less overwhelming and help maintain focus. Also, consider creating a dedicated study space that's free from distractions, and set specific times for studying to build a routine. Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to your university's support services; they often have resources and accommodations that can make a big difference. Keep at it, and remember that progress is progress, no matter how small!",
        "claude_comment": "Starting is often the hardest part, especially with ADD - you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Since you mentioned you can work well once you actually begin, let's focus on making that initial push easier.\n\nTry breaking down the \"starting\" phase into tiny steps. Instead of thinking \"I need to study,\" make it \"I just need to sit at my desk.\" Then \"I just need to open my laptop.\" Each micro-step feels more manageable.\n\nA technique that works well for many people with ADD is the \"5-minute rule.\" Promise yourself you'll work for just 5 minutes. That's it. Usually, once those 5 minutes are up, you'll naturally want to continue since you've already overcome the activation energy hurdle.\n\nSetting up your environment can make a huge difference too. Keep your study space clean and organized. Put your books/laptop in plain sight before going to bed. Remove obvious distractions like your phone from the area. The easier you make it to start, the more likely you'll do it.\n\nConsider using the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. Knowing there's a break coming up soon can make starting feel less daunting.\n\nRemember that building discipline is like building muscle - it takes consistent practice and gets easier over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate the wins when you successfully get started.",
        "llama_comment": "I totally get where you're coming from - it's like there's a huge hurdle to overcome just to get started. One strategy that might help is breaking down your study sessions into super small, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking \"I need to study for hours,\" try telling yourself \"I'll work on this one problem/set of notes for 10 minutes.\" Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've made a tiny bit of progress, you can build momentum from there. Additionally, consider using the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help make studying feel less overwhelming and allow you to take advantage of your ability to focus once you're engaged. It might also be helpful to identify a specific \"starting ritual\" that signals to your brain that it's time to study, like making a cup of coffee or doing a quick exercise routine. Have you talked to your uni about any accommodations or support services they might offer for students with ADD? They may have some additional resources or strategies that can help you succeed.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. ADD definitely throws a wrench into the whole discipline thing, especially when it comes to starting tasks. What's helped me is breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of \"study for history,\" it's \"open history book\" or even just \"put history book on desk.\" Seriously, make the initial step so easy it's almost impossible to say no to.\n\nAnother thing that works for me is using the Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Knowing there's a break coming up helps me stay on track. There are tons of apps and timers for this.\n\nAlso, try to figure out *why* you're avoiding starting. Is it boring? Too overwhelming? If it's boring, can you make it more interesting somehow? Maybe study with a friend or listen to music (if it doesn't distract you too much). If it's overwhelming, break it down into even smaller chunks.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect, and that's okay. Just keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!\n"

        "best_comment": "One thing I will say is a lot of things that you seem to be beating yourself for, are the same types of problems that you’ll find in a lot of people. I know it feels like you’re alone in your struggles but you are not.\n\nAlso, while reading this, it’s seems like you are demanding a lot of yourself and punishing yourself when you don’t meet those standards. First thing, I’d say is to focus more on being more gentle with yourself. It’s ok to have desires but try to stray away from the “do or die” mindset and just focus on thinking of it more optimistically. Don’t think “I have to do this or x will happen” but more “If I do this, x will happen”. \n\nTrain yourself to do that everyday and you’ll see change eventually. You’ll be looking at your life with a healthier perspective and your desires will naturally be answered because of that. Patience and perseverance is key though. Take it day by day, and don’t tell yourself that you are running out of time, as long as you are working towards what you want to accomplish in the present moment, you have time.",

I didn’t understand me cuz I couldn’t feel me. And I couldn’t feel me because it was unbearable. \n\nMaybe it’s today. Maybe it’s five years from now. (A therapist or close friend can definitely help expedite the process.) One day you feel your feels. Pat yourself on the back if you do. This is called emotional processing and it’s necessary to heal but it doesn’t need to be rushed.\n\nYou’ll be okay.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to commend you for reaching out. That's a big step in itself. Here are a few thoughts that might help you start moving forward:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one small habit to work on. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or going for a 5-minute walk. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Try to spend a few minutes each day reflecting on your thoughts and feelings. Journaling can be a great way to get to know yourself better and start identifying what truly matters to you.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide guidance and help you work through these feelings. It's okay to ask for help, and it can make a big difference.\n\n4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break down your goals into manageable steps. Instead of thinking about where you want to be in years, focus on what you can do this week or even today.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and it's okay to have setbacks. Treat yourself with the same kindness and patience you would offer a friend.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there. First, know that what you're experiencing isn't uncommon at 18 - many people struggle with identity and feeling \"real\" at your age. But let's focus on some concrete steps you can take.\n\nStart incredibly small. Your mind is throwing up barriers because you're trying to tackle everything at once. Instead of thinking about becoming a whole different person, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Something so small it seems almost ridiculous - like drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or standing outside for 30 seconds each morning.\n\nThe goal isn't the habit itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on something. Each small win helps quiet that voice of fear and builds evidence that you can change.\n\nFor the gym specifically - don't think about \"becoming a gym person.\" Just focus on putting on your shoes and walking to the door. That's it. If you make it there and turn around, you've still succeeded. Usually once you're there, you'll work out anyway.\n\nAbout finding your core self - values aren't something you discover, they're something you build through actions. Pick one thing that matters to you (could be honesty, kindness, courage - anything) and take one tiny action aligned with it each day. Your identity will develop through what you do, not what you think about.\n\nConsider talking to your college's counseling services when you start - they're usually free for students and can help you develop more tools for managing these feelings.\n\nRemember: change happens through small, consistent actions, not giant transformations. Pick one tiny thing. Do it today. That's enough to start.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you're facing, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from yourself and unsure of how to break free from these patterns that are holding you back. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building self-awareness. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and start with tiny, manageable steps. For example, if you want to work on developing more discipline, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes something as simple as making your bed or taking a short walk. \n\nIt's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's normal for your values and personality to evolve over time. You don't have to have it all figured out at 18 - or even at 35, for that matter. What's important is that you're taking steps towards growth and self-improvement.\n\nIn terms of dealing with fear and ego, it might be helpful to practice some mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment, and give you the space to respond to them in a more intentional way. \n\nLastly, it's great that you're recognizing the importance of seeking help and support. If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can work with you to develop strategies for overcoming these challenges. And don't be too hard on yourself - remember that it's okay to stumble and make mistakes along the way. The fact that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to change is a huge step in the right direction.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and recognizing these patterns is a huge first step. It takes courage to be this honest with yourself.\n\nIt's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you don't have to fix everything at once. Start small. You mentioned the gym – instead of focusing on some massive transformation, could you just commit to putting on your workout clothes and walking around the block? Seriously, that's it. The goal isn't to become a bodybuilder overnight, it's to break the inertia and prove to yourself that you *can* take action.\n\nRegarding feeling like you lack a core self, that's something a lot of people struggle with, especially at 18. Values aren't just things you're born with; they're things you discover and cultivate. Try exploring different ideas and activities. What makes you feel genuinely good, not just momentarily distracted? What kind of person do you *want* to be? Start journaling, even if it's just a few sentences a day. It can help you identify your values and track your progress.\n\nAs for the \"sinful acts\" and lack of control, that's where building habits comes in. It's not about willpower, it's about creating systems. If you know you're prone to certain impulses, identify the triggers and try to avoid them. Replace those impulses with something healthier. For example, if you get the urge to do something you regret, try doing 10 pushups or going for a quick walk instead.\n\nThe patterns you're stuck in? Start by picking *one* small pattern you want to break. Don't try to overhaul your entire life. Just focus on that one thing. When you recognize the pattern starting, consciously choose a different action. It will be uncomfortable, but that's how you create new neural pathways.\n\nCollege is a great opportunity for a fresh start. Join clubs, attend events, and meet new people. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and support your goals.\n\nFinally, if you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a professional. There are people who want to help you, and you don't have to go through this alone. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 988.\n\nYou're not made of stone. You're a work in progress, just like everyone else. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You've got this.\n"

First off, remember that hard work is never wasted; it's all part of the learning process. Here are a few tips that might help you study more efficiently:\n\n1. **Quality over Quantity**: It's not just about the hours you put in but how effectively you use them. Try breaking your study sessions into focused, shorter periods with breaks in between (like the Pomodoro Technique). This can help prevent burnout and improve retention.\n\n2. **Active Learning**: Engage with the material actively. This could mean teaching the concepts to someone else, doing practice questions, or discussing topics with peers. It helps reinforce what you've learned.\n\n3. **Review and Reflect**: After each study session, take a few minutes to review what you've learned and identify any areas that need more attention. This can help you focus your efforts more effectively.\n\n4. **Healthy Habits**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking time to relax. These are crucial for maintaining your energy and focus.\n\n5. **Mindset**: Try to shift your focus from comparing yourself to others to improving your own performance.

        "claude_comment": "First off, working hard isn't always the same as working smart. Studying from 4AM to 11PM is actually counterproductive - your brain needs proper rest to consolidate information and maintain focus.\n\nHere's what you can do differently:\n\nStudy in focused blocks of 25-45 minutes with short breaks between. This is called the Pomodoro Technique and it helps maintain high concentration while preventing burnout. During breaks, step away from your desk, stretch, or get some water.\n\nTest yourself constantly. Don't just read and re-read materials. Use active recall by closing your books and writing down everything you remember about a topic. Take practice tests under exam conditions. This helps identify weak spots and builds confidence.\n\nYour friends who \"didn't study much\" probably had better study strategies or prior knowledge. Don't compare yourself - focus on finding what works for you. Quality beats quantity every time.\n\nCreate a structured study schedule with specific topics for each day, but keep it reasonable - maybe 6-8 hours of actual studying with breaks. Use the remaining time for exercise, proper sleep, and relaxation. Your brain needs this balance to perform well.\n\nStart tracking what study methods give you the best results. Some people learn better by teaching concepts to others, some by drawing mind maps, others by solving problems.

        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure about your study approach after a disappointing exam result. First, let's acknowledge that putting in long hours doesn't always translate to better outcomes, and it's great that you're recognizing the need for a change. \n\nOne potential issue might be the lack of balance and rest in your study routine. While it's impressive that you were waking up at 4AM and studying till 11PM, this kind of schedule can lead to burnout, which can negatively impact your ability to retain information and perform well on exams. It's possible that your friends who seemed to do well with less studying might have been more efficient with their time or had a better understanding of what to focus on.\n\nTo improve, you could try breaking down your study material into manageable chunks, setting specific goals for each study session, and incorporating regular breaks to help you stay focused and retain information better. It might also be helpful to review and adjust your study techniques, such as using active recall, summarizing notes in your own words, or creating concept maps to visualize relationships between ideas.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth considering that luck can play a role in exam performance, but it's unlikely to be the sole reason for your friends' success. They might have had a better understanding of the exam format, been more familiar with the types of questions asked, or simply been more effective at managing their time during the exam.\n\nRather than comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own progress and identify areas where you can improve. You could start by reflecting on what you think went wrong in your previous study approach and what changes you can make to avoid burnout and improve your efficiency. Remember that developing effective study habits takes time and experimentation, so be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to try new approaches until you find what works best for you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about your exam results. It's incredibly frustrating to put in so much effort and not see the outcome you hoped for. It sounds like you're dealing with burnout, and that's a real thing that can seriously impact your performance.\n\nFirst, cut yourself some slack. You clearly have the dedication, waking up at 4 AM is no joke. But dedication without the right strategy can lead to diminishing returns. It's not just about the *quantity* of hours, but the *quality* of your study sessions.\n\nHere's a few things to consider:\n\n*   **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition:** Instead of just passively reading, try testing yourself frequently. Flashcards, practice questions, even just trying to explain concepts out loud from memory. Spaced repetition (reviewing material at increasing intervals) can also help solidify information in your long-term memory.\n*   **Breaks & Rest:** Seriously, this is crucial. Your brain needs time to process and consolidate information. Short breaks every hour (5-10 minutes to stretch, walk around) and a full day off each week can make a huge difference. Sleep is also non-negotiable. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep.\n*   **Study Techniques:** Experiment with different study methods. Mind mapping, the Feynman Technique (teaching the concept to someone else), or even just changing your study environment can help you stay engaged and absorb information better.\n*   **Analyze Your Mistakes:** Don't just brush off the bad score. Go through your past papers and identify *why* you got questions wrong. Was it a lack of understanding, careless errors, or time management issues? Understanding the root cause will help you target your studying more effectively.\n*   **Don't Compare Yourself:** It's easy to get caught up in what your friends are doing, but everyone learns differently. Focus on finding what works best for *you*. Their \"luck\" might just be a different approach that suits them better.\n\nIt's possible your friends have a better grasp of the material with less effort, or they might be overestimating their performance. Either way, focus on your own journey.\n\nFinally, consider talking to a tutor or academic advisor. They can provide personalized feedback on your study habits and help you identify areas for improvement. You've got this! It's a marathon, not a sprint.\n"

      "body": "\n2023 already begun but my mentality of living life has been the same since 2015 and I’m so sick and emotionally tired of it. Taking the first step to self improvement has been a struggle for me. I really feel so anxious and scared to working towards my goals and things I need to work on. Spring semester starts next week and I still haven’t signed up for classes and back of my mind that’s all I worry about. I worry and stress myself so much but I’m not facing my fears. I don’t know what it could be whether it’s anxiety or am I living my life in boundaries and fears. \n\nIt’s so easy for so many people to just do it and not care about the outcome or failure. All they do is just keep pushing forward meanwhile I’m viewing life like birds eye view, wanting to predict the outcome and this thoughts of what if I fail or what I mess up. This constant anxiety and overthinking is holding me back from achieving my goals and living life to the fullest. It’s like I’ve made restrictions and created boundaries in my head. Sometimes I feel like my mind has become a prison",

Take one step, then relax and reward yourself.\n\nAs you start actually doing things, usually the anxiety associated with a given step diminishes. You get used to it.\n\nMake that first step very, very small. Do something every day.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Instead of setting up a big task that you can fail or succeed, set smaller, achievable tasks that you're unlikely to fail.\n\nInstead of  saying 'I'll get perfect marks this semester', say 'on week 1 of school I will study for 20 minutes each day and make sure I finish my assignments for that day'. Even if you skip one day of study, 20 minutes won't make much of a difference on your final grade. But if you do study each day for those 20 minutes, you can be sure you completed that day's task.\n\nI'll set myself as an example. One of my life goals is to run a marathon. The thing is that I've never really done any serious exercise in my life.\n\nSo instead of saying 'I have to run a marathon or else', I said 'I will run for 3 minutes each day for one week', then increased it to 5 minutes and so on and so forth. Eventually, my body adapt and my technique will be enough to do a marathon.\n\nIt's the same with your grades, if you work small tasks diligently, academic success should be within reach.",
        "gpt_comment": "Taking the first step can definitely feel overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with anxiety and overthinking. One thing that might help is breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of focusing on the entire semester, start with just signing up for one class. Once that's done, give yourself a small reward. This can help build momentum and make the process feel less daunting. Also, try to shift your mindset from worrying about failure to viewing each step as a learning opportunity. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right away. Progress, not perfection, is key. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Taking the first step is often the hardest part because our minds can get caught up trying to plan everything perfectly. The truth is, no one can predict all outcomes - even the most successful people face uncertainty and failure regularly.\n\nHere's what's helped many others break through this kind of paralysis: Start incredibly small. Don't think about the whole semester or your full set of goals. Just focus on one tiny action you can take in the next 5 minutes. For your immediate situation, that might be simply opening the course catalog website. Not registering yet - just opening the page. \n\nOnce you do that first micro-step, the next small action becomes easier. Maybe spend 10 minutes browsing available classes. Then maybe write down 2-3 that interest you. Breaking it down into these tiny steps makes it far less overwhelming than trying to figure out your entire academic future at once.\n\nRemember that \"failing\" at something is actually valuable data - it teaches you what doesn't work so you can adjust your approach. Every person you see confidently moving forward has their own collection of failures behind them. They just learned to see those setbacks as feedback rather than final verdicts.\n\nThe key is to get into motion, even if it's imperfect. Action creates clarity. Start with that one small step today - literally just opening the course website. You've got this, and taking action will help quiet those anxious thoughts better than any amount of planning ever could.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling to break free from the cycle of anxiety and overthinking that's holding you back from taking that first step towards self-improvement. One thing that might help is to focus on making tiny, almost ridiculously small, commitments to yourself. For example, instead of worrying about signing up for classes, tell yourself you'll just spend 10 minutes looking at the course catalog today. Or, commit to sending one email or making one phone call related to your goals. By starting with these tiny steps, you can build momentum and gradually become more comfortable with taking action. It's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have everything figured out, and that uncertainty is a natural part of the process. Rather than trying to predict every possible outcome, try to focus on what you can control in the present moment. Remember, it's not about being fearless, but about being brave enough to take that first step despite your fears. As for your spring semester classes, why not set a specific goal to sign up by the end of the week, and break down the tasks you need to complete to make that happen? Having a clear plan can help alleviate some of that anxiety and make it feel more manageable. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of being stuck in a rut and overthinking everything is super common. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get things \"right\" the first time, and that's paralyzing.\n\nInstead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, maybe try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of signing up for all your classes, just spend 15 minutes browsing the course catalog. Or, if you're anxious about a specific goal, identify the absolute smallest action you can take towards it – even if it seems insignificant. The point is to build momentum and prove to yourself that you *can* take action without everything falling apart.\n\nAlso, try to reframe \"failure\" as learning. Everyone messes up, and it's how we learn and grow. Maybe keep a journal and write down what you learned from each \"failure\" – you might be surprised at how much you actually gain.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You've been feeling this way for a while, so it's going to take time to change. Celebrate the small wins and don't beat yourself up for the setbacks. You got this!\n"

You could start by taking an online course or joining a local science club to see if it still sparks your interest. Also, your skills in problem-solving and creating could be a great fit for fields like data analysis or product development, where you can see the impact of your work. As for your idea about self-help videos or daily routines on YouTube, it sounds promising! It could be a way to connect with people and share your journey, which aligns with your values. Just start small, maybe with a few videos, and see how it feels. Remember, finding your passion is often about trying new things and being open to where they might lead. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "It seems like you've already explored quite a few different paths, which is actually really valuable - you now know what doesn't fully click for you. Looking at your pattern, you seem drawn to analytical and creative pursuits that have broader impact. The physical sciences standing out as your last true interest is particularly noteworthy.\n\nHave you considered combining multiple elements you've enjoyed? For example, your interest in physical sciences could merge with your content creation ideas - there's a huge demand for engaging science communication. Your background in psychology and economics adds valuable perspective for breaking down complex topics for others.\n\nInstead of trying to find one perfect passion, try running small experiments. Pick something that interests you (like those science topics) and commit to a 30-day project. Could be writing daily posts, making short videos, or diving into research. The key is to set concrete goals and actually complete the experiment before judging if it's right for you.\n\nYour values around honesty and desire for broader impact are great anchors. Rather than waiting to feel completely ready for something like YouTube content, start with a minimal viable version. Post once a week about a topic you're genuinely curious about, see how it feels, adjust based on feedback.\n\nRemember that passion often follows competence - the more you develop skills in an area, the more engaging it becomes. Focus first on consistent action in a direction that aligns with your values, even if you're not 100% certain it's \"the one.\"",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and are trying to find something that truly resonates with you. First, kudos to you for exploring so many different areas - that takes a lot of courage and curiosity. One thing that stands out to me is your interest in physical sciences, which you mentioned was the last time you felt truly interested in something. Have you considered revisiting that or exploring related fields like environmental science, biotech, or even science communication? These areas could potentially align with your values of honesty and scope of influencing many people.\n\nAlso, it's great that you've been watching videos on history, self-help, and other topics - sometimes our hobbies can give us clues about what we're passionate about. You might want to try experimenting with creating content around these topics, like writing blog posts or even just discussing them with friends, to see if that sparks any excitement.\n\nRegarding your idea of creating self-help videos or daily routine content on YouTube, that's definitely a viable option. However, instead of waiting until you're \"ready,\" why not start small and just begin creating? You could start by recording yourself talking about topics that interest you, or even just sharing your thoughts on social media. This can help you build momentum and see if it's something you enjoy.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to reflect on what specifically is driving your desire for a sense of purpose. Is it the need to make a positive impact, to be creative, or to feel fulfilled? Once you have a clearer understanding of what's driving you, you can start exploring options that align with those values and goals.

Write down a few topics you're passionate about and outline a potential video. Even just the act of planning might give you more clarity.\n\nThe key is to experiment and not put too much pressure on yourself to find the \"perfect\" thing right away.

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.\n\n3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\n\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to make changes and improve your life.

It's good that you already have fitness as a cornerstone habit and some savings to work with. Let's build on that foundation.\n\nStart by creating a simple daily routine. Since you're already into fitness, use that as your anchor. Add one small habit at a time - maybe reading for 15 minutes after your workout, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill online. The key is consistency over intensity.\n\nFor the career front, consider what interests naturally align with your fitness background. Personal training, health coaching, or even fitness-related content creation could be worth exploring. Or you might want to go in a completely different direction - that's fine too. Pick one direction and take small steps: update your resume, apply to one job daily, or take an online course in your chosen field.\n\nFor building relationships, look for local fitness groups or sports leagues. These give you a natural way to meet people while doing something you're already comfortable with. Meetup.com can be good for finding groups aligned with whatever interests you develop as you explore new activities.\n\nRemember that everyone you meet who seems to \"have it together\" went through their own period of feeling lost. The difference is they kept moving forward, even if they weren't sure of the destination.

This could be something as simple as reading for 30 minutes each day, learning a new skill or hobby, or volunteering in your community. Sometimes, having a sense of purpose or feeling like we're making progress in one area can help spill over into other areas of our lives.\n\nIt's also worth considering seeking out some professional help, whether that's a therapist or counselor, to work through some of the underlying issues that might be contributing to your feelings of depression and isolation. They can help you develop strategies for managing your emotions and improving your relationships with others.\n\nAs for feeling like you're making a difference in people's lives, that's a really admirable goal. You might consider looking into local volunteer opportunities or joining a community group that aligns with your interests.

Lots of people are still finding their way at this age, and it's never too late to make positive changes in your life.

But this is the reason I wake up in the morning feeling as though someone is stabbing me in the heart and feel pukish whenever I think about it.\n\nIt's 4 papers which must be written together (granted it's very very difficult papers, but I've not even got to the difficult part because I haven't even finished the video lectures), and I've been unable to watch it completely for 3 years now despite allocating so much time and energy of my life to it.\n\nCycle: I do not consistently stick to the plan, I get severe anxiety when the exams get close by cause I'm nowhere close, that turns into full blown paranoia and panic attacks, I skip the exam, drown myself in guilt, tears and regret, then decide to get my shit together and make a plan and then it goes back to the start of the cycle. I've done this for 7 exam cycles now and I cannot take it anymore, but I will not quit this. I will not take a break either, so please don't suggest it to me. \n\nI need a solution that will help me stick to the plan of watching video lectures and then studying it after, because despite these terrible consequences to my actions, I am still not able to stick to my plan and I want to change that. I have to be consistently disciplined for me to pull through this and I cannot rely on myself or self discipline, as I've tried and failed at it too many times. I would appreciate any input you might have. Cheers :)",

That could be why you keep lapsing over the years. What needs of yours are not being met? Do you have any mental illnesses, depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc.? If so are you getting trearment for them?\n\nIt's awesome that you're trying hard to get things done!! But the goal of productivity is not for productivity's sake, it's for YOUR sake. You undoubtedly want this, but something is getting in the way, and we gotta know what. I hope it's just how you wrote the post and you're not actually neglecting yourself of care and attention!!",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really determined to tackle this, which is a great start. One approach you might try is breaking down your tasks into even smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of focusing on completing an entire lecture, aim to watch just 5-10 minutes at a time. Set a timer and commit to just that small segment. Once you finish, take a short break and then decide if you can do another 5-10 minutes. This can help reduce the overwhelming feeling and make it easier to get started.\n\nAlso, consider pairing this with a reward system. After completing a small chunk, give yourself a little treat or do something you enjoy for a few minutes. This can help create a positive association with the task. \n\nLastly, accountability can be a game-changer. Since you have a great support system, maybe ask someone to check in with you regularly about your progress. Sometimes knowing that someone else is aware of your goals can help keep you on track. Keep pushing forward, and remember that progress, no matter how small, is still progress. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for sharing your situation - it takes courage to be this honest about what you're going through. The cycle you described is brutal, but we can work on breaking it.\n\nFirst, let's shrink this mountain into manageable hills. Instead of thinking about all 4 papers or even completing full lectures, start with just 10 minutes of one lecture. That's it. Set a timer, watch 10 minutes, then stop. Do this once per day for a week. Don't worry about taking notes or understanding everything - just watch. The goal is to build consistency with zero pressure.\n\nOnce you can do 10 minutes consistently, bump it to 15 minutes. Then 20. Small increases. The key is that you're allowed to stop when the timer ends, even mid-sentence. This removes the pressure of completion and lets you build momentum.\n\nFor accountability, try the \"seinfeld strategy\" - get a physical calendar and put an X through each day you complete your minutes. Your only job is to not break the chain of X's. This works because it shifts focus from the overwhelming end goal to just showing up each day.\n\nWhen anxiety hits, remember: you're not sitting down to write 4 papers or master the material. You're just showing up for today's minutes. That's all you have to do.\n\nYou mentioned you can't rely on self-discipline, so don't. Rely on systems instead. Timer + Calendar + Small chunks = A system that works even when motivation doesn't. \n\nStart with 10 minutes tomorrow. Just 10 minutes. Post back here in a week and let us know how it's going.",
        "llama_comment": "I can sense the desperation and frustration in your post, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. It's clear that you've tried a wide range of strategies to overcome your procrastination, but nothing seems to be sticking. One thing that stands out to me is the sheer amount of pressure you're putting on yourself to complete these 4 papers, and the devastating consequences you experience when you don't meet your own expectations. \n\nRather than trying to tackle the entire problem at once, I'd suggest breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of focusing on watching all the video lectures, try committing to just 10-15 minutes of lecture watching per day. That's it. Don't worry about studying or taking notes, just show up and watch the lectures for that short amount of time. \n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider implementing a \"pre-game\" routine to help signal to your brain that it's time to focus. This could be something as simple as making a cup of coffee, doing a quick 5-minute meditation, or going for a short walk. The goal is to create a consistent trigger that tells your brain it's time to get to work.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle, and that it's okay to ask for help. Since you have a great support system at home, consider sharing your daily goals with them and asking them to hold you accountable. This could be as simple as sending a text message each day saying \"I watched my 10 minutes of lectures\" or \"I didn't watch my lectures today, I'll try again tomorrow\".\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that it's not about being consistently disciplined, but rather about being consistently gentle with yourself. You've been through a lot, and it's time to start treating yourself with kindness and compassion. Remember that it's okay to have off days, and that one missed day doesn't mean you've failed entirely. You've got this, and you can take it one small step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, and it's admirable that you're determined to keep fighting. It's clear you've tried a lot, so let's think outside the box a bit.\n\nSince relying on yourself hasn't worked, let's focus on external accountability and breaking things down *smaller*. You mentioned study rooms, but maybe you need something even more structured. Could you find a virtual study group that meets daily, even if just for an hour, specifically to watch lectures? The key is that you're not alone, and there's a set time you *have* to show up.\n\nAlso, those papers sound daunting. Instead of focusing on \"watching all the lectures,\" can you break it down into *tiny* chunks? Like, \"watch 10 minutes of lecture and then summarize it in one sentence.\" Seriously, that small. The goal isn't to learn everything at once, it's to break the paralysis. Celebrate those tiny wins.\n\nFinally, since anxiety is a major factor, have you explored mindfulness or meditation techniques specifically for managing panic attacks *during* study sessions? There are apps and guided meditations that can help you ground yourself in the moment when you feel that anxiety rising. It's about interrupting the cycle *as it's happening*, not just dealing with the aftermath. Good luck, you've got this.\n"

        "claude_comment": "Overthinking often comes from wanting to make the \"perfect\" decision, but perfect decisions don't exist - only decisions we can learn and grow from. The key is to start taking small actions instead of getting stuck in analysis paralysis.\n\nFor your major decision, try this approach: Set a firm deadline (say, 2 weeks) to make your choice. During this time, talk to people in both fields, shadow them if possible, or take an intro class. But when the deadline hits, make your choice with the information you have. Remember you can always adjust course later - your major doesn't permanently lock you into a career path.\n\nFor the broader overthinking issue, start practicing \"time-boxing\" your decisions. Give yourself a strict time limit to think about choices, then commit to action. Start with tiny decisions - \"I'll spend 2 minutes deciding what to eat, then just pick something.\" As you build confidence with small choices, apply it to bigger ones.\n\nAlso, try this mental shift: Instead of viewing decisions as permanent and scary, see them as experiments. Each choice is a chance to learn something new about yourself and what works for you. The only true failure is staying stuck in analysis mode and not taking action at all.\n\nYour awareness of these thought patterns is actually a strength - now you can start catching yourself when you spiral into overthinking and redirect that energy into small, concrete steps forward.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling with analysis paralysis and self-doubt, which can be totally debilitating. One thing that might help is to set a timer for, say, 10-15 minutes and just write down all your thoughts and concerns without stopping or editing yourself. This can help get everything out of your head and onto paper, where you can start to see patterns and prioritize what's really important. From there, try to break down big decisions (like switching majors) into smaller, more manageable tasks - like researching different programs, talking to advisors, or shadowing someone in a field you're interested in. This can make the decision feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of momentum. Additionally, consider setting aside specific times of the day for \"thinking\" and \"worrying\", so you can try to contain those thoughts and not let them bleed into the rest of your day. As for taking things personally, it might be helpful to remind yourself that other people's opinions often say more about themselves than they do about you - and that it's okay to acknowledge their words without internalizing them. Lastly, don't underestimate the power of taking small actions towards your goals, even if it feels like you're not making progress - sometimes just showing up and doing something, anything, can help build confidence and get you out of that feeling of being stuck.",

You're essentially running mental simulations all day, and that takes a toll.\n\nAbout the major switch: the pros and cons list is a good start, but maybe try a different approach. Instead of just listing, try *experiencing*. Can you shadow someone in the field you're considering? Take an introductory class? Even just watching relevant documentaries or reading articles can give you a better feel than endless lists.\n\nAs for the overthinking in general, a couple of things have helped me:\n\n*   **Mindfulness:** Even a few minutes of daily meditation (there are tons of free apps) can help you become more aware of your thoughts *without* getting swept away by them.\n*   **Small Actions:** Break down tasks into ridiculously small steps. Instead of \"write a paper,\" it's \"open the document.\" The momentum can help you overcome the initial inertia.\n*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you catch yourself spiraling, ask yourself: \"Is this thought actually helpful? Is it based on facts, or just assumptions?\"\n\nFinally, remember that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with overthinking and self-doubt.

If social media is your weakness, delete the apps and only access them through browser. If you procrastinate in bed, put your phone across the room. Create friction for the habits you want to break and remove friction for the ones you want to build.\n\nRemember that change isn't linear.

Once you have a better understanding of what's holding you back, you can start to break down the change you want to make into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, instead of saying \"I'm going to completely overhaul my habits,\" try saying \"today, I'm going to take one small step towards my goal, like doing 10 minutes of exercise or reading for 15 minutes.\" By focusing on tiny, achievable wins, you can start to build momentum and develop the discipline to make larger changes over time.

In the evening, do a 10-minute pickup of any items out of place, load/run the dishwasher, and wipe kitchen counters.\n\nFor deeper cleaning, assign different tasks to specific days. Maybe bathrooms on Monday, vacuuming on Wednesday, dusting on Friday, etc. This way, you're never facing an overwhelming amount of cleaning at once. Set a timer for 20 minutes - you'd be amazed how much you can get done in focused bursts.\n\nThe real game-changer is building these small habits until they become automatic.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It’s awesome that you’re looking to make the most of your summer. Since you’re already working out and doing chores, you’ve got a good start. Here are a few ideas to fill your day with more activities:\n\n1. **Learn Something New**: Pick up a new skill or hobby. You could try learning a musical instrument, coding, drawing, or even cooking. There are tons of free resources online to get you started.\n\n2. **Set Small Goals**: Try setting daily or weekly goals for yourself. It could be reading a book, writing a short story, or completing a puzzle. Having something to work towards can give your day more structure.\n\n3. **Volunteer**: Look for local volunteer opportunities. It’s a great way to meet new people, gain experience, and make a positive impact in your community.\n\n4. **Explore Nature**: If you can, spend some time outdoors. Go for a walk, hike, or bike ride. It’s a great way to clear your mind and get some fresh air.\n\n5. **Create a Routine**: Even if you don’t have a lot of responsibilities, having a routine can help you feel more productive. Try waking up at the same time each day and planning out your activities.\n\nRemember, it’s all about experimenting and finding what you enjoy. Good luck, and have fun exploring new things!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there! Summer vacation at 15 is actually a perfect time to explore new interests and build some structure into your days. Since you already work out and handle chores, you've got a good foundation - let's build on that.\n\nFirst, try setting a consistent wake-up time even during vacation. It helps create momentum for the day. Then, consider picking up some skills that'll be useful long-term. Learning to code is completely free online through sites like Codecademy. Since you're into music, maybe try learning an instrument or music production - there are tons of free resources for both.\n\nReading is another solid hobby that can fill time productively. Your local library probably has free ebooks and audiobooks you can access from home. You could also start a creative project - writing, digital art, or even starting a YouTube channel about music reviews.\n\nWant something more active? Look into bodyweight fitness routines to complement your workouts, learn to cook (super useful life skill), or pick up running/cycling. These are all basically free and can give your days more structure.\n\nThe key is to experiment. Try different things for a week each. Some won't stick, and that's fine - but you might find something you really love. Start small with 30-60 minutes a day on a new activity, and build from there.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling a bit aimless without a structured schedule. First, kudos to you for recognizing that you want more out of your days and being open to exploring new hobbies. Since you enjoy music, you might consider learning an instrument or producing music - there are plenty of online resources to get you started. As for other hobbies, you could try drawing, writing, or even coding. The key is to experiment and find what truly interests you. \n\nIn the meantime, why not set a few small goals for yourself each day? This could be as simple as reading a chapter in a book, taking a walk outside, or trying a new recipe. Having something to look forward to can make getting out of bed more exciting. You might also consider setting a consistent wake-up time and creating a morning routine that works for you - this can help give your days some structure even without a traditional schedule. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about scrolling through YouTube; it's okay to have some downtime, just try to balance it with more engaging activities. What do you think might be a good starting point for you?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that's a pretty common feeling when you've got a lot of free time. It sounds like you've already got a good base with working out and chores, so that's awesome! Since you're into music, maybe try learning an instrument or diving deeper into music production if you're not already. Summer's a great time to experiment.\n\nTo give your days more structure, try setting a simple daily goal, like \"learn 3 new guitar chords\" or \"read one chapter of a book.\" It doesn't have to be huge, just something to give you a little direction. Also, think about what you're *curious* about. Is there anything you've always wanted to try but haven't? Could be anything from coding to drawing to learning a new language. Use YouTube to learn new skills.\n\nFinally, maybe try setting a consistent wake-up time, even on vacation. It can make it easier to get motivated and feel like you're actually accomplishing something during the day. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "Hi there, I’m looking for advice on how to move forward in my 30s - been speaking to friends and counsellors regarding my lack of action, self-loathing, difficulty in applying myself and the skills gained or developed, and the difficulty of following through. I’m creative (design, arts, music, digital), athletic, enjoy being around people, enjoy leading or teaching skills to others, and desiring a much needed change. Really needing independence, and not sure how to apply myself in regards to finding new jobs that might be out of reach, or I may find interest in but don’t have all the necessary knowledge, education, software knowledge, etc. I’m not sure how long this process would take but let’s say if finding a new job could happen within a few weeks to a month, that would be great. I am faced with a lot of defeat and inaction due to failures and doubts in my past, and require the necessary know-how to overcome such obstacles. I’ve never met people in my shoes within my social circles, it seems like everyone has their head on their shoulders, have a lot of energy, and are readily taking on life’s challenges each day (such as work, school, managing finances, managing time better, having two jobs, working 12 hour shifts, balancing a social life, dating, etc). I just feel like this ongoing weirdo with a lack of direction and drive, and much of this is hidden while I just play the role of a “happy clown” (can confirm this, friends said I seemed really happy today, but this is without knowing what’s going on inside/in my life), meanwhile I really know my life needs to be in order.",

It sounds like you have a lot of creative and athletic talents, which is a fantastic foundation to build on. Starting over in your 30s can feel daunting, but it's definitely doable. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Identify Your Strengths and Interests**: You mentioned enjoying design, arts, music, and teaching. Consider roles that might combine these interests, like teaching art or music, or working in a creative team. \n\n2. **Skill Up**: If you're worried about lacking certain skills or software knowledge, there are tons of online resources and courses that can help you upskill quickly. Websites like Coursera, Udemy, or even YouTube can be great for this.\n\n3. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, set small, manageable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning a new skill or applying to a certain number of jobs each week.\n\n4. **Network**: Reach out to people in fields you're interested in. LinkedIn can be a great tool for this. Sometimes, just having a conversation with someone in the industry can provide insights and opportunities you hadn't considered.\n\n5. **Mindset Shift**: It's easy to compare yourself to others, but remember that everyone has their own struggles. Focus on your journey and progress. Celebrate small wins and be kind to yourself.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Keep talking to your friends and counselors. They can provide support and accountability as you work towards your goals.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel like you're starting over. Many people reinvent themselves multiple times throughout their lives. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - first off, know that feeling directionless in your 30s is way more common than you might think, even if your social circle seems to have it all figured out. The \"happy clown\" facade is something many people maintain while working through similar challenges.\n\nStarting over career-wise is totally doable, especially with your creative background. Instead of trying to transform everything at once, pick one specific direction that interests you most right now - maybe UI design, digital art, or creative direction. Then break down the exact skills gap between where you are and where you need to be for entry-level roles in that field.\n\nFor the next month, create a simple daily routine: Spend 2-3 hours each morning working on those specific skills before anything else. Use free resources like YouTube tutorials, Coursera, or industry-specific training sites. The key is consistency over intensity - even an hour a day of focused learning adds up quickly.\n\nWhile building skills, start putting together a portfolio of practice work. This gives you something concrete to show potential employers, even without formal experience. Network on LinkedIn and reach out to people in roles you're interested in - many are happy to share advice or even mentorship.\n\nThe self-doubt and past failures feel heavy, but they don't define your future capabilities. Focus on taking small, consistent actions each day rather than getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Success builds on itself - each small win will help rebuild your confidence and momentum.\n\nRemember that everyone you see \"crushing it\" started somewhere and likely faced similar doubts. Your creative and interpersonal skills are valuable assets - now it's just about channeling them in a specific direction with consistent daily effort.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure about how to move forward with your life, especially when it seems like those around you have their lives together. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the need for change and are seeking help - that's a huge step. It might be helpful to start by breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of finding a new job or gaining new skills, try focusing on one thing at a time. For example, you could start by updating your resume, or taking an online course to learn a new software or skill. This can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment. \n\nIt's also important to remember that everyone faces challenges and setbacks, even if it doesn't seem like it from the outside. Those friends who seem to have their lives together might be struggling with their own issues, and it's unlikely that anyone has everything figured out all the time. Rather than comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own strengths and interests. You mentioned being creative, athletic, and enjoying teaching and leading - these are all great skills that could be applied to a variety of careers or pursuits.\n\nIn terms of finding a new job, it might be helpful to start by exploring different fields or industries that align with your interests and skills. You could also try reaching out to people in your network who work in areas that interest you, and ask if they'd be willing to chat about their experiences. This can be a great way to get a sense of what different careers are like, and might help you find something that's a good fit.\n\nLastly, be patient with yourself and try not to put too much pressure on finding a new job or getting your life together in a short amount of time. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's unlikely that everything will fall into place overnight. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's normal for it to take some time to figure things out. You got this, and taking small steps towards your goals can add up over time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're feeling stuck, but also like you have a lot of potential and self-awareness, which is a great starting point. It's totally normal to feel lost in your 30s, so don't beat yourself up too much.\n\nFirst, about the job search: a month might be tight for a complete career change, but it's doable to get the ball rolling. Instead of aiming for the \"perfect\" job right away, think about smaller steps. Could you freelance in one of your creative areas to build a portfolio and gain confidence? Even a few small projects can make a difference. Also, look into online courses or tutorials for software you need to learn. Many are free or low-cost, and even a basic understanding can open doors.\n\nRegarding the \"happy clown\" thing, it's good you're aware of it. It's exhausting to keep up a facade. Maybe try being a little more vulnerable with a *trusted* friend or family member. Just sharing what you're going through can lighten the load.\n\nAs for overcoming past failures, try reframing them. Instead of seeing them as proof of inadequacy, view them as learning experiences. What did you learn from each one? How can you apply that knowledge moving forward?\n\nFinally, don't compare yourself to others. Everyone's journey is different, and social media often shows a highlight reel, not the full picture. Focus on your own progress, no matter how small. Start with one tiny, achievable goal each day – maybe it's spending 30 minutes on a job application, learning a new software skill, or going for a walk. Celebrate those small wins. You got this!\n"

Listen to your body to try not to get too discouraged.\n\nSome less-vague ideas:\nSometimes I get up and do something else for a bit, then lay back down, and sleep comes easier. (Usually just something relaxing, like reading.) Other times I'll stay in bed, but try to occupy myself with something else. I'll try to say the alphabet backwards, or just tell myself I'm only going to relax tonight and not sleep.

Here are a few things you might try to get back on track:\n\n1. **Gradual Shift**: Instead of trying to make a drastic change, gradually adjust your sleep schedule. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can help your body adjust more naturally.\n\n2. **Consistent Routine**: Establish a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.\n\n3. **Morning Light**: Get some sunlight in the morning. Natural light can help reset your circadian rhythm and make you feel more awake.\n\n4. **Wind Down**: Create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could be reading, taking a warm shower, or doing some light stretching.\n\n5. **Limit Naps**: If you need to nap, try to keep it short (20-30 minutes) and avoid napping late in the day.\n\n6. **Caffeine and Screens**: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and limit screen time an hour before bed. The blue light from screens can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.\n\n7. **Accountability Partner**: Since running with a friend helped, maybe find another buddy or join a group that meets in the morning. Having someone else involved can be a great motivator.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and keep experimenting to find what works best for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Getting your sleep schedule back on track is totally doable, but you'll need to tackle this systematically rather than trying to force dramatic changes overnight. Here's what works:\n\nFirst, start by shifting your schedule gradually. Instead of jumping straight to 6am, move your wake time 30 minutes earlier every few days. If you're currently waking at 4pm, aim for 3:30pm for 2-3 days, then 3pm, and so on. This gives your body clock time to adjust.\n\nFor the actual wake-up part: As soon as your alarm goes off, immediately get up and go outside for 5-10 minutes. Natural sunlight is crucial for resetting your circadian rhythm. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is way more effective than indoor lighting.\n\nTo avoid those multi-hour naps (which are definitely sabotaging your sleep schedule), set a strict rule: no naps after 4pm, and keep them to 20 minutes max. Use an actual timer. When you feel sleepy during the day, try some light exercise, a cold shower, or stepping outside instead.\n\nThe key to making this stick is what you do before bed. Create a wind-down routine starting 1-2 hours before sleep: dim the lights, avoid screens (or use blue light filters), and do calm activities like reading or stretching. Your body needs these consistent signals that it's time to sleep.\n\nMost importantly: be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. A regular wake time is more important than a regular bedtime when you're trying to fix your schedule. Your body will eventually start getting naturally tired at the right time.\n\nRemember that this process takes time - expect 2-3 weeks before it feels natural. The first week especially will be tough, but pushing through that initial discomfort is worth it for the long-term benefits you've already experienced when you managed to wake up early before.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're really struggling to find a rhythm that works for you, and it's great that you're acknowledging the importance of establishing a healthy sleep pattern. One thing that might be worth trying is setting a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, to help regulate your body's internal clock. It's also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches.\n\nGiven that you've tried a lot of different alarm strategies without success, it might be helpful to focus on creating an environment that supports wakefulness, rather than relying solely on alarms. This could mean opening your curtains to let natural light in, or using a wake-up light, which simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light in your room over a set period of time.\n\nIt's also worth considering the fact that you're feeling demotivated and overwhelmed - it's possible that addressing the underlying stress and anxiety could help you feel more energized and focused. Have you thought about breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, or setting specific goals for what you want to achieve each day? Sometimes, having a clear sense of purpose and direction can make it easier to get moving in the morning.\n\nFinally, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - developing new habits takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. It might be helpful to track your progress, not just in terms of your sleep schedule, but also in terms of how you're feeling and what you're accomplishing each day. This can help you identify patterns and make adjustments as needed. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's great that you're taking steps towards creating positive change in your life.",

It's a cycle, and recognizing it is the first step to breaking it. Since you know waking up early makes you more productive, let's focus on making that sustainable.\n\nIt sounds like you've tried some extreme methods. Maybe try something more gradual? Instead of aiming for 6 AM right away, try waking up 30 minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal. This can help your body adjust more smoothly.\n\nAlso, think about your \"sleep hygiene.\" Is your room dark, quiet, and cool? Are you avoiding screens for an hour or two before bed? A consistent bedtime routine can signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Even something simple like reading a book or taking a warm bath can help.\n\nSince coffee doesn't work, maybe try some sunlight exposure first thing in the morning. It can help regulate your circadian rhythm. Even just sitting by a window for a bit can make a difference.\n\nFinally, about the demotivation: break down that overwhelming workload into smaller, manageable tasks. Even completing one small thing can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum. Maybe try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break).\n\nGood luck!

      "body": "Hey all,\n\nI turned 30 years old this year and ended up back living with my parents after going through a pit of depression about 6 years ago. In that time, I've graduated from a school in music production and am one course away from a diploma in HR which i'm still somewhat not convinced is entirely a real job lol... How do I somehow get my life together? I've been out of work for 6 months since finishing my last year of school and am super confused. I've worked a lot of entry level positions since I was 16 in retail, sales, customer service, warehouse as well as a bit of labour but never really stuck with anything for longer than 3 months to a year. I feel like I'm super arrogant as well for no reason and I just don't know how to move forward. I spent a substantial amount of time drinking and partying in university with little to no effort on school and ended up flunking out 10 years ago which was a  definitely a bit of a blow to my confidence as well as my drive/ambitions. I spent alot of my early 20's trying to pursue music and at some point that just seemed like a super unrealistic goal so I said \"screw it\" and gave it up... That's about the same time I started to get somewhat depressed. I like to think I'm not an unintelligent person and can sometimes be very resourceful but the second half of my twenties was just a big shit show and I feel like I'm trying to pick up the pieces.\n\nTo add to all that I have zero close relationships other than my parents (who are a bit fed up at this point) and zero friends at the moment after being one of the more sociable guys growing up (Maybe a bit narcissistic in hindsight) . I've let a lot of things die out in my life because I've struggled with hard work, dedication as well as forming deep relationships/moving forward. At this point, I'm thinking of going back to school for health sciences because it's really the only thing that I've been interested in the past 5 years and I've been active/lifted weights since I was about 13 years old. On the other hand I thought about going for computer science/programming because I've also played games for most of my life. Figured I could maybe make a career out of it one of those. I've also thought about going a more local community college which is in my hometown and working towards a trade certificate which would be a bit more stable even though I've never really been or worked in any trades environments. I dunno. At this point the only two people around me are my parents who give me feedback but their bottom line is to just get me out of the house asap. If you made it to the end of this you're the real MVP :). Any help would be appreciated.\n\nTLDR: Turned 30 recently- diplomas in useless program thinking about going back to school or not really too sure how to fix my life, job and relationships.",

Don't give up on that. Get a job in HR for a little while and build some funds  \n\n\n\\#3 - During that time, work on yourself. Grace, etiquette, humility. If you have a day job, you can practice music at night or other hobbies.   \n\n\n\\#4 - volunteer. This one is always overlooked imho.

Same with budgeting, deeper relationships, etc. Learn about them first, then put them to practice.

The good news is you've already taken some positive steps by completing education and staying physically active.\n\nRather than jumping straight into another degree, I'd suggest taking a more structured approach to finding your direction. Start with a 3-month plan:\n\nMonth 1: While living with your parents, commit to applying for HR positions since you're one course away from that diploma. Even if you're skeptical about the field, getting some professional experience will help you make better decisions about your next move. Apply to at least 3 jobs every weekday, and use LinkedIn to connect with HR professionals.\n\nMonth 2: While job hunting, pick ONE potential career path (health sciences, programming, or trades) and spend 2 hours each day exploring it properly. Take free online courses, talk to people in the field, and try actual work in that area. For programming, start with free resources like freeCodeCamp. For health sciences, volunteer at a local clinic or facility.\n\nMonth 3: By now, you should either have some job prospects in HR or a clearer picture of which new direction feels right. Make your decision based on this real-world experience rather than theoretical ideas.\n\nThroughout this time, rebuild your social connections gradually. Join a gym class or local sports league - since you're already into fitness, this is a natural way to meet people while doing something you enjoy.\n\nRemember, you don't need to have it all figured out right now. Focus on taking consistent small steps forward rather than trying to solve everything at once. The structure and stability will help lift the depression, and you'll start building momentum.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed with the direction of your life right now, which is completely understandable given the challenges you've faced. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to recognize the need for change and to be willing to make adjustments, so kudos to you for taking this first step. \n\nOne thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to have your entire life figured out right now, try focusing on what you can accomplish in the next week or month. This could be as simple as updating your resume, applying to a few jobs, or reaching out to someone in your desired field for advice. \n\nIt's also great that you're considering different educational paths, such as health sciences, computer science, or a trade certificate. You might find it helpful to research each of these options more thoroughly and make a list of pros and cons for each. This can help you get a clearer sense of which direction aligns best with your interests and strengths. \n\nIn terms of building relationships, it might be worth looking into local groups or clubs that align with your interests. This could be a great way to meet new people who share similar passions, and it might help you build some connections outside of your family. \n\nLastly, try not to be too hard on yourself, okay? It's okay to not have everything figured out at 30, and it sounds like you've been through a lot in the past few years. Be patient with yourself, and remember that it's never too late to make positive changes in your life. You got this.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, turning 30 can feel like a reset button, so don't beat yourself up too much about the past. It sounds like you're at a crossroads, which is totally normal.\n\nFirst, about getting out of your parents' house: that's a valid goal, but don't let it pressure you into a bad decision. A stable job is key. Since you're unsure about HR, maybe put that diploma on hold.\n\nRegarding your career options, instead of jumping straight into another degree, try some low-stakes exploration. You mentioned health sciences, programming, and trades. Could you volunteer at a clinic, take a free online coding course (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp), or shadow someone in a trade for a day? This will give you a taste without a huge commitment.\n\nFor the job search, focus on your transferable skills from those entry-level jobs. Customer service, sales, even warehouse work – they all teach valuable skills. Tailor your resume to highlight those skills for the jobs you're applying for.\n\nAs for relationships, start small. Join a local sports team, a hiking group, or a book club related to your interests. Consistent, low-pressure interaction is key to building connections.\n\nFinally, about feeling arrogant: sometimes that's just insecurity in disguise. Focus on being genuinely curious about others and actively listening. It's a great way to build rapport and shift your perspective.\n\nTake it one step at a time. Small, consistent actions will get you moving in the right direction. Good luck!\n"

I was still in school but the pandemic made me realize that I was not happy with the degree I was pursing. So I left the program and just stopped. I worked the entire time and was figuring myself out. I ended up transferring to a university that I decided about a year later.\nHaving some sort of plan is the key though so you don’t get too distracted. And give urself a timeline of how long you may need the rest. And there is not wrong with extending that timeline too. A year or even 2, your body and mind are the most important things.\nAlso remember, THERE IS NO RUSH!! You cannot compare yourself to others because you are on a different path that they are. And there is nothing wrong with that. Your journey is gonna look different from everyone else. I also recommend TheBlissBean, Lavendaire, MucheleB, and RowenaTsai. They are all on YouTube and they make content regarding to school, lifestyle, finding yourself and being more mindful in general. There is also Matt D’Avella, Ali Abdaal, Nathaniel drew, Captain Sinbad, and Thomas Frank.

I'm 31 and working on my fourth degree, which is like my 7th serious career change. \n\nI've also gotten depression lately and I can tell you trying to do coursework at the same time is HARD. I have been doing minimal semesters and barely passing. \n\nI do suggest you get a license and a working phone sooner than later though. Those are hugely helpful when you're on your own. \n\nSet a hard deadline for the end of the year and be sure to mark when college applications and FAFSA submissions are due and when the semester officially starts. Oh, and some colleges DO allow you to apply a full year ahead. You can always choose not to go. And you don't have to pay tuition until the drop date (when the school automatically drops people from the classes for non payment)",

It sounds like you're aware of the challenges you might face, which is a good start. If you decide to take a gap year, try setting some specific goals for yourself. Maybe aim to achieve one or two key things each month, whether it's related to your mental health, personal development, or practical skills. This way, you can build a sense of accomplishment and keep yourself from feeling stuck. Remember, college isn't going anywhere, and taking time to prepare yourself can actually make your college experience more rewarding. Just make sure to have a plan and some structure to your time off so you can make the most of it. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Taking a gap year can be a really smart move when you need time to build a stronger foundation. The key is having a concrete plan for that time - otherwise it's easy to stay stuck.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: Make a 12-month roadmap with specific goals. Start with the basics like getting your license and phone sorted in the first few months. Then add some part-time work to build financial skills and responsibility. Use the structure of a job to create daily routines and accountability.\n\nFor the depression piece, use this time to establish good habits around sleep, exercise, and getting professional help if needed. These fundamentals will serve you well whether you're in college or not.\n\nThe fear of \"putting it off forever\" is valid, but remember - a strategic pause to get yourself ready isn't the same as giving up. Set a firm timeline (like \"I'm starting fall 2024 no matter what\") and work backwards from there with monthly milestones.\n\nCollege will still be there, and you'll likely get way more out of it if you're starting from a place of strength rather than struggling to keep your head above water. Just make sure you're using this time intentionally to grow and prepare, not just to avoid the challenge.",

Having a clear plan can help you stay focused and motivated, and ensure that you're using this time to develop the skills and confidence you need to succeed in college. It's also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor about your depression, as they can provide you with additional support and guidance during this time.

        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's good you're thinking proactively about this. A gap year *could* be really beneficial, but your concerns about it turning into just more procrastination are valid.\n\nHere's my take: a gap year isn't a magic fix. It's a *tool*. To use it effectively, you need a plan. Don't just drift. If you decide to take the gap year, break down what you want to achieve. You mentioned getting your license and a phone – those are concrete goals. Make a timeline for them. Maybe license by [Date], phone by [Date].\n\nMore importantly, address the depression. Can you find a therapist or counselor to work with during this gap year? That should be priority number one. Think of it as building a foundation *before* you start building the house (college).\n\nIf you *do* decide to go to college now, don't just ignore these issues. College counseling services are often available, and you can still work on getting your license and a phone. Maybe start with one small, achievable goal each week to build momentum.\n\nUltimately, the \"right\" choice depends on whether you can create a structured plan for a gap year that addresses your core concerns. If you can, it might be the best thing for you. If you can't, going to college and actively seeking support might be a better option. Either way, good luck!\n"

Instead of viewing it as one overwhelming project, tackle it piece by piece. Pick one new thing to learn or implement each day. This creates a gradual ramp-up rather than trying to go from 0 to 100 overnight.\n\nSet specific work blocks during your day - maybe 2-3 hours where you focus solely on the new project.

It's natural to resist a big change after a period of ease.\n\nSecond, break down the new assignment into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of looking at the whole overwhelming project, identify the very first, smallest step you can take. Maybe it's just reading the introductory documentation for 30 minutes.

Recognize that it's a common challenge and part of being human.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it takes time to build these habits. Keep experimenting with what works best for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "First off, you're definitely not alone in this struggle - it's completely normal to have work and personal life affect each other. Many people deal with this exact challenge.\n\nRather than trying to become \"less sensitive,\" which isn't really possible or healthy, let's focus on building better transitions and boundaries. Here's what works for many people:\n\nCreate a \"shutdown ritual\" at the end of your workday. This could be writing down any unfinished tasks and your plan for tomorrow, then physically closing your laptop or leaving your workspace. Think of it as closing a door on work thoughts.\n\nFor the commute home (or if working remotely, the time between work and personal life), try using that time intentionally. Listen to music, a podcast, or do some brief meditation. This acts as a buffer zone to help your mind switch gears.\n\nWhen thoughts about work pop up at home, acknowledge them briefly and then gently redirect your attention. \"Yes, that happened today, but right now I'm having dinner with my family.\" With practice, this gets easier.\n\nFor personal issues affecting work, set specific times to check in on situations (like texting your partner during lunch about their health) rather than letting worry consume you throughout the day.\n\nRemember that being affected by both spheres of your life isn't a failure - it's human. The goal isn't to build an impenetrable wall between work and personal life, but to create healthy transitions that help you be more present in each moment.",
        "llama_comment": "You're definitely not alone in struggling to separate your work and personal life - it's a common challenge many people face. One strategy that might help is to establish a clear boundary between your work and personal time, such as changing your clothes or doing a quick workout when you get home from work to signal the transition. It can also be helpful to set aside specific times to think about work or personal issues, so you're not letting them bleed into each other throughout the day. For example, you might allow yourself 30 minutes in the morning to review your work tasks and plan your day, and then try to put work out of your mind until the next day. Similarly, if you're dealing with personal issues, you might set aside some time in the evening to think about them and make a plan for how to address them, rather than letting them distract you during work hours. It's also important to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect - everyone has bad days and gets distracted sometimes. By setting clear boundaries and being kind to yourself, you can start to feel more in control and better able to manage the overlap between your work and personal life.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, you're definitely not alone in struggling with this! It's super common for work and personal life to bleed into each other. One thing that's helped me is creating clear transition rituals. For example, when leaving work, I'll listen to a specific playlist or do a quick meditation to mentally \"clock out.\" At home, maybe it's changing clothes or going for a short walk before settling in.\n\nAlso, try setting boundaries around work communication. Turn off notifications after a certain time and let your colleagues know you won't be responding to emails after hours (unless it's a genuine emergency, of course).\n\nWhen personal stuff is affecting work, schedule short breaks to address it. Instead of letting it simmer all day, take 10 minutes to call your partner or write down your feelings. Acknowledging it can sometimes help you compartmentalize it better.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's a process, and there will be days when it's harder than others. Don't beat yourself up about it; just keep practicing these strategies. You got this!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Going back to school after a long break can be daunting, but it's great that you're planning ahead! Start by setting a consistent study schedule, even if it's just an hour a day. This will help you build the habit gradually. Try using the Pomodoro Technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It can help maintain focus and prevent burnout. Also, explore different study methods like active recall and spaced repetition to see what works best for you. Lastly, consider joining study groups or online forums related to your field of study to stay motivated and engaged.

        "claude_comment": "Kudos on planning ahead for your return to school! Starting to build study habits a year in advance is a really smart move. Here's what worked well for me and many others:\n\nStart small - pick one subject you're interested in and dedicate 30 minutes each day to learning about it. This could be through free online courses, textbooks, or educational videos. The specific subject matters less than building the routine of focused learning time.\n\nCreate a dedicated study space at home, even if it's just a corner of a table. Having a consistent spot helps train your brain to focus when you sit down there. Keep it clean and organized, with good lighting and minimal distractions.\n\nTry the Pomodoro technique - study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This helps prevent burnout and makes the process less daunting. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the study intervals.\n\nPractice active recall rather than passive reading. Take notes, summarize key points in your own words, and try explaining concepts out loud. This engages your brain more effectively than just highlighting text.\n\nConsider joining a study group or finding an accountability partner, even before starting school. Local libraries often have adult learning groups, or you could connect with other returning students online.\n\nRemember - you're not starting from zero. Your work experience has taught you valuable skills like time management and problem-solving. Those will definitely help in your academic journey.\n\nStart implementing these habits now, and by the time classes begin, studying will feel much more natural. You've got this!",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to prepare yourself for going back to school. Developing study habits takes time and practice, so it's excellent that you're giving yourself a year to get into a routine. One thing you could start doing now is setting aside a dedicated time each day or week to read and learn something new, even if it's just for 15-30 minutes. This could be reading books related to your desired field, taking online courses, or watching educational videos. The key is to create a habit of consistent learning and reviewing material. You might also consider starting a journal or log to track your progress, note what works for you, and identify areas where you need improvement. Additionally, you could try reaching out to current students or professors in your desired program to get a better understanding of what to expect and how to prepare. Remember, the goal is to build gradually, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - just focus on making progress and adjusting your approach as needed.",

A year is a great runway to get back into the swing of things.\n\nInstead of jumping straight into \"studying,\" maybe start by focusing on building a routine. Pick a subject you're interested in (doesn't even have to be related to your future studies) and dedicate a small amount of time to it each day – even 15-20 minutes. Consistency is key here. Think of it like warming up a muscle.\n\nExperiment with different learning methods. Try reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, or even just having discussions with people about the topic. See what clicks for you. Also, find a study environment that works. Library, coffee shop, quiet corner at home – experiment and see what helps you focus.\n\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes or feel like you're not getting it right away. It's all part of the process.

        "claude_comment": "This is a really common struggle in the smartphone era, but there are practical ways to regain your focus. First, try putting your phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode while you work. You can customize DND settings to allow calls from specific people in case of emergencies, but texts won't create notifications to distract you.\n\nSet specific times to check and respond to messages - maybe once every few hours during breaks. This creates healthy boundaries and trains both your mind and your partner to expect responses at reasonable intervals rather than immediately.\n\nA good way to reinforce this is to keep your phone in another room while working. The physical distance makes it much harder to fall into the checking habit. If you need your phone nearby, try putting it in a drawer or somewhere out of sight.\n\nRemember that responding instantly isn't actually helping your relationship - quality time and attention are much more valuable than quick replies. By focusing on your work and personal growth, you're bringing your best self to the relationship too.\n\nStart small - try 30-minute focused work sessions where you completely ignore your phone. As this gets easier, gradually increase the duration. Your brain will adjust to these new patterns, and the urge to check messages will decrease over time.\n\nThe key is consistency in whatever system you choose. Pick an approach that feels doable and stick with it for at least a couple weeks. Your work deserves your full attention, and with practice, you can absolutely break this habit.",

This can help you break the habit of constantly waiting for a response and free up mental space for your work. Additionally, when you do catch yourself mind-wandering to the text, gently acknowledge it and refocus on your task at hand - don't beat yourself up over it, just recognize the pattern and try to shift back to what's important. It might also be helpful to have an open conversation with your partner about your communication expectations and boundaries, so you both are on the same page.

The fact that you managed to control it before shows you absolutely have the capability to do it again.\n\nFor building mental strength during this process, start really small. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, set specific times during the day when you'll stay offline - maybe just 30 minutes at first. Use this time to develop alternative coping strategies: go for a walk, do some basic exercises, read a book, or practice deep breathing. The key is having go-to activities ready for when those intrusive thoughts hit.\n\nSince you've been using the internet as a comfort mechanism since age 12, it's natural that breaking away feels extremely challenging.

Your brain isn't mush - it's been in survival mode for a long time and needs some structure to thrive. Start with one tiny routine each day, like making your bed or taking a 10-minute walk.

It's understandable that you feel lost and unsure about what you want from life right now, especially given everything you've been through. \n\nOne thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to figure out your entire life's purpose, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable goals. What are some things you enjoy doing, or things you've always wanted to try? It could be something as simple as taking a different route on your Uber Eats deliveries, or trying out a new hobby in your free time. Having something to look forward to, no matter how small it seems, can help build momentum and motivation.\n\nIt's also really important that you're recognizing the coping mechanisms you've been using (like weed and porn) might not be serving you well in the long run. That takes a lot of self-awareness, and it's a great first step towards making some positive changes. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the trauma and mental health struggles you're facing? It might be really helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and guidance as you navigate all this.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel like being alive is a burden sometimes - especially when you've been dealing with as much pain and hardship as you have. But here's the thing: you're still here, and that means you've got a chance to create a different future for yourself.

Keep taking things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't figure everything out overnight. You got this, Armando.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey Armando, that sounds like a really tough journey so far, and it takes guts to share all that. It's definitely not weird to feel like living is a burden when you've been through so much. A lot of people feel that way sometimes.\n\nIt sounds like you're in a tough spot, but also like you're ready for a change, which is huge. Since you're feeling unmotivated but know you're a hard worker, maybe try breaking things down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of thinking about a \"real job,\" could you spend 30 minutes a day just browsing job postings or updating your resume? Even that small action can build momentum.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned past trauma and mental health struggles, are you currently seeing a therapist or psychiatrist? If not, that could be a really valuable step. Even if it feels overwhelming to find one, there are online options and resources that can help you connect with someone. Taking care of your mental health is the foundation for everything else.\n\nAs for feeling like your brain is mush, maybe try incorporating some simple brain-boosting activities. Even 15 minutes of reading, doing a puzzle, or learning something new online could help you feel more engaged.\n\nDon't put too much pressure on yourself to figure everything out at once. Focus on small, consistent actions that move you in a positive direction. You've already survived a lot, and you're capable of building a better future for yourself.\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with some emotional spending, which is super common. Here are a few tips that might help you get a handle on it:\n\n1. **Awareness**: Start by tracking your spending. Use an app or a simple notebook to jot down every purchase. This will help you see patterns and understand where your money is going.\n\n2. **Budgeting**: Set a budget for yourself. Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each month. Once you hit that limit, try to hold off on more purchases.\n\n3. **Delay Gratification**: When you feel the urge to buy something, wait 24 hours before making the purchase. This can help you determine if you really need it or if it's just an impulse buy.\n\n4. **Find Alternatives**: Since shopping is a way to cope with negative feelings, try to find other activities that make you feel good. This could be exercising, reading, or even just going for a walk.\n\n5. **Set Goals**: Think about what you want to save for. Having a clear goal can make it easier to resist unnecessary purchases because you know your money is going towards something important.\n\nRemember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself as you work on building better habits. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for being open about your spending habits - recognizing the pattern is an important first step. What you're describing sounds like emotional spending, and there are practical ways to get it under control.\n\nStart by creating a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before any non-essential purchase. When you feel the urge to buy something, add it to a wishlist instead of your cart. After 24 hours, you'll often find the emotional trigger has passed and you no longer want the item.\n\nFor immediate help managing impulse buys, delete shopping apps from your phone and unsubscribe from promotional emails. These constant reminders and easy-access shopping make it much harder to break the habit.\n\nSet up automatic transfers to move money into a separate savings account as soon as you get paid. This creates a psychological barrier - you'll think twice before moving money back to spend it. Even starting with a small amount helps build the saving habit.\n\nWhen you feel those negative emotions coming on, have alternative activities ready that don't involve spending. Could be going for a walk, calling a friend, working out, or any hobby that gives you a similar mood boost. The key is breaking the automatic link between feeling bad and shopping.\n\nTrack your spending for a month in detail. Sometimes seeing the real numbers in black and white can be eye-opening and motivating. Use this to create a realistic budget that includes some \"fun money\" - being too restrictive often backfires.\n\nRemember that changing financial habits takes time. Focus on progress rather than perfection, and be proud of each small win along the way.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're using shopping as a way to cope with negative emotions, which is a pretty common phenomenon. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - in your case, it seems like feeling sad or mad at someone can set you off. When you feel those emotions coming on, try to pause and do something else instead of reaching for your wallet. This could be going for a walk, calling a friend, or doing some exercise - anything that can help distract you from the urge to shop. \n\nAnother thing you might find helpful is to implement a 30-day rule: when you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before actually making the purchase. This can help you figure out if the item is something you really need or if the desire to buy it was just an impulsive want. You could also try setting up a budget and prioritizing your spending - make a list of what you need to save for, and see if you can allocate your money towards those goals instead of impulse purchases.\n\nIt might also be helpful to find other ways to cope with your emotions that don't involve spending money. Could you try journaling, meditation, or talking to a therapist? These can be really powerful tools for managing negative feelings without breaking the bank. Remember, developing self-control and better spending habits takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't get too discouraged if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and keep moving forward.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to use shopping as a way to cope, but it definitely sounds like you're ready to make a change.\n\nFirst, try to identify your triggers. You mentioned feeling sad or mad – keep a little journal for a week or two and jot down what you're feeling right before you get the urge to shop. Recognizing those feelings is the first step.\n\nNext, create some friction. Unsubscribe from marketing emails, delete shopping apps from your phone, and maybe even avoid going to the mall if that's a trigger. The harder it is to shop impulsively, the better.\n\nAlso, try to find healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of shopping when you're feeling down, try going for a walk, listening to music, or talking to a friend. It might not give you the same immediate rush, but it'll be better for you in the long run.\n\nFinally, set some financial goals. Having a specific reason to save money (like a vacation, a new car, or just a safety net) can make it easier to resist impulse buys. Maybe even create a separate savings account specifically for that goal and track your progress. You got this!\n"

Some things might need to wait until you have more time or energy - and that's perfectly fine.

Maybe watching movies isn't as important as reading books, or vice versa. Don't feel pressured to do things just because you think you *should*.\n\nFinally, remember to schedule in rest and downtime.

Many people have faced similar challenges and found a way through.\n\nStart small to regain some control and build momentum. Consider setting a simple daily routine that includes a few non-work activities you enjoy or want to try. This could be a short walk, reading a book, or even learning something new online that interests you. These small steps can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\n\nConnecting with others, even virtually, can also make a big difference. Try reaching out to old friends or joining online communities related to your interests. It might feel awkward at first, but it can help rebuild your social life and provide some support.\n\nRegarding your career, it's never too late to pivot or explore new opportunities. Reflect on what you truly enjoy and consider taking small steps towards that path, whether it's through online courses or networking with people in that field.\n\nLastly, if you're feeling persistently low, it might be helpful to talk to a professional who can provide guidance tailored to your situation.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there. Your situation sounds really challenging, but it's good that you're reaching out. Let's break this down into manageable pieces you can actually work on.\n\nFirst, the isolation needs to be addressed. Since you're working remotely, you'll need to be proactive about creating social connections. Consider joining local meetup groups or sports clubs - even in a small town, there are usually some activities happening. If tech meetups aren't available locally, start with virtual ones. This gives you both social interaction and professional networking.\n\nFor your career situation - you're not as stuck as you might think. Many electronics engineers transition into embedded systems or IoT roles, which could blend your original degree with your current IT experience. Start exploring these hybrid roles. They often offer better work-life balance and could feel more meaningful to you.\n\nThe daily grind becomes more manageable when you have something to work towards. Set aside 30 minutes each morning (before work) to work on a personal project or study something you're genuinely interested in. This gives you a sense of progress outside of work deadlines.\n\nFor the immediate term, create a simple evening routine. Go for a 20-minute walk after work, do some basic exercises, and try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Physical movement helps clear your head and improves sleep quality, which directly impacts motivation.\n\nDon't compare yourself to others' timelines. Instead, focus on small, daily improvements. Start tracking these improvements - whether it's learning something new, making a new connection, or just maintaining your routine. Small wins build momentum.\n\nRemember that seeking professional help for ADHD is a perfectly valid step - proper support could make a significant difference in your daily functioning and decision-making.\n\nTake it one day at a time. Focus on building one good habit this week. Then add another next week. It's not about massive changes - it's about consistent, small steps forward.",

Instead of feeling like you need to tackle everything at once, try focusing on one area of your life that you'd like to improve. For example, you could start by setting aside some time each day to work on a personal project or hobby that brings you joy. This could be anything from learning a new programming language to working on a creative project.\n\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that help you relax and reduce stress. Exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature can all be great ways to improve your mood and energy levels. Since you mentioned feeling lonely, you might consider joining online communities or forums related to your interests - this could be a good way to connect with others who share your passions.\n\nIn terms of your career, it might be helpful to explore ways to make your current job more engaging or fulfilling. Could you talk to your manager about taking on new challenges or responsibilities? Or, you could start looking into other job opportunities that might be a better fit for your skills and interests.\n\nLastly, don't give up on reaching out to your friends and family, even if it feels like they're not responding the way you'd like.

Even without a diagnosis, look into ADHD-friendly productivity techniques like breaking tasks into smaller steps, using timers (Pomodoro), and minimizing distractions.\n\nRegarding your career, it's great that you recognize the need to keep learning. Instead of viewing it as a burden, could you reframe it as an opportunity?

Even 30 minutes a day can make a difference and give you a sense of progress.\n\nSocially, it's tough when everyone else seems to be on a different path. Instead of comparing yourself to your cousins, focus on building your own connections. Since you're in your hometown, are there any local groups or activities you could join based on your interests?

        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many people hit similar ruts, especially during important transition periods like preparing for grad school. The good news is that you're aware of the patterns and actively seeking change.\n\nLet's start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE thing to focus on for the next week. Given your grad exam priority, I'd suggest starting with studying. Set a ridiculously easy goal - like studying for just 25 minutes each morning. That's it. Don't worry about the gym or other habits yet.\n\nThe key is rebuilding trust with yourself through small wins. When you consistently hit that 25-minute target, you'll start believing in your own promises again. Use the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. During those 25 minutes, put your phone in another room and block distracting websites.\n\nFor the gaming and YouTube habits - don't try to quit cold turkey. Instead, make them rewards. After completing your study session, give yourself permission to play for a set amount of time. This helps break the cycle of guilt and creates positive reinforcement.\n\nRegarding consistency - forget about perfect streaks. If you miss a day, just pick up where you left off the next morning. Think of it like GPS navigation - when you take a wrong turn, it doesn't berate you, it just recalculates the route.\n\nConsider finding an accountability partner - maybe another student preparing for grad exams. Sometimes external accountability can help bridge the gap while rebuilding self-trust.\n\nRemember: progress isn't linear. Focus on taking small, consistent steps rather than massive changes.

This could be something as simple as studying for 10 minutes, or going for a short walk outside. The idea is to build momentum and start to rebuild your sense of self-efficacy.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that consistency is not an all-or-nothing thing. Just because you have a setback on the third or fourth day doesn't mean you've failed. It means you're human, and you're going to have ups and downs. The key is to learn from those setbacks and keep moving forward.\n\nIn terms of your studying, you might find it helpful to create a schedule and stick to it, at least for a few hours a day. Break your study sessions into smaller chunks, and take regular breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing. This can help make the process feel less overwhelming.\n\nLastly, don't give up on talking to friends about your struggles. It's possible that they're not taking you seriously because they don't understand what you're going through, but that doesn't mean you should stop reaching out. You might consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and supportive space to discuss your issues.\n\nRemember, getting out of a rut takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't expect to change everything overnight. You got this, and you can start making progress one small step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a great first step. It's super common to feel this way, especially with the pressure of grad school looming.\n\nFirst, be kind to yourself. You're not alone in struggling with consistency. Instead of aiming for huge changes, try micro-wins. Seriously, tiny steps. Like, instead of \"study for 8 hours,\" aim for 15 minutes. Set a timer, no distractions. When it goes off, you're done. You can always do another 15 later if you feel up to it. The goal is to break the inertia.\n\nRegarding the other habits, try replacing instead of just stopping. If you're reaching for the video games, have a book or a quick workout ready to go instead. Even just 10 push-ups can shift your focus. For the pornography addiction, there are some great subreddits and resources out there (I can't link them here, but a quick search will find them) that offer support and strategies.\n\nAs for your friends not taking you seriously, that's frustrating. Maybe try framing it differently, like \"Hey, I'm really trying to make some changes, and I'd appreciate it if you could just listen without judgment.\" If they still don't get it, maybe find a study buddy or online community where people are working towards similar goals.\n\nThe key is to build momentum with small, achievable goals. Don't beat yourself up when you slip up – just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You've got this!\n"

I've been trying out different habit trackers but struggle to find one that fits my needs.\n\nI would like it to have most or all of the following functions:\n\n- be able to add both one-time tasks and habit chains\n\n- be able to add subtasks and -goals\n\n- be able to add non-tracked tasks and appointments\n\n- be able to set a deadline for tasks with reminder notifications and graphics (such as bright red text) for when a task is near its deadline\n\n- be able to use the app as a calendar\n\n- be able to use images or imagery\n\n- that it has widgets\n\n- that it works on Android\n\n\nSo far I've enjoyed Fabulous for habit formation. Its imagery depicting a journey really works for me. Unfortunately it's only for habits, not tasks. I really would prefer not to have to use several apps for this.\n\nI recently found HabitNow that comes really close to what I'm looking for, but I find its graphics uninspiring and tasks only show up in the daily list if you don't assign a deadline for some reason. Also, you can only get reminders on the day of the deadline and not before, which is lacking for me.\n\nIdeally the app would show a list of items each day like the following example:\n\n\nTuesday\n\nPay rent (monthly task, this day at the top and in bright red because deadline is next day)\n\nFloss (habit tracking)\n\nGo to the gym (also habit tracking) \n\nMovie night (one time task, set on this specific day) \n\nBuy a new umbrella (another one time task, set to show up as a reminder every day until it is completed)\n\n\nI am aware that what I'm looking for might not exist, but I'm very appreciative of any suggestions!",

Based on your requirements, you might want to check out \"TickTick.\" It’s a versatile app that combines task management with habit tracking and has a calendar view. You can set deadlines, reminders, and even use widgets. It also works on Android and allows for subtasks and goals. While it might not have the same journey-style imagery as Fabulous, it’s pretty customizable, so you might be able to tweak it to make it more visually appealing for you. Another option could be \"Todoist,\" which is great for task management and has some habit tracking features. It’s not as visually driven, but it’s very functional and might meet most of your needs. Good luck, and I hope you find the right fit!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for the detailed breakdown of what you're looking for! Based on your requirements, I'd recommend checking out TickTick. It hits most of your criteria - you can track both habits and one-time tasks, set subtasks, use it as a calendar, and get customizable reminders before deadlines. The interface includes visual elements and widgets for Android, though not quite as journey-focused as Fabulous.\n\nAnother solid option worth considering is Microsoft To Do. While it's not primarily marketed as a habit tracker, you can create recurring tasks for habits, set due dates with advance reminders, and organize everything with subtasks. The interface is clean and it handles your example scenario really well.\n\nIf you're willing to try something a bit different, Notion can be customized to do everything you've described. There's more of a learning curve, but you can design it exactly how you want, including adding whatever images and visual elements motivate you most. The mobile app works well on Android and you can create widgets.\n\nThe key is finding a system that you'll actually stick with long-term. Even a slightly imperfect tool that you use consistently will serve you better than a \"perfect\" one that feels like a chore. Maybe try one of these for a couple weeks and see how it fits into your routine?",
        "llama_comment": "You're looking for an all-in-one habit tracker and task manager that's both functional and visually appealing. I totally get why you'd want to avoid using multiple apps. Have you considered checking out Todoist or Trello? Both have Android apps and offer a wide range of features, including the ability to add one-time tasks, habit chains, subtasks, and goals. They also allow you to set deadlines with reminder notifications and use calendars to organize your tasks. Todoist has a more traditional task management approach, while Trello uses a board-based system that might appeal to you if you like visualizing your tasks. Additionally, you could look into Any.do or TickTick, which offer similar features and have customizable widgets. As for the graphics and imagery, some of these apps allow you to add images or customize the appearance, so it might be worth exploring their settings to see if you can make them more inspiring. It's also worth noting that you could try using a digital planner or bullet journal app like Evernote or OneNote, which offer a lot of flexibility in terms of customization and organization. I'd love to hear if any of these options resonate with you, or if you've already tried them and are looking for something else!",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey! Finding the right habit tracker can be a real pain, so I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've put in some solid effort already.\n\nSince you like the visual journey aspect of Fabulous, maybe you could try pairing it with a separate task manager that handles the more complex scheduling and reminders you need. It might not be ideal to use two apps, but if Fabulous really motivates you for habit formation, it could be worth it.\n\nFor the task manager, have you looked into TickTick? It's available on Android, has pretty robust task management features (subtasks, deadlines, reminders), and a calendar view. I'm not sure about the exact level of visual customization you're looking for, but it does offer some theming options and widgets. You can definitely set recurring tasks and one-off tasks with specific deadlines and reminders.\n\nAnother option to consider is Todoist. It's also available on Android and has a lot of the features you mentioned, including subtasks, deadlines, and reminders. It might not be as visually driven as Fabulous, but it's a solid choice for managing tasks and projects.\n\nUltimately, the best app is the one you'll actually use consistently. Maybe try a free trial of TickTick or Todoist and see if they click for you. Good luck with your search!\n"

        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I totally get the challenge of balancing housework responsibilities with everything else. The good news is that procrastination and time management are skills we can improve with the right approach.\n\nStart by breaking down your tasks into really small chunks. Instead of \"do assignment,\" try \"write introduction paragraph\" or \"research 3 sources.\" For housework, maybe \"clean kitchen counter\" rather than \"clean kitchen.\" These smaller tasks feel way more manageable.\n\nA technique that might help is the \"2-minute rule\" - if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This builds momentum and prevents small tasks from piling up. For bigger tasks, try working in 25-minute focused blocks (Pomodoro technique), then take a 5-minute break.\n\nSince you mentioned having 1-2 hours of housework, try to establish a consistent time for it. Maybe right after breakfast or before dinner. This creates routine and removes the mental burden of deciding when to do it.\n\nFor deadlines, use a simple calendar or task list (digital or paper) and work backwards. If an assignment is due Friday, mark mini-deadlines: research by Tuesday, rough draft by Wednesday, etc. This prevents that last-minute rush.\n\nRemember - you don't need to transform overnight. Pick one small change to implement this week. Maybe it's the 2-minute rule, or setting mini-deadlines. Build from there. You've already taken the first step by recognizing what needs to change.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation, especially with the added responsibility of housework on top of your other tasks. One thing that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and then schedule them into your day. This can make it feel less overwhelming and allow you to focus on one thing at a time. For example, you could allocate specific times for housework, work, and study, and try to stick to those times as much as possible. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like \"I will work on this task for 25 minutes without any distractions,\" and then take a short break before coming back to it. This can help you build momentum and make progress without feeling too overwhelmed. Additionally, you might consider talking to your family about your workload and seeing if there's a way to distribute the housework more evenly, or find ways to make it more efficient so it takes up less of your time.

        "claude_comment": "External accountability is a powerful motivator, and it's totally normal to struggle with self-imposed deadlines. Here's what's worked really well for me and others: get an accountability partner. Find a friend, family member, or colleague who can check in on your progress. Set clear deadlines with them and schedule regular check-ins. The key is making it official - actually put it in both of your calendars and treat it like any other important commitment.\n\nAnother effective approach is breaking down your work into smaller chunks with mini-deadlines. Instead of one big deadline that feels distant and abstract, create a schedule with specific milestones. For example, if you're working on a project, decide \"I'll complete the outline by Wednesday, first draft by Friday\" etc.\n\nYou can also try time-blocking your calendar. Actually schedule your tasks like appointments with yourself. This creates structure and makes the deadlines feel more concrete. Plus, seeing the blocked time serves as a visual reminder of your commitments.\n\nThe most important thing is to start small. Don't try to overhaul everything at once.

When it comes to gaining muscle mass, consistency is key, even if your schedule is tight. Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Meal Prep**: Try preparing your meals in advance. You can cook in bulk on weekends or whenever you have some free time. This way, you can have calorie-dense meals ready to go, which can help you hit your calorie goals without having to cook every day.\n\n2. **Calorie-Dense Foods**: Incorporate more calorie-dense foods into your diet. Things like nuts, seeds, avocados, and whole grains can help you increase your calorie intake without feeling like you're eating a ton of food.\n\n3. **Smoothies**: Consider making smoothies with protein powder, fruits, oats, and nut butter. They're quick to make, easy to consume, and can pack a lot of calories and nutrients.\n\n4. **Snacking**: Keep healthy snacks with you throughout the day. Things like protein bars, trail mix, or yogurt can be great for getting extra calories in between meals.\n\n5. **Efficient Workouts**: Since you can only hit the gym twice a week, focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups. This will maximize your time and help you build muscle more effectively.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's great that you're already on the right path.

That's seriously impressive and shows you've got what it takes to make positive changes.\n\nFor your specific situation with calories and gym time, here are some practical workarounds:\n\nMeal prep is going to be your best friend. On weekends, prepare several days worth of high-calorie meals and snacks. Pack portable options you can easily eat during your commute or between classes - think nuts, protein bars, peanut butter sandwiches, or protein shakes.\n\nSpeaking of shakes - they're a game changer for getting calories in when you're busy. Mix protein powder, oats, peanut butter, banana, and whole milk. You can easily get 800-1000 calories in one shake. Make it the night before and drink it during your morning commute.\n\nAs for only having 2 gym days - that's totally workable for a beginner. Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc.) to maximize your limited gym time. The key is consistency with those 2 days rather than trying to force more sessions into an already packed schedule.\n\nRemember that building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. Small, sustainable changes you can maintain will get you much further than trying to make dramatic changes that burn you out. Start with getting your breakfast and post-school nutrition sorted, then build from there.\n\nWhen you're feeling overwhelmed, just focus on the next meal, the next workout.

Now, tackling your nutrition and fitness goals is a fantastic next step. Given your busy schedule and limited time for the gym, it's essential to focus on making the most of your diet and workouts. \n\nFirstly, consider meal prepping or planning your meals in advance, especially for breakfast and post-school snacks. This can help ensure you're getting a balanced mix of nutrients even on hectic days. You might also look into calorie-dense foods that are easy to consume quickly, such as nuts, dried fruits, or energy bars, to help meet your daily caloric needs without feeling too full.\n\nFor your gym days, prioritize compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, which work multiple muscle groups at once. This will help you make the most of your limited gym time. Additionally, look into bodyweight exercises or resistance band workouts that you can do on your non-gym days to keep your muscles active.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the importance of rest and recovery. With a stressful schedule, it's crucial to get enough sleep (aim for 7-9 hours) and allow your muscles time to recover between workouts. This will help your body adapt to the demands you're placing on it and support muscle growth.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key. You've already shown that you can make significant changes in your life, so apply that same determination to your fitness journey. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two - just get back on track as soon as you can. Good luck!",

Don't feel like you need to hit that number perfectly every single day. Consistency is key, not perfection.\n\nSince mornings are tough, could you prep a high-calorie shake the night before? Throw in some protein powder, oats, banana, peanut butter, and milk (or a dairy-free alternative). It's quick to drink on the go and packs a lot of calories.\n\nFor when you get home, try to break down your studying into smaller chunks. Maybe eat a quick, calorie-dense snack (nuts, Greek yogurt, etc.) *before* you start studying. That way, you're fueling your brain and body. Then, set a timer for 25 minutes of focused studying, followed by a 5-minute break. During the break, you could have another small snack. This can make the whole process less overwhelming.\n\nAlso, two gym days are better than zero! Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows) to get the most bang for your buck. Make sure you're progressively overloading (lifting slightly heavier or doing more reps each week).\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. Building muscle takes time and consistency. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. Keep showing up, keep making small improvements, and you'll get there. Good luck!\n"

I have the ability to succeed academically when I apply myself, it just feels like a near impossible task to ever sit down and do it whenever it's not a high stakes situation. How can I channel even a fraction of the discipline and enthusiasm I have for fitness into studying and learning?",

        "best_comment": "Hey there! \n\nThis is a fantastic question. \n\nAlthough I’m now doing college consulting and academic coaching, I no no longer teach in a classroom setting. \n\nNonetheless, I’ve noticed a lot of my students have the same problem you have. They can listen to an interesting documentary about the fall of Babylon because it’s fun; or, they can read gushy romance manwhas in class for forever and a half.\n\nHowever, even 2 minutes writing an analytical essay on Of Mice and Men is like pulling teeth! \n\nI believe this is because students are often unfamiliar with the different kinds of motivation. There’s the “fun” motivation and there’s the “flow state” motivation. (These aren’t official terms btw I just made them up) \n\nFun motivation is when you’ve finished grading papers for the day and can sit at home playing Skyrim for hours until night. Your mind finds the activity engaging and therefore can do it for a long period of time. \n\nThe “flow state” of motivation is when your mind is at peace. There’s no distractions; and, you can do seemingly boring tasks for a long stretch of time. You’re not really happy; but, you’re not in pain either. You’re just at peace. A good analogy for this is to think of long distance running. The first bit sucks. But, later on, you don’t really feel fatigued from running anymore. It’s not super good or bad; it just… is. \n\nThe flow state may never be as engaging as fun. Academic tasks may never be as fun as fitness. Learning about derivatives is probably not as fun as playing God of War. \n\nBut, you can condition yourself to become accustomed to the flow state. So, you mind can bear the burden of boredom and find it tolerable rather than torture. \n\nOne method I recommend for this is to eat bland food. It sounds weird. But, next time you have to decide what to eat, choose the second best option. \n\nSushi —> cooked salmon \nIn n Out Burgers —> Mc Donald’s\nBoba —> Lemonade\n\nThe reason you do this is to condition the mind to get accustomed to not having its way. It’ll learn that not having the #1 choice isn’t the end of the world. You can apply this principle elsewhere as well. \n\nNeed to take a break? Don’t play video games. Instead, sleep or take a walk. This compromise can help the mind be less spoiled and be more likely to do boring tasks even if it doesn’t want to, making the flow state easier. You can also apply the principle of depriving instant gratification to the Pomodoro method and many others. \n\nAlso, final note: remember that this is going to take time. Your mind doesn’t get trained within a day, and you’re going to have days of relapse. A good analogy is fitness and bodybuilders. They often have days when they can be disciplined such as cutting for a show. But, they relapse every so often! It’s natural, and mistakes are going to be part of the process! \n\nLet me know if you have any questions at all!",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Your narratives (I hate it, it makes me anxious, its not fun) are probably acting as a self fulfilling prophecy.\n      \nDefinitely need to reframe those to stimulate the reward centres of your brain. \n      \nTry breaking academic tasks into small chunks (eg 20mins at a time to do one tasks) so that you can get a sense of reward from smashing them out. \n      \nWith practice it does become easier. It's brain training to push past the 5 minute point and every time you do it you get better at it.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you've got a great handle on fitness, which is awesome. The key is to try and transfer some of that mindset to your academic work. One approach is to treat your study sessions like a workout. Set specific goals for each session, just like you would with fitness. Start with small, manageable tasks and gradually increase the difficulty as you build your \"academic stamina.\" You can also try to create a routine or ritual around studying, similar to how you might have a pre-workout routine. This could be as simple as having a dedicated study space or a specific time of day when you always hit the books. Lastly, try to find ways to make studying more engaging. This could be through active learning techniques, like teaching the material to someone else, or using apps and tools that gamify the learning process. Remember, it's all about consistency and finding what works for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "The key is to start treating your academic work like you treat your fitness - as something that makes you stronger and builds your capabilities over time. Just like you track PRs in the gym, try setting concrete study goals and tracking your progress. Start with 25-minute focused study blocks (like sets in the gym) and gradually build up your \"academic endurance.\"\n\nYou already know how to push through physical discomfort for gains - now apply that same mindset to pushing through mental resistance. That anxious feeling when sitting down to study? Think of it like pre-workout jitters. The urge to quit after 5 minutes? Similar to that voice telling you to rack the weights early. You've learned to push past these in fitness, and you can develop the same mental toughness for academics.\n\nConsider creating a reward system where you earn your workout time by completing study sessions. This leverages your existing motivation for fitness to build momentum with academics. You could also try studying in different environments, like at the gym between sets or right after a workout when you're feeling accomplished and energized.\n\nRemember that just like fitness results compound over time, so do academic gains. Small, consistent study sessions will build up your focus and knowledge base, just like consistent training builds muscle and strength. You've already proven you have the discipline gene - now it's just about applying it to a different domain.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you've already developed a strong sense of discipline and motivation in one area of your life, which is awesome. One strategy you could try is to identify what specifically drives your motivation for fitness - is it the feeling of accomplishment, the thrill of competition, or something else? Once you pinpoint that, see if you can apply similar principles to your academic tasks. For example, if you love pushing yourself to break PRs, maybe set specific, challenging goals for your studying, like mastering a certain concept within a week. Additionally, try to make your study sessions more engaging by incorporating elements that work for you in fitness, such as tracking progress, creating a routine, or finding a study buddy to provide accountability and support. It might also be helpful to start small, dedicating a short amount of time each day to academic tasks and gradually increasing the duration as you build momentum. Lastly, consider exploring different learning methods, like watching video lectures or working on practical projects, which might make studying feel more enjoyable and interactive, similar to how you approach fitness.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that's a really common problem! It sounds like you've already got the discipline muscle built, just gotta redirect it. Here's a thought: try framing your academic tasks like fitness challenges.\n\nInstead of thinking \"I have to study for 3 hours,\" think \"I'm going to do 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute 'active recovery' break where I get up and move around.\" Use a timer – the Pomodoro Technique is great for this. The short bursts might make it less daunting.\n\nAlso, what kind of rewards do you give yourself after a good workout? Can you apply something similar to studying? Maybe after finishing a chapter, you get to watch an episode of your favorite show, or listen to a song you love.\n\nFinally, try to identify *why* you hate studying. Is it the subject matter? The environment? The feeling of being overwhelmed? Once you pinpoint the root cause, you can start to address it directly. Maybe you need to find a study buddy, change your study location, or break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Good luck, you got this!\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a unique position with a lot of freedom but also a lot of uncertainty. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Identify Key Areas**: Start by listing out the main areas of your business that need attention. This could be sales, marketing, product development, etc. Once you have these, you can start to see where your time might be best spent.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Even if your company doesn't set goals, you can set personal ones. Think about what success looks like for you and your team. Is it increasing revenue, improving customer satisfaction, or something else?\n\n3. **Time Blocking**: Try time blocking your day. Dedicate specific chunks of time to different tasks or areas. This can help you focus and ensure you're giving attention to all necessary parts of your business.\n\n4. **Weekly Reviews**: At the end of each week, review what you accomplished and what needs more attention. This can help you adjust your priorities for the following week.\n\n5. **Consider a Coach**: If you feel like you need more structured guidance, a business coach could be a great investment. They can provide an outside perspective and help you develop a more strategic approach to your work.\n\nYou might also want to check out platforms like LinkedIn or local business networks to find a coach or accountability partner. Good luck, and remember, it's all about finding a system that works for you!",
        "claude_comment": "You're on the right track recognizing that you need a systematic approach to prioritization. While a business coach could definitely help, here are some immediate steps you can take:\n\nFirst, try implementing the Eisenhower Matrix for a week. Divide your tasks into four quadrants: urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not urgent/not important. This will help you identify what actually moves the needle for your business versus what just feels busy.\n\nFor revenue-producing activities specifically, track everything you do for 2-3 days, noting the approximate revenue impact of each activity. You'll likely find that 20% of your activities generate 80% of your results (Pareto Principle). These become your priorities.\n\nAs for structuring your day, time-blocking works well for autonomous roles. Set specific hours for your high-priority work when you're most productive. For example, dedicate your first 3 hours to your top revenue-generating activities before touching anything else.\n\nFor coaching, look into Vistage or similar executive coaching groups - they specialize in exactly what you're describing. They can help establish KPIs and create accountability systems tailored to your business.\n\nIn the meantime, start each day by writing down your top 3 revenue-impacting tasks. Don't move on to lower-priority items until these are complete. This simple habit can make a huge difference in your productivity and business growth.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're looking for help with prioritization and task management, which is a great step towards taking control of your day. Before hiring a coach, you might want to try implementing a simple framework like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize your tasks into urgent vs important and focus on the high-priority ones first. Additionally, you could start by identifying your core business's key performance indicators (KPIs) and aligning your daily tasks with those goals. This can help you determine which activities are likely to generate the most revenue. \n\nYou might also consider using a tool like a planner or an app like Trello or Asana to schedule and track your tasks, and set aside dedicated time for planning and review each day or week. If after trying these strategies you still feel like you need personalized guidance, then hiring a coach could be a good investment. Some popular options for finding a business coach or accountability partner include websites like Clarity.fm, Coach.me, or even local business networking groups. Have you considered reaching out to your company's leadership to see if they'd be open to setting some clear goals and objectives, which could also help guide your prioritization?",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, that sounds like a common problem when you have a lot of freedom but not a lot of structure. It's great that you're recognizing the need for a system.\n\nFinding a coach or accountability partner is a solid idea. Since you're looking for someone with a process, maybe search for business coaches who specialize in productivity or time management for entrepreneurs or small business owners. Look for testimonials or case studies that highlight their ability to help clients prioritize tasks and create daily structures.\n\nIn the meantime, you could try a few things yourself. Start by listing *everything* you do in a week, even the small stuff. Then, try categorizing those tasks by impact on revenue (high, medium, low). This will give you a clearer picture of where your time is actually going. From there, you can start experimenting with time blocking – dedicating specific blocks of time to high-impact activities.

        "claude_comment": "Here's what helped me break the endless scrolling cycle: start by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete social media apps and only access them through your browser. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less appealing.\n\nNext, create \"speed bumps\" that make you pause before mindlessly grabbing your phone. Move social media apps into a folder on your second or third home screen. Set up app timers (both iPhone and Android have these built in). Put a rubber band or sticky note on your phone as a physical reminder to ask \"do I really need to check this right now?\"\n\nThe key is replacing the habit with something else when you need breaks. Keep a book nearby, do some quick stretches, or even just close your eyes for 2 minutes. These alternatives can still give you that mental breather without sucking you into the scroll vortex.\n\nStart small - try setting a 15-minute daily limit on your most-used social media app. Once that feels manageable, gradually reduce limits on other apps. You'll likely slip up sometimes, but that's normal. Just reset and try again the next day.\n\nRemember: your phone should be a tool that serves you, not the other way around.

You could also try removing social media apps from your phone's home screen or using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl to limit your access to certain sites during certain hours of the day. Another approach is to replace social media with a different habit when you feel tired or need a break, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises.

Once you know the trigger, you can find a healthier alternative. Maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or listening to a song.\n\nThird, make it harder to access social media. Delete the apps from your phone and only access them on your computer (which is less convenient). Or, use app blockers to limit your time on specific apps.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself.

        "claude_comment": "It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of only responding to immediate threats rather than developing sustainable work habits.

Consider whether you'd rather redirect your energy toward finding a role that energizes you naturally.\n\nIf you decide to stay, here's what can help break the threat-response cycle:\n\nStart incredibly small. Pick one tiny work task that takes 10 minutes or less. Do it first thing every morning, no exceptions. This builds momentum and gives you a small win to start the day. Once that becomes automatic (usually takes about 2 weeks), add another small task.\n\nCreate artificial deadlines for yourself. Break larger projects into smaller chunks with self-imposed deadlines. Share these deadlines with a colleague or your boss to add accountability. This mimics the urgency that currently only comes from threats, but in a controlled way.\n\nSet up a reward system that isn't dependent on external perks. Maybe 25 minutes of focused work earns you a 5-minute break to do something you enjoy. This helps retrain your brain to associate work with positive outcomes rather than just avoiding negative ones.\n\nRemember: sustainable discipline comes from systems, not willpower.

Since threats are the only thing that seem to motivate you, maybe you can create artificial \"threats\" for yourself. Try setting really strict deadlines for yourself, and if you miss them, impose a consequence you actually care about. Like, donate to a cause you *don't* support, or skip one of those fancy dinners.

I have lost the respect I once had of being a good player. Now no one even thinks about me, and no one wants to take me in their team. I feel like an outcast.

I think something is highly wrong with me, because I just can't do things I want to do. Why am I like this? I have no respect for left for me, and I don't know why I am writing this. Maybe I just want to tell someone how I feel. I feel completely destroyed from inside. Day by day my respect decreases for myself. I try to not compare myself with anyone but myself, but then I think I'm extremely slow and if others can improve then I should too. 6 years is a lot of time. I am only escaping my reality, and when I face it then I go back to escaping it even harder.\n\nDue to this mentality, I am not eating well, and taking care of myself.

A lot of women in recent years found out that made them depressed as well.\n\nI think before you conclude it's just your motivation, rule out any physiological causes, because you won't be able to will yourself out of a biological problem or deficiency. You may even have had it for so long you think your energy levels are normal when they're not (and people will look down on you for being lazy and unmotivated when it's really not in your control at all).\n\nAlso that's why it's even more important that you start to eat regularly and healthy again, even if you don't feel like it, because motivation really is tightly coupled to your energy intake. Eat well.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to acknowledge how hard it is to feel stuck like this. First off, it's important to remember that everyone struggles at some point, and you're not alone in feeling this way. It might help to start with small, manageable changes. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small thing you can do each day. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 5 minutes to study or going for a short walk. The key is consistency, not perfection.\n\nWhen it comes to studying, try to create a routine that makes it easier to start. Maybe set up a specific time and place where you study every day, and remove distractions as much as possible. For the gym, focus on your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others. Everyone's journey is different, and improvement can be slow and steady.\n\nAs for your friendships, it might be worth having an honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Sometimes, just opening up can help rebuild connections. And remember, respect often starts with how you treat yourself. Try to be kind to yourself and recognize the small wins along the way.\n\nLastly, if you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to talk to a professional who can provide support and guidance. You're taking a big step by reaching out here, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and take it one day at a time. You've got this.",
        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people go through periods where they feel stuck and disconnected from their potential. The good news is that you've already taken some positive steps - you've been consistently going to the gym for 6 months, which shows you're capable of building good habits.\n\nLet's start small. Really small. Forget about comparing yourself to others or trying to fix everything at once. Pick ONE tiny thing you can do today. Maybe it's studying for just 5 minutes (not 10), or making your bed, or drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. The goal isn't to transform overnight - it's to prove to yourself that you can follow through on something, no matter how minor it seems.\n\nFor your studies, try the Pomodoro technique but modified - start with just one 5-minute session per day. Set a specific time (like right after breakfast) and stick to it. After a week, try two 5-minute sessions. Build gradually.\n\nRegarding your gym partner and sports - sometimes when we're struggling internally, we project that onto our relationships and performance. Focus on showing up consistently and doing what you can. Progress isn't linear - everyone plateaus sometimes.\n\nConsider talking to your university's counseling services. What you're describing sounds a lot like depression, and getting professional support could help you break this cycle. They can also help you make a plan for your academic situation.\n\nRemember - respect isn't about being the best at everything. It's about being someone who keeps trying, who owns their mistakes, and who takes small steps forward even when it's difficult. Start treating yourself with the same patience you'd show a good friend who was struggling.\n\nTake one small action today. Just one. Then do it again tomorrow. That's how change begins.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to share something as personal as this, so thank you for being honest about how you're feeling. It sounds like you're struggling with a deep sense of inadequacy and self-doubt, which is making it hard for you to motivate yourself to make positive changes in your life. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean there's anything fundamentally wrong with you. Many people struggle with similar feelings, and it's possible to work through them.\n\nOne thing that stands out is that you've been trying to change yourself for six years, but you haven't seen the progress you want. This can be really frustrating, but instead of beating yourself up over it, maybe it's time to try a different approach. Rather than focusing on all the things you're not doing well, what if you started small and focused on one or two areas where you'd like to see improvement? For example, you mentioned that going to the gym was a good decision - what if you built on that by setting a specific, achievable goal for yourself, like increasing your workout frequency or intensity by a small amount each week?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that respect from others often starts with self-respect. When you take care of yourself and do things that make you feel good about who you are, you're more likely to earn the respect of others. This doesn't mean you need to be perfect or have all the answers - it just means you need to be willing to show up for yourself and try your best.\n\nIn terms of your daily habits, it might be helpful to start tracking what you're doing each day, including how you're spending your time and what you're eating. Sometimes, just becoming more aware of our patterns can help us identify areas where we'd like to make changes. You could also try setting a few simple, achievable goals for yourself each day, like taking a short walk or doing a few push-ups.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling - not just about the specifics of your situation, but about the emotions that are underlying everything. A therapist or counselor could provide you with a safe and supportive space to explore these feelings and work through them. Remember, you don't have to do this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to be this honest about it. It's understandable that you feel lost and overwhelmed right now.\n\nFirst off, be kind to yourself. You're recognizing these issues, which is the first and hardest step. Don't beat yourself up for past failures; focus on what you can do *today*.\n\nIt sounds like you're trying to tackle everything at once, which can be paralyzing. Instead of aiming for massive changes, try focusing on one tiny, manageable thing. You mentioned struggling with studying even for 10 minutes. Okay, how about 5? Seriously. Set a timer for 5 minutes, open your book, and just *look* at the page. No pressure to understand it, just be present with it for those 5 minutes. The goal isn't to master the material, it's to build the habit of showing up.\n\nThe same goes for the gym. Forget about what your partner is lifting. Focus on *your* personal best from *last week*. Can you beat that by even one rep? That's a win. Small, consistent progress is key.\n\nRegarding your friend, maybe try a sincere apology. Acknowledge that you realize you've been negative and that you value the friendship. It might not fix things instantly, but it's a start.\n\nAs for feeling like no one respects you, respect is often earned through competence and contribution. But you can't contribute if you're stuck in this cycle. Start small, build momentum, and the respect will follow.\n\nFinally, consider talking to a professional. You mentioned feeling depressed, and a therapist can provide tools and support to help you break free from these patterns. There's no shame in asking for help. You're not alone in this.\n"

        "gpt_comment": "Deleting TikTok can definitely be a challenge, especially when it's become a go-to for stress relief. One approach is to gradually reduce your usage instead of going cold turkey. Set specific times during the day when you allow yourself to use it, and slowly decrease that time over a week or two. Meanwhile, try to find alternative ways to manage stress, like going for a walk, meditating, or even just taking a few deep breaths. You could also replace TikTok with apps that support your goals, like ones for studying or mindfulness. Remember, it's about creating a balance that works for you, so be patient with yourself as you make these changes. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "The key is to replace TikTok with better ways to manage stress and anxiety, rather than just trying to white-knuckle through deletion. When you're stressed about studying, your brain wants that quick dopamine hit that TikTok provides. But there are healthier alternatives that can both relax you AND keep you productive.\n\nTry this approach: Instead of completely eliminating your breaks, schedule specific 10-15 minute \"decompress\" periods between study sessions. During these breaks, do something active but relaxing - stretch, take a short walk, do some breathing exercises, or even just step outside for fresh air. These activities help reduce stress while keeping you present, unlike TikTok which just numbs you temporarily.\n\nYou might also want to try the \"delete and replace\" method. Delete TikTok, but immediately download a meditation app or podcast app instead. When you feel the urge to reach for TikTok, you'll have a healthier alternative right there on your phone. The Pomodoro technique (25 min study + 5 min break) can also help structure your study time so you don't feel overwhelmed.\n\nRemember that it's normal to feel uncomfortable at first - your brain needs time to adjust to new habits. Start with small changes, like \"no TikTok during study hours\" before going for full deletion. Each time you resist the urge to download it again, you're building stronger discipline muscles.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing how TikTok is affecting your productivity and wanting to make a change. Deleting the app is a good start, but as you've found, it's not a magic solution for dealing with stress and anxiety. One approach might be to replace TikTok with other coping mechanisms that are healthier and more productive. For example, you could try journaling, going for a short walk, or practicing deep breathing exercises when you feel stressed. This way, you're still giving yourself a break and a chance to relax, but in a way that doesn't involve mindless scrolling. Additionally, you might consider setting specific study goals and rewards for yourself, so you have something to look forward to and can stay motivated. It's also important to address the underlying stress and anxiety - are there any specific study skills or time management techniques that you're struggling with? Focusing on building those skills could help you feel more in control and confident, making it easier to stay off TikTok for good.",

Instead of deleting it outright, maybe try a few things first.\n\nOne thing that helped me was setting a timer for TikTok use. Start with, say, 30 minutes a day and gradually reduce it. When the timer goes off, force yourself to close the app, no matter what.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you're reaching for TikTok. You mentioned stress and anxiety. Can you find healthier ways to cope with those feelings? Exercise, meditation, even just talking to someone can make a difference. If you have other hobbies, try to engage in those when you feel the urge to scroll.\n\nAnother trick is to make it harder to access TikTok. Move the app icon to a less convenient spot on your phone, or even log out after each use. A little friction can go a long way.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to slip up. The important thing is to keep trying and find what works for you. Good luck!\n"

For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.\n\nWhen you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\n\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \"unhealthy\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\n\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot \"fail\" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. \n\nBtw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.\n\nI know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.\n\nF the bikini body, your happiness is more important.

Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Identify Triggers**: Since you mentioned eating out of boredom, try to pinpoint when these moments happen. Is it during a specific time of day or after certain activities? Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternative activities to distract yourself, like going for a walk, reading, or picking up a hobby.\n\n2. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to your food, savoring each bite, and eating slowly. It can help you feel more satisfied with less food.\n\n3. **Healthy Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks on hand for when cravings hit. Things like fruits, veggies, or nuts can be satisfying without adding too many calories.\n\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n\n5. **Meal Planning**: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive eating. Knowing what and when you'll eat can help you stick to your calorie goals.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. Small changes can lead to big results over time. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Eating out of boredom is super common, but there are several practical ways to get a handle on it. First, try to make eating more intentional - sit down at a table without distractions and focus on your food rather than mindlessly snacking. This helps you feel more satisfied with proper meals.\n\nFor managing cravings and leftovers specifically, portion control starts in the kitchen. Store leftovers in individual containers with proper portion sizes right after cooking. Put them toward the back of the fridge and keep cut vegetables or other low-cal snacks front and center for when you want to munch.\n\nThe boredom aspect is key here - you'll want to build a \"menu\" of alternative activities to do instead of eating. Keep your hands busy with a hobby like drawing or crafts, go for a walk, call a friend, or tackle a small task you've been putting off. The urge to eat often passes after 10-15 minutes of doing something else.\n\nDrinking water or herbal tea can also help curb false hunger. Try keeping a large water bottle with you and setting specific meal/snack times. This creates structure and makes it easier to stick to your calorie goals.\n\nRemember that building new habits takes time. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself as you develop a healthier relationship with food. You've already taken a great first step by recognizing the pattern and seeking solutions.",

One strategy that might help is to find alternative activities to do when you feel the urge to snack.

Sometimes, our brains can mistake boredom for hunger, so giving yourself something else to focus on can help curb unnecessary eating. \n\nAnother approach is to plan out your meals and snacks in advance, including healthy options that fit within your calorie goals. This can help reduce the temptation of leftovers or other high-calorie foods. You might also consider removing or limiting triggers - like keeping leftovers out of sight or finding healthier ways to cope with boredom, such as reading, drawing, or calling a friend.\n\nIt's also worth exploring why you're eating out of boredom. Is there something missing that food is filling? Addressing the underlying issue can make it easier to develop healthier habits.

Consistency isn't about perfection; it's about showing up more often than not. If you miss a day, don't beat yourself up. Just get back on track the next day. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "Today I spoke to my mom about my dreams of going overseas to work and experience the culture.\n\nMy mom just went 'what makes you think its so easy'\n\nLike, I know it's not easy, but can she just let me dream? I've never had such a big want before. The last time was in high school, and it's the same shit I got from my mom 'what makes you think you can be come a club president?' I never became the president, but I became the vice, and the president gave me full authority to handle training, events and competition while she spoke to the teachers, coaches etc.\n\nSeriously. 'You can do sponsorship?' 'are you really that good a pianist?' \n\nI get it tho, that she's tired. I've not completed my degree yet at 27, and it's honestly difficult cuz I hate what I'm studying and I regret making the 'practical' choice. Also I've been working and have an online business while doing all this.\n\nI just answered: what's wrong with dreaming big?, Look, if I want to do it, then I'll give it a go. At least I've tried even if I don't make it.' while I really wanted to say 'If you don't want to help, shut it.'\n\nI realise now that this whole time, I've been waiting for her validation. I shouldn't be waiting, and I should head out and leave people with her kind of attitude behind. Got called an idiot for not knowing to cook when they wouldn't even alow me into the kitchen. 'We give you freedom' but that never actually happened. I had enough. I'm not waiting for their validation, praise, approval anymore. \n\nMy school experience was the same: I trained my sopranos while my coach worked on the altos, she called me rude. I was the Head of stage managent for a uni event. There were boxes of sponsored items backstage, and no one informed us. I called the sponsorship team but no one picked up, so I moved the sponsored items out cuz we needed the space. As a result, some of the items got stolen. I got called stupid, and I gave them hell. \n\nIt makes me standoff-ish, but I'm slowly realising I don't have a choice. (advice needed, DO I have a choice?). Standoff-is should have been my default mode. I need to learn to act without their validation.\n\nAs my friend said: people who aks you 'what makes u think u can do X' don't know what it takes to be great.\n\nAdvice on how to move forward?\n- My habits are in sort of in place, working on it but it's slowly getting better.\n- still dunno what I want to do, but I'm exploring slowly. Literally, I've asked God, bazi and tarot cards too. \n- how do u all deal with comments like my mom's?",

Maybe she's seen you lose interest or bite off more than you could chew one too many times.. We don't know. All the character analysis you got on her above are just assumptions and projections.\n\nYour question was what to do about the comments and my answer is 'nothing'. \nYou're an adult. \nYou should set goals on your own, go after them on your own, earn them on your own. If people cheer you on or doubt you shouldn't matter.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "> What makes you think you can do X?\n\nIt's that I don't think I can't.  That's the difference between us.",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of external doubt, but it's great that you're recognizing the need to move forward without waiting for validation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your overseas dream. Break it down into smaller, actionable steps. This will help you focus on what you can control and make the dream feel more attainable.\n\n2. **Build a Support Network**: Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your dreams. This could be friends, mentors, or online communities. Having a positive support system can make a huge difference.\n\n3. **Practice Self-Validation**: Start acknowledging your own achievements and progress. Celebrate small wins and remind yourself of your capabilities. This can help reduce the need for external validation.\n\n4. **Respond with Confidence**: When faced with skepticism, respond calmly and confidently. You can say something like, \"I understand it's challenging, but I'm committed to giving it my best shot.\"\n\n5. **Learn from Criticism**: While some comments can be discouraging, try to extract any constructive feedback that might help you improve. If there's nothing useful, let it go.\n\nRemember, it's your journey, and you're allowed to dream big. Keep exploring and refining your path, and don't let doubt hold you back. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Your friend is absolutely right - people who question \"what makes you think you can do X\" often speak from their own limitations and fears. The fact that you've already succeeded as a vice president, managed events, and run an online business while studying shows you're capable of achieving what you set your mind to.\n\nHere's what's worked for many people dealing with unsupportive comments: First, recognize that seeking validation is natural, but make it a conscious practice to act independently of others' approval. When someone questions your abilities, respond with \"I'll figure it out\" or \"We'll see\" and keep moving forward. These responses acknowledge the challenge while maintaining your autonomy.\n\nFor your overseas work dreams specifically - start taking concrete steps. Research visa requirements, connect with people who've done it, maybe start learning the language. Each small step builds momentum and proves to yourself (not others) that you're serious about this path.\n\nThe standoffishness you're feeling isn't necessarily bad - it's your independence asserting itself. But instead of becoming defensive, channel that energy into quiet determination. Let your actions speak louder than any response you could give to doubters.\n\nRemember: Every person who's achieved something meaningful faced doubters along the way. The key difference is they kept going anyway. You've already shown you can succeed despite skepticism - your track record proves it. Keep building those habits, keep exploring your interests, and keep moving forward. The best response to \"what makes you think you can do X\" is simply doing X.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're at a crossroads where you're trying to break free from seeking validation from others, especially your mom, and forge your own path. That takes a lot of courage, so kudos to you for recognizing the pattern and wanting to make a change.\n\nWhen dealing with comments like \"what makes you think you can do X,\" it's essential to remember that they often stem from the other person's fears, doubts, or limitations. Your friend's quote is spot on - people who ask those questions might not understand what it takes to achieve greatness. Instead of taking their comments personally, try to see them as a reflection of their own mindset.\n\nYour response to your mom, \"what's wrong with dreaming big?\" is a great start. It shows that you're not willing to let her doubts bring you down. To take it further, you could practice asserting yourself calmly and confidently, without feeling the need to justify or explain your goals. A simple \"I'm excited about this opportunity, and I'm going to give it a shot\" can go a long way in setting boundaries.\n\nIt's also important to surround yourself with people who support and encourage you. Having a network of positive influences can help counterbalance the negative comments and make it easier for you to stay focused on your goals.\n\nAs for being \"standoff-ish,\" it's not necessarily a bad thing to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries. In fact, it's a sign of self-awareness and self-respect. You don't have to choose between being standoff-ish and seeking validation; instead, focus on developing a sense of self-trust and self-compassion. That way, you'll be more resilient to negative comments and better equipped to make decisions that align with your values and goals.\n\nKeep working on your habits, exploring your interests, and seeking guidance from various sources (including God, bazi, and tarot cards - whatever works for you!). Remember that it's okay to take your time figuring things out, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks. You're on the right path, and with persistence and self-awareness, you'll get closer to achieving your dreams.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but also like you're on the cusp of some real breakthroughs. It's tough when the people closest to you aren't supportive, especially when you're trying to figure things out.\n\nFirst, about your mom's comments: It's classic negativity bias. Some people just default to pointing out potential problems. You're right, you don't need her validation. Her comments are more about her own fears and limitations than about you. The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge her point (internally, you don't have to say it out loud), and then just keep doing your thing. Think of it as background noise. You can't control what she says, but you *can* control how you react.\n\nAs for being \"standoff-ish,\" it sounds like you're setting boundaries, which is healthy. You don't *have* to be standoffish, but you *do* have a right to protect your energy and dreams. Maybe try reframing it as being selective about who you share your goals with. Not everyone deserves to hear them.\n\nMoving forward, keep exploring! You're already doing the right things by trying different avenues to figure out what you want. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have all the answers right now. It's a journey, not a destination.\n\nRegarding habits, small consistent steps are key. Celebrate the small wins, and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. It's all part of the process.\n\nAnd finally, remember your friend's words: \"people who ask you 'what makes u think u can do X' don't know what it takes to be great.\" Believe in yourself, even when others don't. You've got this.\n"

Getting a professional resume reviewer and person to cater you to the right job with realistic expectations can help as well. You can find one for less than $150. It’s worth it. As they write your resume with your notes or update your old one.\n\nExercise especially running at the gym on a treadmill can be a keystone habit towards weightlifting. They are basically both attacking your paralysis through body chemistry and giving you mindfulness. Along with nutrition, sleep routine. \n\nIf you’re on low income find a therapist to talk things out and map your actions.\n\nDeep focus is something that needs to a lot of work as well.

Crippling mental health issues that are getting the better of me and preventing me from moving forward in my life all while being worried about time running away from me, which it is and fast. I can't give you any proper meaningful advice because if it was good advice I wouldn't be in this situation. \n\nOne day at a time.

Something else I've been doing to fight my anxiety is go into the city or town whatever it is you have where you live and force yourself to talk to people. Anyone at all. \n\nAs for motivational videos on YouTube, they won't really help too much. They are just videos made by people trying to capitalise on your rut for the most part. The only person that can help you fully achieve your goals is yourself. And you can do that, it just takes willpower.

First off, remember that it's okay to feel anxious and overwhelmed—many people do when facing big changes. To start tackling this, try breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. For example, set a goal to work on your resume for just 15 minutes a day. Once you get started, it often becomes easier to keep going. \n\nAlso, consider setting specific times for job searching or skill learning, and stick to them like appointments. This can help create a routine and reduce the feeling of being stuck. You might also want to limit your time on YouTube and your phone, as they can be distractions. Instead, use that time to take small actions towards your goals. \n\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family for support or even to review your resume. Sometimes, a little encouragement from others can make a big difference. You've got this!",

Let's break this down into smaller, manageable steps instead of trying to tackle everything at once.\n\nStart with just 15 minutes today. That's all. Pick ONE small task, like creating a basic resume draft. Don't worry about making it perfect - just get the main points down: your education, any work experience, and skills you have. There are plenty of free resume templates on Google Docs that can give you a structure to follow.\n\nFor the job search itself, start with just one website - Indeed is pretty straightforward. Search for entry-level positions in fields that interest you. Save 3-5 job posts that catch your eye, even if you don't feel qualified yet. This will help you understand what skills employers are looking for.\n\nThe key is to stop watching motivation videos and start taking tiny actions. Motivation follows action, not the other way around. Each small step builds momentum. Maybe tomorrow you spend 15 minutes customizing your resume for one of those saved jobs. The next day, you actually submit it.\n\nRemember that everyone feels anxious about job hunting - it's not just you. The difference is taking action despite the anxiety, not waiting for the anxiety to go away first.\n\nWant to start right now? Close YouTube, set a timer for 15 minutes, and work on that resume draft. Then come back and let us know how it went.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed by your anxiety and fears. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the patterns that are holding you back - that's a huge step. Now, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, why not start with tiny, manageable tasks? For example, commit to spending just 10-15 minutes a day on job searching or skill-building activities. This could be as simple as updating your resume, researching job titles, or browsing online courses. The goal is to build momentum and confidence, not to feel overwhelmed. Additionally, consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller, actionable steps. For instance, if creating a well-structured resume feels daunting, start by just making a list of your skills, experience, and education. Then, gradually add more details and refine it over time. Remember, progress over perfection is key. It might also be helpful to set specific, achievable goals for yourself, like applying to a certain number of jobs per week or dedicating a few hours on the weekend to learning a new skill. Having a clear plan can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more in control. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about \"wasting time\" - it's okay to take breaks and do things that bring you comfort. Just try to find a balance between relaxation and productivity.

Seriously tiny. Like, today, instead of \"researching courses,\" just find *one* course that looks remotely interesting and bookmark the page. That's it. Tomorrow, maybe spend 5 minutes reading the course description.\n\nFor the job search, same thing. Don't worry about the perfect resume. Just pick *one* resume template online and copy/paste your existing info into it. Doesn't have to be perfect, just a starting point. Then, pick *one* job site (Indeed, LinkedIn, whatever) and search for *one* job title.\n\nThe key is to make the initial steps so small that they're almost impossible to fail at.

      "title": "[Need Advice] The cure for hypersomnia.",
      "body": "I have the opposite problem of most modern adults. I don't struggle with sleep. Quite the opposite - I struggle with hypersomnia. Basically given the option I will seek out sleep and desire it pretty much all the time. It's unique from simply being \"tired\". I've had days where for one reason or another I didn't get good sleep and I can differentiate between \"I did not get quality sleep\" and \"I have gotten plenty of sleep but still feel sleepy\". \n\nThus far all medical explanations have fallen flat. Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. Frankly I think it's mostly behavioral that stems from past depression (when I slept a lot simply for lack of desire to do anything else). That depression has waned but the sleep issue persists. It interferes with work (I can near automatically shut off alarms even when I add obstacles, I can fall into a nap after laying down only a minute or two, and so I tend to overslept and miss even things I want to do). \n\nThings I've tried: I try covering my bed with stuffed animals during the day as a deterent but they're easy to toss aside. I try keeping myself generally bust during the day though this isn't always practical (and doesn't help in the morning when the battle is hardest). Anything I would use to stay awake when I reach the point where my brain says \"sleep\" I will just remove them to get the sleep. Even if I know I will feel worse afterward (for those who don't know if you get too much REM you can become essentially \"sleep drunk\" and it's not enjoyable or helpful).",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": ">Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's not narcolepsy. Have you seen an actual sleep specialist?",
        "percentile_10_comment": "It sounds like you need a sleep study, both a PSG and MSLT. I have narcolepsy and it basically means your brain doesn’t regulate your sleep-wake cycle appropriately. Narcolepsy can also just mean that you feel sleepy almost all the time (this is more or less how it is for me) or may even have sleep attacks (the unmistakable feeling that you just have to take a nap right now) or it can be some of both. The image of a person just suddenly collapsing into sleep is due to severe cataplexy which is a defining feature of narcolepsy type 1, and what the brain is doing is slipping into REM as a result of an emotional response. That person is also simultaneously conscious and awake. When you go into REM your muscles kind of weaken and paralyze so you don’t act out your dreams, and that’s what’s happening with cataplexy. It can also be very mild where one might feel their legs weaken or knees buckle when laughing or when someone get frustrated and they drop whatever is in their hand because they lose muscle grip. Narcolepsy type 2 generally looks like being excruciatingly sleepy all day. I have type 1, my sister has type 2. We’re both really damn sleepy but also sleepy in slightly different ways. Narcolepsy can come with it’s own insomnia feature of feeling most awake at night. But that’s just part of the sleep-wake cycle dysregulation. People with narcolepsy are also likely to have too much REM sleep and skip the deep sleep stage. And you don’t need all the symptoms, you could literally just be sleepy all the time and be diagnosed with it. Then there is also narcolepsy’s cousin idiopathic hypersomnia which is basically “We don’t know why, but you’re just pathologically sleepy”. It can look a lot like narcolepsy and narcolepsy can look a lot like it. Depression is common for both. Both disorders can be diagnosed and medicated.\n\nI chose to not take meds because I get a lot of side effects from stimulants, so I manage with lifestyle choices. The biggest one for me is diet. Too many carbs and sugar and I’ll be a sleepy zombie. Too much pizza for dinner will result in being completely unproductive the following day. Caffeine too late into the afternoon, after 3pm will diminish my quality of sleep that night. I’ll sleep but my quality of sleep is terrible. Exercising and staying active is extremely difficult and too much can put me under, but just doing light exercise will help in the long run once I’m in the habit and get over the initial sleepiness hurdles. Anything drowsy inducing is off limits, avoid meds with drowsiness as a side effect which sucks when you have allergies, although antibiotics are unavoidable, and limit alcohol or just don’t drink at all. Knowing how much to sleep has helped tremendously. I function best at between 6-7 hours, less and I feel like hell, and more than 8 and I have sleep drunkenness all day and feel a different kind of hell. You can try to experiment with any of those.\n\nBut seriously, get yourself to a doctor and request a sleep study if you need a referral. Ask for both a PSG and a MSLT. Have a two week sleep log ready to go, and you can even show up with a self-administered Epworth Sleepiness Scale results. If your score is in the 8-10 range that’s common for sleep apnea, if you’re in the 17+ range you’re in the narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia range. Feel free to drop on by the narcolepsy sub in which we support folks with IH also. I’ve heard your story dozens of times, it’s common in our community. Don’t cheat yourself out of a potentially better life.",
        "gpt_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation, but it's great that you're looking for ways to tackle it. Since you've mentioned that medical explanations haven't helped much, focusing on behavioral changes might be a good approach. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Morning Routine**: Try establishing a consistent morning routine that you enjoy and look forward to. This could be something simple like a favorite breakfast, a short walk, or listening to music. The key is to create a positive association with waking up.\n\n2. **Light Exposure**: Increase your exposure to natural light, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your circadian rhythm and signal to your body that it's time to be awake.\n\n3. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some form of physical activity into your day. Even a short walk or some stretching can boost your energy levels and reduce the urge to nap.\n\n4. **Mindful Breaks**: Instead of napping, try taking short, mindful breaks where you do something relaxing but not sleep-inducing, like deep breathing or a quick meditation.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can be a great motivator.\n\nRemember, it's about small, consistent changes rather than drastic overhauls. Be patient with yourself as you experiment with what works best for you. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Since you've ruled out medical causes, let's focus on breaking this behavioral pattern through environmental and habit changes. First, make your bed completely inaccessible during the day - not just covered with stuffed animals, but stripped of blankets and pillows. Store these in a closet or another room. This creates a much stronger barrier than items you can easily move aside.\n\nFor mornings, place your alarm across the room and pair it with immediate exposure to bright light - either natural sunlight or a smart bulb that turns on with your alarm. The key is making the transition from sleep to wake more decisive. As soon as you're up, do something physically engaging like 5 jumping jacks or walking to the kitchen for a glass of water.\n\nThroughout the day, try the \"5-minute rule\" when you feel the urge to nap. Tell yourself you'll do just 5 minutes of any activity (stretching, walking, organizing) before deciding about sleep. Often the urge passes once you're engaged in something else. Keep a log of times when you feel most sleepy and what you were doing just before - this can help identify triggers.\n\nThe most important thing is to maintain a consistent wake time, even on weekends. Your body will gradually adjust to expect wakefulness at certain times. When you do feel the need to rest, set a strict 20-minute timer for naps and only take them before 3pm.\n\nRemember that breaking this pattern will feel uncomfortable at first, but each day you resist unnecessary sleep helps rewire your brain's expectations. Start with these changes and adjust based on what works best for you.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough challenge, and it's great that you've already explored medical explanations and are considering the potential behavioral roots of your hypersomnia. Given your history with depression, it's possible that sleep has become a coping mechanism or a deeply ingrained habit for you. \n\nOne strategy you might consider is setting up a consistent wake-up routine that doesn't involve immediately getting back into bed. This could be as simple as making yourself a cup of coffee or tea, taking a short walk outside, or doing some light stretching. The goal is to create a clear distinction between sleep time and wake time, and to give yourself a sense of purpose and momentum in the morning.\n\nYou've also mentioned that you tend to oversleep and miss out on things you want to do, which suggests that there may be some underlying motivation or reward structure at play. Could you try setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day, and rewarding yourself when you meet them? This might help you build a sense of accomplishment and motivation that can compete with the desire to sleep.\n\nIt's also worth considering seeking out the help of a therapist or counselor who can work with you to address any underlying emotional or psychological issues that may be contributing to your hypersomnia. They can help you develop strategies for managing your sleep and building healthier habits, and provide support and accountability as you work to make changes.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, that sounds really tough. It's frustrating when medical explanations don't quite fit, and you're left trying to manage something that feels behavioral but is still really impactful.\n\nSince you suspect it's rooted in past depression and a learned behavior, maybe try tackling it like breaking any other habit, but with extra self-compassion. It sounds like you're already fighting hard against it.\n\nHere are a few ideas, focusing on small, incremental changes:\n\n*   **Sleep Hygiene, Revisited:** I know you've probably heard this a million times, but really drill down on the basics. Consistent sleep/wake times (even on weekends!), a truly dark/quiet/cool room, and a solid wind-down routine. The consistency is key, even if you don't feel sleepy.\n*   **Light Therapy:** Since you mentioned REM sleep issues, maybe look into a sunrise alarm clock or light therapy lamp, especially in the mornings. It can help regulate your circadian rhythm and potentially reduce that \"sleep drunk\" feeling.\n*   **Tiny Wins, Big Rewards:** Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on one small victory each day. Maybe it's just getting out of bed within 5 minutes of your alarm. Reward yourself for that *immediately* with something you genuinely enjoy (a specific coffee, a quick walk, etc.). The immediate reward is important to rewire the association.\n*   **Habit Stacking:** Link getting out of bed to something you *want* to do. \"After I turn off my alarm, I will immediately [make coffee/stretch/read one page of a book].\" Make it something appealing and easy.\n*   **Professional Help (Again?):** It might be worth revisiting therapy, specifically focusing on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), even though you don't have insomnia in the traditional sense. The techniques for managing sleep-related thoughts and behaviors might still be helpful.\n*   **Accountability:** Find someone to check in with you daily. Just a simple text message exchange: \"Did you get up on time?\" \"Yes/No.\" Knowing someone is expecting you to be up might add that extra bit of motivation.\n\nThe biggest thing is to be patient with yourself. It's a process, and there will be setbacks. Don't let a bad day derail your progress. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Good luck!\n"

As recommended earlier in this thread set small goals. If you have a goal for where you want to be, even a small step forward is okay. Try to set your goals tied to doing the process rather than what you “should” look like. When you do the latter you’re constantly living in a state of not succeeding at your goal which will add stress to an already stressful life. Learning to love the process and using the scale as a metric to refine your process rather than define yourself is a helpful headspace. Examples of where to start could look like “for the next three months I will walk for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week” or “for the next three month I will stick to a meal plan and not snack 3/7 days a week”.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. Balancing med school and personal goals is tough, but it's definitely doable with some small, consistent steps. \n\nStart by identifying specific triggers for your overeating. Is it stress, boredom, or social pressure? Once you know what sets it off, you can work on strategies to manage those moments. For stress, try incorporating short, daily activities that help you unwind, like a quick walk, meditation, or even just deep breathing exercises. \n\nWhen it comes to food, try to plan your meals and snacks ahead of time. Having a set plan can help you avoid impulsive eating. Also, keep healthier snacks on hand so when you do feel the urge to munch, you have better options available. \n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect but making small, sustainable changes. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Building discipline is a journey, and you're already on the right path by taking the first step. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I totally get the challenge of managing weight while dealing with a stressful med school environment. Instead of trying to make dramatic changes all at once, let's focus on small, sustainable adjustments you can make even within your current situation.\n\nFirst, for stress eating: Try keeping a food journal for a week, noting not just what you eat but what triggered the eating (stress, boredom, social pressure, etc.). This will help you spot patterns and plan alternatives. When you identify a trigger, have a ready replacement activity - maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or even studying in a different spot.\n\nFor portion control: Use smaller plates and bowls, and try the \"pause method\" - eat half your portion, wait 10 minutes while drinking water, then reassess if you're still hungry. When others offer leftovers, practice saying \"Thanks, but I'm good!\" It might feel awkward at first, but people usually respect a clear boundary.\n\nFor sustainable weight management: Focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting. Add an extra serving of vegetables to each meal, or start your day with protein-rich foods. These small additions can naturally crowd out less healthy choices without feeling like deprivation.\n\nRemember, you've successfully lost weight before, so you know you're capable. The key this time is building habits that work with your busy schedule, not against it. Start with one small change this week - which of these suggestions feels most doable to you right now?",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're acknowledging the role stress plays in your overeating, and that's a huge step forward. As a med student, you likely have a lot on your plate, but trying to tackle your weight loss goals without addressing the underlying stress might not be sustainable. Have you considered finding alternative ways to cope with stress, like exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend? These can help reduce your reliance on food for comfort. \n\nIn terms of eating habits, it might be helpful to start tracking what you eat and when, to identify patterns and triggers. You don't have to drastically cut back on food, but being more mindful of your portions and hunger cues could make a big difference. It's also okay to say no to others' leftovers or to eat because you can - prioritizing your own needs is important. \n\nSince you've lost weight before, you know it's possible for you. Instead of focusing on the end goal, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps, like taking a short walk each day or preparing healthier meals in advance. This can help build confidence and make the process feel less overwhelming. Remember that it's not about being perfect, but about making progress and developing habits that you can maintain in the long term.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey there, I totally get the med school struggle – it's a pressure cooker! It's awesome that you're recognizing the connection between stress and eating, that's half the battle.\n\nInstead of focusing on a huge weight loss goal right away, maybe try some smaller, more manageable changes. Since you mentioned boredom and leftovers are triggers, could you try keeping healthy snacks readily available (like cut veggies or fruit) and pre-portioning them? That way, when boredom hits, you're reaching for something that aligns with your goals.\n\nFor the leftover situation, it's okay to politely decline! You could say something like, \"Thanks, but I'm trying to be mindful of my portions right now.\" People usually understand.\n\nAlso, think about adding in some stress-reducing activities, even if it's just for 15 minutes a day. A quick walk, some stretching, or even just listening to music can make a difference. It's about finding healthy coping mechanisms instead of turning to food.\n\nDon't beat yourself up if you slip up – it happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Small, consistent changes are way more sustainable than trying to overhaul everything at once. You got this!\n"

      "title": "[Need Advice] My issues are spiraling out of control",
      "body": "I need to change, but I’m not sure how, or rather where to start.\n\nThere are a bunch of issues, some more recent than others. It just seems like they’re culminating in a way now, making the overall situation worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI procrastinate to the point of being self-destructive. For a long time, throughout school and beyond, putting things off over and over worked out perfectly fine, because with a little bit of last-minute crunch I was able to achieve most things, and the consequences for when I couldn’t were mild. In hindsight, this never forced me to develop the necessary skills and discipline for working continuously on projects, or myself in general. What little I have in that regard has been a struggle to acquire. However, it’s not even universal. I absolutely hate going to the gym, but I still do it regularly anyway. So, objectively, I can get off my ass repeatedly. I have some methods to restrain myself. But more often than not, I push of the important things over and over. Sometimes critically important things. So much so that it seems like I don’t care about myself at all. Going out of my way for other people is no problem, for me though…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have developed some agarophobia during the pandemic, and probably anxiety about confronting people, f.e. clerks for bureaucratic concerns, doctors appointments and so on. I’ve always been introverted, but not averse to people in general. Ever since the lockdowns, going out somewhere is suddenly a matter of discipline. Some instance in my brain just doesn’t want me to go anywhere, and I have to force myself through that every time, even though it’s not even particularly bad. Of course, this exacerbates the procrastination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lie, reflexively, all the time, and then commit to those lies unnecessarily. About my plans for the day, about how I’m feeling, how a particular thing is progressing, a bunch of different things, really. Upon reflection, those lies seem to aid all the things above, as well as being more comforting than the truth for people around me. As if, in the moment, lying is quicker than explaining myself thoroughly, while the truth just makes the other party concerned, but still unable to help anyway. On top of this idiocy, I then commit to those lies to appear consistent, like having said I’m going to X at a certain time, and then “having to” go somewhere, like to public library, and working on something that isn’t even urgent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI waste time, instead, with things that aren’t even important to me. When I put off a phone call and rather start cooking something elaborate and then thoroughly enjoy it with other people, it’s still not ideal, but I’m mostly fine with it. Most of the time though, a part of my brain just seem to go like “avoid X at all cost” and fills the space “until” X with anything and everything. Youtube, games, chats with people, cleaning, researching, reading, doomscrolling, walking… Anything trivial. The large majority of which I won’t even remember the day after. Concerning is, how oftentimes I don’t even register that I’m purposefully avoiding something in the moment. It’s like being on autopilot, or a drunken binge. REALLY concerning is, that even when I do realize what I’m doing (or rather not doing) I can’t reliably lift myself out of it, and start. If I do, it is incredibly taxing. If I don’t, it feels almost dissociative, like I’m bewildered how I don’t care enough about this/myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also might have dampened my emotional responses somehow. When observing other people, having similar issues, they’re kickstarted into action by strong emotions, even without discipline. Their pride, self-loathing, feeling of obligation, spite, or concern about themselves or others are a strong impetus. Like a safety line, before things get too out of hand. I do have these feelings, but I sometimes wonder why they are so soft, and incongruent with the circumstances. I know this isn’t the solution to the overall problem, said people still procrastinate after all. But it contributes to my confusion how to approach this in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m not clinically depressed. I really wish I was, that would be a comparatively easy solution. But that’s been eliminated by a psychiatrist for a while. I can’t seek psychiatric help either, though. In my country, ever since the lockdowns, those services have been utterly overwhelmed. If you’re not suffering severely, or aren’t a risk to yourself, or others, there’s simply no space at the moment. Waiting lists for appointments are 6-8 months. However, I need to do something NOW. Even more so, if I need to start with incremental change, which, unless any of you can provide a different epiphany, I obviously do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I’m turning to this corner of the internet, to see if any of you kind people have experience and input that could be helpful for me. Objectively, I’m good at assessing my situation and what needs to be done, what my needs are, how to provide for them properly, etc. What I struggle with is the application, the methods, the battle between my brain tricking me, and me tricking my brain. And figuring out where to start in this mess. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.\n\n(Also, this has bloated a lot. If you’ve read this far, that deserves a Thank you all on its own.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, kudos for reaching out and being so open about what you're dealing with. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're looking for solutions is a great first step.\n\nLet's tackle this one step at a time. Since you mentioned that you can get yourself to the gym despite not liking it, you already have some discipline muscles to flex. Try applying that same mindset to other areas. Start small—pick one task you've been avoiding and commit to working on it for just 5 minutes. Often, the hardest part is starting, and once you do, you might find it easier to keep going.\n\nFor the procrastination and avoidance, try setting up a simple reward system. After completing a task, even a small one, give yourself a little treat or break. This can help rewire your brain to associate completing tasks with positive outcomes.\n\nRegarding the lying and avoidance, it might help to practice being more honest with yourself first. When you catch yourself about to lie, pause and ask why you're doing it. Sometimes just acknowledging the truth to yourself can be a powerful step toward change.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned anxiety about going out, try to gradually expose yourself to these situations. Start with something low-stakes and build up from there. It might also help to have a friend or family member accompany you for support.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Thanks for sharing your situation so openly. The good news is that you already have some discipline (as shown by your gym habit) and strong self-awareness about your patterns. That's actually a huge advantage for making changes.\n\nLet's focus on starting small and building from there. Since you mentioned needing to do something NOW, here's what I suggest:\n\nStart with a 5-minute rule for tasks you're avoiding. When you notice yourself going into avoidance mode, commit to just 5 minutes of the important task. Often you'll find yourself continuing past those 5 minutes once you've broken through the initial resistance. If not, that's okay too - you still did something productive.\n\nFor the lying habit, try replacing it with a simple \"I'll get back to you on that\" when asked about plans or progress. This gives you space to think and respond truthfully without the pressure of an immediate answer. The key is breaking the reflexive response pattern.\n\nRegarding the agoraphobia and anxiety around appointments - start by making one important call or handling one piece of bureaucracy first thing in the morning, before your brain has time to build up resistance. Morning tends to be when our willpower is strongest.\n\nThe emotional dampening and autopilot behavior you described often comes from being overwhelmed. Try keeping a simple done list (not a to-do list) where you write down what you actually accomplished each day, even tiny things. This creates awareness of your patterns and gives you small wins to build on.\n\nRemember: you don't need to fix everything at once. Pick ONE of these suggestions to try for a week. Track how it goes. Then either adjust or add another small change. The goal isn't perfection - it's progress.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you're facing, so kudos to you for taking this first step. It's clear that you have a good understanding of your situation and what needs to change, but as you said, the application and methods are where you're getting stuck. \n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building one habit at a time. You mentioned that you're able to get yourself to the gym regularly, which is a great example of discipline in action. Could you try to apply some of the same strategies that work for you with exercise to other areas of your life? For instance, you might start by committing to a tiny, daily task related to one of your problem areas, like making a phone call or working on a project for just 10 minutes a day.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention lying as a way to avoid discomfort or explanation. This might be worth exploring further, as it could be related to some deeper issues with self-compassion or fear of judgment. Practicing honesty with yourself and others, even in small ways, could help build trust and reduce the need for avoidance behaviors.\n\nLastly, since you can't seek psychiatric help right now, you might look into online resources like therapy apps, podcasts, or YouTube channels focused on productivity, anxiety, and personal development. These can provide some guidance and support while you're waiting for more formal help.\n\nRemember that developing discipline and changing habits takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You don't have to tackle everything at once, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. What do you think might be the smallest, most manageable change you could make this week to get started?",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I read your whole post. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're self-aware enough to analyze all this is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much – you're clearly capable of change, as you mentioned with the gym.\n\nSince you're feeling overwhelmed, let's focus on one small win to start. Forget the big picture for now. Pick *one* thing you've been procrastinating on – something small, like making a single phone call or sending one email. Commit to doing *just that one thing* tomorrow morning. Don't think about anything else on your to-do list. Just that one task.\n\nTo combat the autopilot avoidance, try this: set an alarm on your phone for a specific time tomorrow morning (say, 9:00 AM). When it goes off, immediately do that one task. No excuses, no \"just five more minutes\" – just do it. The key is to break the cycle of avoidance *before* it starts.\n\nRegarding the lying, maybe try a little experiment. For one day, just focus on telling the truth, even if it's uncomfortable. You don't have to over-explain, just be honest about what you're doing and how you're feeling. See how it goes. It might feel weird at first, but it could also be liberating.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix everything overnight. It's about making small, consistent changes over time. Celebrate those small wins, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. You got this.\n"

      "title": "[Need Advice] How can I get disciplined when I don't care about my goals?",
      "body": "Repost because I forgot flair, sorry\n\nI understand that motivation is fleeting. I understand one needs to use discipline instead, to do it even if they don't feel like it.\n\nThe problem is, I don't even get fleeting motivation. I understand motivation is not helpful for actually completing tasks, but I get the sense that it's somewhat necessary for original goal setting. I can't set meaningful goals at all.\n\nThere's nothing I really want. Sure, every once in a while I think something might be nice, but then I think a little harder about what actually would happen, and realize that I actually am not interested in it at all. For example, I might randomly think \"hey wouldn't it be cool to play the piano\" but I have no real desire or emotion attached to it, and once I picture myself having learned to play the piano, I wouldn't want to play anyway, I wouldn't care that I could play, I just wouldn't really get anything out of it at all. That's not even counting all the effort in hypothetically learning how to play. I can't think of any goal that would really have any long term positive benefit that would outweigh the upfront pain and discipline.\n\nThis makes goal setting seem like an exercise in futility. Every single idea I come up with seems as random and pointless as if I randomly strung together a sentence. Getting better at math or reading a book or whatever, when I truly don't care about it and don't see any way I could apply the skills to get any benefit, looks exactly the same to me as \"My goal will be... 'Balance'... 'Shoe'... 'Under'... 'Knee'\". My response is always immediate bewilderment and a resounding *why?!*\n\nI swear, I don't need a huge why. I regularly push through pain at work because an employee gets the job done until they decide to formally quit. I respond to emails and texts promptly no matter how anxious or busy or whatever I am because it shows respect. I do fine with health-related goals, because I can see the benefits of having more strength and energy, and ultimately staying healthy and independent for longer.\n\nThe problem is with self-improvement or overall living a more disciplined life, things I know I \"should\" do but can't really find any reason why. I'm just not a very disciplined person. I know discipline > motivation. But I just don't understand what the point of, for example, developing a hobby is, if all it really is doing something you hate just so you can get better at something you hate just for what, masochism brownie points?\n\nThis lack of discipline is starting to become even more problematic. I'm at an age where I need to apply to colleges and decide what I'm going to do, and I just can't bring myself to study and apply anymore. I've never had problems in school in the past, but I just can't see any benefits of going to college vs going to trade school. I have no interests, as long as I make enough to eat it's all the same to me. So it's not that I don't want to work on applications, it's that I don't want the applications to be done. I don't want to get good grades. It's suddenly very hard to muster up discipline to work towards things I don't actually want to happen.\n\nI've tried just pushing through and following random goals for the discipline. I always heard that motivation will eventually follow action. This never happens. I start off trying to ignore my misgivings and just do it, over time (like for months, I am giving it a bit of a chance) I come to hate it more and more, and eventually the stress of trying to continue force myself starts carrying over into other areas of my life, until finally I admit that I hate it and I'm not going to get any foreseeable benefits and it's only getting worse. I give in and show that I don't have discipline after all. This hits especially hard with hobbies, because they require so much discipline, and there's no real reason for them other than personal fulfillment and enjoyment, which I never feel no matter how long I force myself or how good I get.\n\nThen I hear on here that it never ends. You always have to use discipline. It's always a struggle. I just don't understand why I should try to be disciplined, if I'll always only struggle and never get any benefit.\n\nPeople always say that the pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret, but what do you do when you genuinely just don't feel regret? Admittedly I'm young, but I've never regretted missing out on opportunities or not doing enough. I've only ever regretted working so hard at things that didn't matter, I wish I could've rested and relaxed more, and I wish I wouldn't have ruined the few interests I had trying to turn them into hobbies. I've always been more laid-back and don't really dwell on potential life paths anyway. Nothing is really important to me except my health which I already work to maintain, nothing really interests me enough to outweigh the pain of discipline.\n\nWith this attitude, it's very difficult to see why I should even bother. I know that ultimately I'm just whining, but I was just wondering if anyone knew what could help with this, or at least if anyone else is in the same boat? Is there anything I'm just not thinking of? Is it really just an unrealistic expectation to have a reason or a bit of motivation while setting goals? If they won't be meaningful anyway, what goals do I set, how do I even know I'm setting the right ones? Or am I just making a lot of excuses and I just need a swift kick in the pants lol\n\nBasically, how to find the motivation to use discipline in the first place?",

One approach you might consider is focusing on small, low-pressure experiments rather than setting big goals. Instead of committing to a hobby or a path, try exploring different activities with a mindset of curiosity rather than obligation. For example, you could try a new activity for just 10 minutes a day or once a week, without any expectation of sticking with it long-term. This way, you might stumble upon something that naturally piques your interest without the pressure of turning it into a goal.\n\nAlso, consider reframing discipline as a tool for self-discovery rather than self-improvement. It's not just about achieving something but about learning more about what you enjoy or value. Sometimes, the act of doing can lead to unexpected insights about what matters to you. Lastly, it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Life is a series of experiments, and it's perfectly fine to take your time finding what resonates with you.",
        "claude_comment": "Your post really resonates because it highlights a common catch-22: it's hard to build discipline without having meaningful goals, but it's hard to find meaningful goals without some initial spark of interest or motivation.\n\nHere's what I suggest: instead of trying to manufacture interest in random hobbies or forcing yourself to set arbitrary goals, start by examining what already drives your existing behaviors. You mentioned you consistently handle work responsibilities, maintain your health, and respond promptly to communications. These aren't random - they align with your values of reliability, independence, and respect for others.\n\nTry building on these existing foundations. Rather than asking \"what hobby should I force myself to do?\", ask \"what would help me become even more reliable/independent/respectful?\" This shifts the focus from trying to generate artificial interests to expanding on values you already demonstrate.\n\nFor the college situation - instead of trying to manufacture passion for a specific field, approach it through the lens of expanding your capacity for independence and reliability. What path would give you the most options and flexibility? What skills would make you a more capable person overall?\n\nThe goal isn't to suddenly become passionate about everything. It's about recognizing that discipline can serve your existing values, even if you don't feel motivated about specific activities. Start small - pick one area where being more disciplined would directly support something you already care about, even if the individual tasks themselves don't excite you.\n\nRemember that not everyone needs to be passionate about their work or have intense hobbies. There's nothing wrong with being laid-back. The key is building discipline in service of the few things you do genuinely value, rather than trying to force yourself to care about things that truly don't matter to you.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're struggling to find meaning or purpose in setting goals, which is making it hard for you to develop discipline. One thing that might help is to focus on the process rather than the end result. Instead of thinking about what you want to achieve, think about what kind of person you want to be or how you want to show up in your daily life. For example, do you want to be someone who is reliable and responsible? Do you want to be able to tackle challenges head-on? \n\nYou mentioned that you're able to push through pain at work and respond to emails promptly because it shows respect, which suggests that you value being a respectful and responsible person. Maybe you can use those values as a starting point for developing discipline in other areas of your life. It's not about finding a specific goal that motivates you, but about cultivating habits and behaviors that align with your values.\n\nIt might also be helpful to start small and focus on building discipline in tiny ways, like creating a daily routine or setting aside a few minutes each day for self-reflection. These small wins can add up over time and help you build confidence in your ability to follow through on commitments. \n\nAs for finding motivation, it's possible that you're looking at it the wrong way. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try to focus on building curiosity. What are you interested in learning more about? What problems do you want to solve? Even if you don't feel passionate about something, you might be curious about it, and that can be enough to get you started.\n\nLastly, it's worth considering that discipline is not just about achieving specific goals, but also about developing a sense of self-awareness and self-regulation. By cultivating discipline, you're not just working towards external outcomes, but also building your internal capacity to navigate life's challenges. That in itself can be a powerful motivator, even if you don't have a specific goal in mind.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're in a bit of a motivational rut, and forcing yourself into things just makes it worse. The whole \"discipline for discipline's sake\" thing can feel pretty pointless when you don't see the point.\n\nMaybe the problem isn't a lack of discipline, but a lack of direction. You're trying to apply discipline to goals that don't resonate, and that's a recipe for burnout. Instead of focusing on grand self-improvement projects, try experimenting with small, low-stakes things. Think of it as gathering data, not committing to a lifestyle.\n\nFor example, instead of \"learn piano,\" try \"spend 15 minutes exploring a free online piano lesson.\" No pressure to become a concert pianist, just a tiny experiment to see if anything sparks your interest. If it doesn't, no big deal, move on to something else. The key is to remove the pressure of long-term commitment and focus on the immediate experience.\n\nAs for college vs. trade school, maybe talk to people in both fields. Shadow someone for a day. See what their actual day-to-day looks like. Don't just think about the end result, but the process itself. Which path seems more tolerable, or even mildly interesting?\n\nAlso, it's okay not to have a burning passion right now. A lot of people don't. Focus on building a life that's sustainable and allows you to explore different options. Maybe that means finding a job that pays the bills and leaves you with enough free time to try new things without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFinally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore your values and identify what truly matters to you, without the pressure of having to \"fix\" yourself. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Don't beat yourself up for not being \"disciplined\" enough. Focus on finding something that makes you want to be.\n"

        "claude_comment": "The longer summer days definitely mess with our circadian rhythms! Your previous routine sounds solid, but you might need to adjust a few things to get back on track. Since you're already avoiding late meals and alcohol while staying active, let's focus on your wind-down routine.\n\nTry gradually dimming lights in your home starting around 7:30-8pm. Your body needs that darkness signal, especially when it's still bright outside. Blackout curtains can also help create an artificial sunset in your bedroom.\n\nWhat time are you actually going to bed? With a 5am wake time, you'll want to be asleep by 9:30pm latest to get enough rest. You might need to temporarily shift your bedtime 15-30 minutes earlier until your body readjusts.\n\nOne trick that works well is setting a \"sunset alarm\" - when it goes off, start your evening routine regardless of how light it is outside. Your body will eventually catch on.\n\nKeep your morning wake-up time consistent (even on weekends) and get some early morning sunlight when you first get up. This helps reset your internal clock. Give these adjustments about two weeks to really stick. You've done this successfully before, so it's just a matter of recalibrating to the seasonal change.",
        "llama_comment": "It's not uncommon for our routines to get disrupted by seasonal changes, so don't be too hard on yourself. The longer days can definitely affect our sleep patterns and motivation. Considering you've been consistent with your exercise routine and have healthy habits like avoiding late-night eating and alcohol, it's likely just a matter of adjusting to the new daylight schedule. Have you tried keeping your wake-up time consistent on weekends as well? Sometimes, allowing ourselves to sleep in on weekends can make it harder to get back into the early riser routine during the week. You might also want to try setting a consistent bedtime schedule and creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down, regardless of the sun still being up. Lastly, remind yourself why waking up at 5am was important to you in the first place - what were you using that time for, and how did it make you feel? Refocusing on those benefits might help you regain your motivation to get back on track.",

Since you've already built the habit, that's a huge plus – it's way easier to restart than to start from scratch.\n\nA few thoughts: First, the longer days are definitely a factor. Our bodies are sensitive to light. Maybe try blackout curtains if you don't already have them? Even a small amount of light can mess with your sleep.\n\nSecond, re-evaluate your bedtime. If the sun's setting later is throwing you off, you might need to adjust when you're hitting the hay to still get those solid hours of sleep. Experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier for a few nights and see if that helps.\n\nThird, consider a gradual reset. Instead of jumping straight back to 5 am, try waking up at 5:30 am for a few days, then 6 am, and slowly work your way back. This can be less jarring on your system.\n\nFinally, remember why you enjoyed those early mornings in the first place. Reconnecting with that motivation can give you the extra push you need.

Here are a few thoughts that might help you find some direction:\n\n1. **Start Small**: If you're interested in design but unsure about school, try taking a few online courses or workshops. This can help you gauge your interest and build some foundational skills without a huge commitment.\n\n2. **Explore Your Passions**: Since you love animals, maybe look into volunteering at a shelter or working part-time at a pet store. This could give you a sense of fulfillment and help you decide if you want to pursue something more in that field.\n\n3. **Balance and Prioritize**: If you decide to go back to school, consider part-time classes. Many people work and study simultaneously, but it's important to find a balance that works for you. Prioritize what's most important to you right now, whether it's education, work, or relationships.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Overthinking can be paralyzing, so try setting small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning something new or setting aside time each week to explore different interests.\n\n5. **Stay Open and Flexible**: Life is a journey, and it's okay to change paths. What matters is that you're moving forward and learning along the way.\n\nRemember, it's perfectly fine to take your time figuring things out.

        "claude_comment": "Hey there! At 25, it's totally normal to feel uncertain about your path - many of us have been there. Instead of trying to figure out your entire life right now, let's break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nFirst, you don't need to commit to a massive career change immediately. Start by exploring your interests in design and working with animals in small ways. You could volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends or take some free online design courses (like on Coursera or YouTube) to test the waters without a huge commitment.\n\nAbout school - yes, many people work full-time while studying. It's challenging but doable, especially if you start part-time with just 1-2 classes. Community colleges are great for this because they're more affordable and offer flexible schedules. You can always transfer credits later if you decide to pursue a full degree.\n\nThe key is to start small and build discipline gradually. Pick ONE thing - maybe a single evening class or a weekend volunteer position - and commit to it for 3 months. Use that experience to learn about yourself and what you actually enjoy doing (not just what you think you might enjoy).\n\nRemember that your first step doesn't have to be your forever step.

One thing that might help is to break down your interests into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Similarly, if you're interested in design, you could try taking online courses or attending workshops to see if it's something you enjoy and are good at before deciding whether to pursue further education.\n\nAs for going back to school, it's definitely possible to balance it with work and other responsibilities, but it does require some discipline and time management. You might consider starting with a part-time or online program to see how it fits into your schedule. It's also worth looking into programs that offer flexible scheduling or support for working students.\n\nIt's great that you've been working on prioritizing yourself and learning to love yourself - that's a huge accomplishment, and it will serve you well as you navigate this next phase of your life.

        "percentile_10_comment": "I found NoFap about 7 years ago now. Prior to it, all my roommates openly talked about porn, how many tabs they had open on their browser at night, etc. Like most early 20's males, porn was just considered normal.\n\nI do think refraining from excessive masturbation or even masturbation at all is a good thing. Ideally you want a partner to be enjoying that shit with, but that's not an option for many in certain times of their life and that's ok too. The main issue I see with porn/masturbation for guys is they use it as a crutch. If you can just go fap to some hot internet girl, why go to the gym? Why strive for a better job? Why go out and meet real girls? Why try different things with your girlfriend or wife? All that requires effort, putting yourself out there, etc.\n\nIf you're doing it every night, multiple times a day, or using it as 'escapism' for stress or your problems when things get tough, that's when it can be an issue. However on the flip side, the NoFap community makes it out to be completely evil and like you should never fap, ever. It's very very very hard to just never do it ever again. The goal to them is to go on these 100, 200, 300+ day streaks and count days... which ultimately isn't sustainable. And when you do fail, it's very easy to really beat yourself up over it.\n\nThe better thing to focus on is \"not watching porn\" rather than \"stopping masturbation\". You don't want to be addicted to overstimulated porn images, which many times makes real sex boring and guys can't get hard. \n\nPer Chinese medicine there are rules for how many nuts you should be busting per every few days. I believe for someone in their 20's it's about every 3-4 days... any more and they believed you were basically \"wasting your lifeforce\". IMO, this really just means you're too focused on sex and should be focusing on other things in life.\n\nIMO, reset your goals. Striving for 30 days or something to start is good. Make absolutely sure you know WHY you're doing this. If there's no WHY, when you're stressed, it's before bed, etc. you'll just rationalize it's ok and do it - this is why everyone fails.\n\nRealize you're probably going to fail. Right now you'll swear up and down you won't, but 10 days in, 20 days in.... you'll give in or at least want to. That's when it really starts.\n\nDelete any saved porn you have. Use a porn blocker to block websites as another means to stop yourself - it might not totally stop you as you can turn it off, but at least it's another step. Don't take devices into your room at night.\n\nBiggest tip: Go do other shit. Get a main hobby. Dive more into your current hobbies. Lift. Run. You're going to have to focus on and do other things.\n\nAnd good luck.",

        "claude_comment": "Sexual urges are completely natural and nothing to feel ashamed about. The key isn't to eliminate these feelings (which isn't possible or healthy), but rather to channel that energy productively.\n\nFirst, consider reducing triggers - limiting social media use and being mindful of what content you consume can help reduce the frequency and intensity of urges. But beyond that, the best approach is to stay actively engaged in other pursuits when these feelings arise.\n\nExercise is particularly effective - when you feel those urges coming on, try going for a run, doing pushups, or hitting the gym. Physical activity naturally redirects that energy while releasing endorphins. Plus, regular exercise helps regulate hormones and reduce stress.\n\nOther helpful strategies include:\n- Getting outside and changing your environment\n- Diving into an engaging hobby or project\n- Meditation and breathing exercises\n- Cold showers (seriously, they work)\n- Staying social and around other people\n\nRemember that this isn't about suppression - it's about having a toolkit of healthy alternatives to redirect that energy. Keep building positive habits and stay focused on your goals. The urges won't disappear completely, but they'll become easier to manage as you develop these alternative outlets.\n\nYou're already showing great discipline with your current streak.

Exercise can help reduce tension and shift your mind away from sexual thoughts. Additionally, engaging in hobbies or creative pursuits can serve as a distraction and outlet for your energy.\n\nIt's also important to be mindful of your social media use and the content you consume. If certain types of posts or accounts trigger these urges, it might be wise to limit your exposure or take breaks from those platforms.\n\nDeveloping a consistent daily routine that includes time for self-care, productivity, and relaxation can help regulate your thoughts and feelings. Ensure you're getting enough sleep, as lack of rest can increase susceptibility to impulsive behaviors.\n\nRemember, overcoming sexual urges is not about suppressing them entirely but about learning to manage them in a way that aligns with your personal values and goals. It might be helpful to explore resources or support groups focused on sexual health and self-control for additional guidance and community support.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to experience setbacks, and it doesn't mean you've failed.

WHAT DO I DO?!\n\nYou might be wondering how this happened...well...\n\nI have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \"content\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.\n\nAnother problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.\n\nEven when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\n\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say \"I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say \"just do it\", but it doesn't work like that.\n\nFor stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination.

It might be tough, but consider having a candid conversation with your dad and the scholarship committee. Explain that you struggled with the transition and are actively working on improving. They might appreciate your honesty and determination to do better.\n\nRegarding your habits, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. Since blockers haven't worked, try changing your environment. If possible, study in a library or a café where distractions are minimized. Also, set small, achievable goals for each day. Instead of thinking about the entire semester, focus on completing one assignment or studying for one hour. Celebrate these small wins to build momentum.\n\nFor the social anxiety, consider reaching out to your college's counseling services. They can offer support and strategies to manage anxiety, which might help you feel more comfortable tackling these conversations and responsibilities.\n\nLastly, about skipping the semester, weigh the pros and cons. If you think taking a break will help you reset and come back stronger, it might be worth considering. But if you feel you can manage with some adjustments, maybe try to push through with a lighter course load.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to ask for help along the way.

Explain that you struggled with the transition to college and managing your time, but you have a concrete plan to improve (which we'll get to). Most scholarship programs have academic probation periods rather than immediate cancellation.\n\nFor the addiction and procrastination - your brain is stuck in a dopamine loop. Those quick hits from games and adult content are way more appealing than delayed rewards from studying. The kitchen wandering is your brain seeking novelty when deprived of its usual stimulation.\n\nHere's what you do:\nStart ridiculously small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE class next semester and commit to attending every single lecture, sitting in the front row. Just showing up consistently will begin rewiring your reward pathways.\n\nGet out of your room to study. Go to the library or a coffee shop where you can't access explicit content. The environment change helps break patterns.\n\nSet a timer for just 25 minutes of focused work. When urges hit, tell yourself you only have to wait until the timer ends. Often you'll find you want to continue once you start.\n\nReplace the gaming/adult content with something physical - pushups, walking, anything. You need an alternative outlet for that restless energy.\n\nMost importantly - forgive yourself but don't give up. You're 18 and figuring things out. Many students struggle their first semester. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you want to change. Keep reading Atomic Habits, and remember that small consistent actions compound over time.\n\nYou've got this.

        "gemini_comment": "Okay, deep breaths. You're 18, and while it feels like the world is ending, you've got time to turn things around. It's awesome you're already looking into Atomic Habits – that's a solid start.\n\nFirst, the college stuff. Honesty is the best policy, but it needs to be delivered carefully. With your dad and the scholarship, could you frame it as \"I had a really rough transition to college and struggled more than I anticipated. My grades aren't where they need to be, and I'm working on a plan to improve.\" Then, *immediately* follow that with your plan. This shows you're taking responsibility.\n\nAs for the plan, consider talking to your college advisor ASAP. Explain the situation. They might have resources like tutoring, counseling, or even a way to retroactively withdraw from some classes. Don't skip the second semester without talking to them first – you might be able to salvage something.\n\nNow, the addiction and procrastination. You're right, \"just do it\" doesn't work. You've identified the triggers (boredom, stress, easy access). Since blockers aren't working, try a more drastic approach: can you move your computer to a more public space in your house? Or even better, do your work at the library? Out of sight, out of mind can be powerful.\n\nRegarding the random kitchen trips and naps, that sounds like avoidance. Your brain is looking for anything other than the task at hand. Break down your work into *tiny* chunks. Like, \"I will work on this assignment for 15 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.\" Set a timer. During the break, do something completely different – stretch, listen to music, *not* games or anything addictive. The Pomodoro Technique might be helpful here.\n\nAlso, address the chair situation. A comfortable workspace makes a huge difference. Even a cheap ergonomic chair from a used furniture store would be an improvement.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix everything overnight. Celebrate small wins. If you manage to work for 30 minutes without distractions, that's a victory! Acknowledge it. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. And seriously, talk to your college advisor. They've seen it all before and can offer valuable guidance. You got this.\n"

It could be reading an article, watching a documentary, or listening to a podcast on a topic you know nothing about. Apps like CuriosityStream or Blinkist can be great for this. Also, try to ask more questions in your daily life. When you encounter something you don't understand, make a habit of looking it up. Keeping a journal where you jot down interesting things you learn can also help reinforce your curiosity. Remember, curiosity is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Good luck on your journey!",
        "claude_comment": "Here's what's helped me develop more curiosity and a love of learning: start by following your genuine interests rather than forcing yourself to learn random topics. What naturally catches your attention? That's your gateway to building curiosity.\n\nFor apps, I recommend Pocket to save interesting articles you come across, and Feedly to follow topics/websites that spark your interest. Reddit itself is great too - join subreddits about topics you want to learn more about.\n\nA practical habit that works well is the \"depth first, then breadth\" approach. When something interests you, dig deeper into that specific topic first. Read about it, watch videos, maybe take a free online course. As you learn more, you'll naturally discover connected topics that branch out into other areas. This creates sustainable curiosity because each new thing builds on what you already know and care about.\n\nTry setting aside 30 minutes each day as dedicated \"learning time.\" During this time, explore one topic that genuinely interests you. Take notes, ask questions, look up things you don't understand. Over time, this habit will train your brain to be more naturally curious.\n\nRemember that being curious isn't about knowing everything - it's about maintaining an open, questioning mindset. When you encounter something new, practice asking \"Why?\" and \"How does this work?\" These questions will lead you down interesting paths of discovery.",
        "llama_comment": "One strategy that might help is to start small by dedicating a specific time each day or week to exploring something new, whether it's reading an article on a topic you've never learned about before, listening to a podcast on a subject outside your usual interests, or even just asking someone you know about their hobbies. Consistency is key here, so try to make this a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine. You might also find it helpful to keep a \"curiosity journal\" where you write down questions that come up throughout the day and then look into them later - this can help you stay engaged and motivated to learn more. As for resources, there are some great apps like Curious and Coursera that offer bite-sized learning opportunities on a wide range of topics. Blogs like Farnam Street and Wait But Why often feature in-depth explorations of interesting subjects and might help spark some new interests for you. Remember, the goal is to make curiosity a habit, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - just keep at it and be patient with your progress.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough to just *decide* to be more curious. It's more about building habits that naturally lead you there.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is to start small and focus on *one* area that genuinely interests you, even a little bit. Don't try to learn everything at once. Maybe it's a specific historical period, a type of music, or even just how your phone works.\n\nThen, make it a habit to spend just 15-20 minutes a day on it. Consistency is key. Use that time to read a blog, watch a documentary, listen to a podcast, or even just browse Wikipedia. The point is to engage with the topic in a way that feels enjoyable, not like a chore.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask \"dumb\" questions. Curiosity thrives on asking questions, even if you think you should already know the answer. Sites like Quora or even just Googling things are great for this.\n\nFinally, try to connect what you're learning to your existing interests or daily life. This makes the information more relevant and easier to remember, and it can spark even more curiosity. Good luck!\n"

Since working out and walking your dog are already somewhat in your routine, let's start there.\n\nFor the early morning challenge - don't force yourself to become a morning person overnight. Try shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier each week. When you do wake up, immediately put on your workout clothes and take your dog for a quick walk. The movement and fresh air will help wake you up naturally.\n\nA solid after-work routine could look like this: Come home, change clothes, 20-minute dog walk, workout for 30 minutes, then cook dinner. The key is doing these activities in the same order every day until they become automatic.\n\nFor cooking, try meal prepping on weekends so you have easy healthy options ready during the week. This frees up time for other activities like pursuing a new hobby.\n\nRemember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. Start with these basics and gradually add more as these become habits. Even 10 minutes of exercise or a quick walk with your dog is better than nothing. Build from there.\n\nWhat specific hobby were you thinking about learning? That could be a great reward activity after completing your core routine.",

To help you establish a consistent routine, let's break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Since waking up early is your biggest challenge, why not start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day? This can give you a small window to ease into your morning routine, whether that's a short walk with your dog or some light stretching to get yourself moving. As you get into this habit, you can gradually increase the wake-up time and incorporate other activities like working out or learning your new hobby. It might also be helpful to establish a calming pre-bedtime routine to improve the quality of your sleep, making it easier to wake up in the morning.

Even a short 20-minute workout is better than nothing.\n\nRegarding waking up early, that's a common struggle. Instead of drastically changing your wake-up time, try shifting it by just 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired time. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep!

Maybe try putting your alarm clock across the room so you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off.\n\nFor the dog walks, could you tie it to something you already do? Like, right after you finish dinner, it's dog walk time. That way, it becomes a habit linked to an existing routine.\n\nFinally, for the new hobby, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nGood luck!",

One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions.

The goal isn't to completely suppress emotions (they're valuable signals), but rather to create some space between feeling and acting so you can make clearer decisions.\n\nHere's what's helped many others in similar situations:\n\nThe \"pause and name\" technique is a good starting point. When you notice strong emotions arising, pause and literally name what you're feeling: \"This is anger\" or \"I'm feeling hopeful right now.\" This small act creates a bit of distance and helps engage your rational mind.\n\nFor bigger decisions, try the 24-hour rule. When emotions are running high, commit to waiting 24 hours before making any significant choices. Write down your thoughts and feelings, then revisit them the next day when you're calmer. You'll often see things differently.\n\nRegular meditation (even just 5-10 minutes daily) can strengthen your ability to observe emotions without being completely swept away by them. Think of it like building a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger this skill becomes.\n\nAlso consider using a decision journal. When facing choices, write down: 1) The situation 2) How you're feeling 3) The logical pros and cons 4) What advice you'd give a friend in the same situation. This helps separate emotional reactions from rational analysis.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to become an emotionless robot - it's to find a healthy balance where feelings inform but don't override your judgment.

One strategy that might help is practicing mindfulness and meditation to increase your self-awareness and ability to recognize when your emotions are taking over. This can help you create a bit of space between your feelings and your decision-making process, allowing you to evaluate situations more logically. Additionally, trying to reframe your thinking by focusing on the facts of a situation rather than how you feel about it can be beneficial. For example, when faced with a decision, try writing down the pros and cons, or talking through your thoughts with a trusted friend or mentor to get an outside perspective. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and remind yourself of them regularly, so when emotions start to cloud your judgment, you can come back to what you know you want to achieve in the long run. Lastly, consider developing a pre-decision routine that gives you time to reflect on your choices, such as waiting 24 hours before making an important decision, to ensure you're acting on logic rather than impulse.

When you feel that strong emotion coming on, try to pause. Literally, just stop and take a few deep breaths. It sounds simple, but it can give you a moment to think.\n\nThen, try to label the emotion. Instead of just feeling overwhelmed, say to yourself, \"Okay, I'm feeling anxious right now,\" or \"I'm feeling really angry.\" Naming it can help you detach from it a little.\n\nAfter that, try writing down the pros and cons of the decision you're facing, focusing on the facts and not the feelings. What are the realistic outcomes? What's the worst that could happen? Sometimes seeing it on paper can bring clarity.\n\nAlso, consider talking to someone you trust – a friend, family member, or therapist.

But instead of falling into the all-or-nothing pattern, set some basic minimum standards - maybe just 3 non-negotiables like brushing teeth, a 10-minute walk, and one healthy meal. This way you get the psychological relief of a \"day off\" without the guilt and physical discomfort afterward.\n\nYou could also experiment with building more small breaks into your regular schedule. Maybe that means one evening per week where you deliberately take it easier, or building in some flexibility around your usual routines. This might help prevent the buildup that leads to those crash days.\n\nRemember - sustainability beats intensity. It's better to maintain 80% effort consistently than to swing between 100% and 0%. You're already achieving an incredible amount - now it's about finding that sweet spot where you can maintain it long-term.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're experiencing a phenomenon known as \"discipline fatigue\" or \"self-regulation depletion,\" where your usual high level of discipline and self-control gets exhausted, leading to these low days. This can happen when you're consistently pushing yourself to maintain a very high standard across multiple areas of your life. It's not uncommon for people who are highly disciplined to have days like this, as it's almost like your brain is rebelling against the constant pressure to perform.\n\nOne strategy that might help is to build in some intentional \"rest days\" or \"relaxation days\" into your schedule, where you give yourself permission to take a break from your usual routine and just do whatever feels easy and enjoyable. This could be as simple as taking a Sunday morning off from yoga and cleaning, or dedicating one evening a week to watching your favorite TV show without feeling guilty.\n\nAnother approach might be to try to identify what triggers these low days - is it stress at work, feeling overwhelmed with school, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of what's driving these episodes, you can start working on ways to mitigate those factors. For example, if you find that you're more likely to have a low day after a particularly tough week at work, you could try building in some extra self-care activities on Fridays to help you unwind.\n\nIt's also worth considering the idea that these low days might not be entirely negative - sometimes our brains just need a break from the constant pressure to perform, and allowing ourselves to indulge in some guilty pleasures can actually be a form of self-care. The key is to find a balance between giving yourself permission to relax and not letting those relaxation days turn into regret-filled binges.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to not be perfect all the time - it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to maintain this incredibly high level of discipline and productivity, and that can be exhausting. Try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's normal to have off days, and that you can always get back on track tomorrow.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're crushing it most of the time, which is awesome! Don't beat yourself up too much about those off days. It's pretty common, even for disciplined people, to have occasional \"reset\" days.\n\nInstead of viewing them as failures, maybe try reframing them as a necessary part of your routine. Think of it like a scheduled maintenance day for your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nA couple of things you could try: First, experiment with scheduling these days in advance. If you know roughly when they're coming, you can plan for them. Maybe even make a \"lazy day kit\" with healthier snacks, a good book, and a comfy blanket. That way, you're still taking a break, but in a slightly more mindful way.\n\nSecond, explore what triggers these days. Is it stress from work, studying, or something else? Identifying the cause can help you address the underlying issue and potentially reduce the frequency of these days. Maybe incorporate more relaxation techniques into your regular routine, like meditation or spending time in nature.\n\nFinally, remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Don't let these occasional days derail your overall momentum. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track the next day. You've got this!\n"

I’ve gotten so lazy even though I work 6 days a week im usually always on my phone. My job is easy. I don’t even know how im still hired there. I’m so addicted to food. I’m so consumed by my phone. I’ve gotten so lazy I just do the minimum. I take 1-2 classes a quarter. I workout and eat just good enough to maintain the hard work and fitness I have worked for over the years. I make sure I am hygienic and clean. I have no motivation to do more than the minimum. I barely holding on. Procrastinating everything. I just can’t believe I spend a majority of my day staring at this fucking phone an average of 6-8 hours screen time. SIX TO EIGHT HOURS SCREEN TIME EVERYDAY . Like im zoned in and unaware of the real world. I take medication for adhd 5 days a week. Im a mess. I am trying to read more books and learn more. I just don’t know how to do this.\n\n\nI have this notebook. I am writing down all my goals and bullet points on how I can achieve those goals then everyday I wanna write down my plans /to do list for the day. I also wanna use this to journal rather than use my notes app. I will still use my notes app but not as much.\nI know I need to first fix my sleep. I THINK I can do that since I can look forward to sleep if im actually tired. So I think I can get that down. I know 2nd I need to reduce my\nScreen time. I will do this by setting screen time restrictions on my\nPhone and putting my phone far away when going to sleep. I also need to have a set food schedule. I need to  stop buying junk food for now. If someone offers a cookie, sure. But I will not willingly buy anymore junk food regularly. And I will write down what I eat and what I plan to eat. I will write out my whole plan for the day \n\nNow everything In between is what will make me fail. It’s the boredom and lack of motivation. Don’t give me that “it’s discipline not motivation” yeah well no shit. Why do u think depressed people are less ambitious than mentally healthy people? You can’t just say “suck it up” to everyone because it DOESNT WORK…. you think I haven’t tried to suck it up? \n\nWhat I’m asking for is brain hacks. Ways to stay on track. Ways to get shit done. How to deal with the boredom . How to stay consistent. How to stop failing. How to resist my phone. How to deal with the boredom long enough so that discipline becomes fun and easy. How to not feel excruciating boredom when I am not on TikTok or Netflix or Hulu or YouTube.  How to stop thinking of food when I am legitimately addicted to food and can’t stop thinking of it.  I wanna start now but I feel stuck. I can’t explain it I feel trapped . I feel trapped. I’m trapped. I stay stuck with these addictions and not changing, this I stay trapped. If I try to get disciplined I go crazy from boredom and anger and I hate my life because I don’t wanna fucking do the task and when I start the fucking task I take forever because my phone distracts me or I take long because the task is so boring it’s so boring boring boring  I know it will get better but for now how do I deal with this boredom?!!\n\nPLEASE IM BEGGING U HELP ME",

        "best_comment": "Disclaimer: none of this may be helpful, but I’ll give you what has worked for me at different points in my life. I’m just jotting down thoughts as they come so this might not be very organized, but the lessons/ ideas should still come thru. If you find this helpful and want me to clarify or add more things I’ve tried just reply back\n\nI think brain hacks can help, but it seems like different ones will work at different times of your life and work for some and don’t work for others.\n\nI have had varying degrees of laziness and problems with motivation throughout my life.\n\nI’ve gone through periods where I’ve had nothing going on, playing video games all day and not even being able to have a sleeping routine. I tried so many ways during this period to be more productive and get out of the rut, but was unsuccessful. During this period I realized that I only was able to do things out of necessity. I had to have some kind of commitment that I was locked into and had to work towards. Like having a job that you force yourself to show up for because you don’t want to let people down and need the money. After learning this I went to the extreme and locked myself into a contract with the Air Force. I knew that once in I wouldn’t be able to just quit and I’d be forced to take action because there wasn’t another choice. My point is, you don’t need to join the military, but if you can find commitments in your life that would force you to take action maybe this could be a step in the right direction and possible solution to force yourself out of a rut.\n\nAt other points in my life the power of positive thinking helped. I read countless books over the course of years before I actually understood exactly what this meant. Anytime you look up how to get motivated or disciplined or whatever you get the same answers. Mindfulness, gratitude, positive thinking. I was always left thinking this is some blanket statement thrown out that didn’t actually mean anything and certainly didn’t help. Maybe there’s some truth to that, but regardless here’s what I learned worked for me in this realm. To me, It’s the process of changing your identity and reinforcing it. If you tell yourself and believe that you’re in shape or an athlete, it’s much easier to talk yourself into regular exercise because you believe the act of exercise is to the core of who you are. So anytime you are about to do something productive start by saying I am this, and then reinforce it with the actual act. Before you workout tell yourself I am an athlete and then reinforce it to yourself by exercising even if it’s for 10 min. Another example, tell yourself you a disciplined person and then read 10 pages of a book. Tell yourself you are mentally strong and then take a 2 min cold shower. It might sound crazy, but I’ve really noticed a difference after just a few weeks of doing this. You don’t need to do a half hour meditation routine everyday to reap the benefits of positive self talk.\n\nOn this topic, at one point of my life I was so miserable that all of my thoughts were negative. I would hold onto any failure or things I didn’t accomplish and beat myself up for it. This process of constantly thinking about the negative made me feel so much worst. I found out how much it was affecting me because one day on my way home from work I finally snapped and silenced my mind. Anytime I had a negative thought I would just shut it out. I would literally tell myself to shut up. I felt better immediately. Since then I’ve made a rule to just never think negative thoughts, I just have never found a time when they’ve been useful.\n\nWhile constantly researching and trying things to change my discipline my process would usually go like this. I would learn one thing, try it, maybe it helped a bit. I’d forget about it look up some new technique, maybe it worked, forget about it. Rinse, repeat. I’ve learned that being organized and having things written down and having reminders helps to stay consistent. \n\nWhat helps me to do this is to always be running a 30 day challenge. I print out a habit tracker every month with a box for each action on each day to check off. I hold myself accountable by doing this with my partner and it has become a rivalry between us. We put conditions for the challenge where if one of us doesn’t check all the boxes in a day we have to do the punishment of the others choosing. For me if I don’t do my list I have to watch a marvel movie (which I hate) funny enough this has been a huge deterrent from me not completing my list. Not because the movie would be such a bad thing, but more out of stubbornness to not give my partner the satisfaction lol. One more thing to add I. This is to include things on your challenge that are obtainable and work yourself up each month. Discipline is like a muscle you have to work out to get continually stronger. You can’t go from being completely undisciplined one day to having completely disciplined the next. You have to work yourself up to it. Make sure to include things on the challenge like positive reinforcements before each task.\n\nOne of my items on my list is to create a “time box” for each day. This is a daily timed planner that outlines what I need to do for the day and at what time I need to accomplish it by. Keeps me organized and not save everything for the later part of the day so I don’t have to do everything at one time.\n\nFinally give yourself some grace. It’s not easy to do these things, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Just remember that you are not alone, most people deal with the same things. Perspective is key, change the way you see things. Don’t say things like I have to go to work say I get to go to work, at least you have a job. Instead of saying I have to drive my busted up car say I get to drive my car, at least you have one, many people don’t. Chances are you are probably in a better spot than you think in comparison to how things could be. Be grateful for who you are and what you have. You could be sick and not able to do anything. I saw a video the other day that had someone asking if I offered to give you 10 million dollars would you take it. Everyone of course said yes. He then said okay I could give you this 10 million dollars, but you’ll only live for another week. Everyone then changed their mind. It stuck with me. I’m grateful to be healthy and though the money would be nice I’m happy to be healthy.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Thank you. I am trying one day at a time. The food thing is very hard as well as the phone. I’ve improved in some aspects, we pray 5x a day in our religion and I became a looot more consistent with that, I quit alcohol and drug phase from high school, more consistency with school, the medication helped me reduce my binge eating so I don’t feel as depressed and lost weight. \n\nI just feel like when some things are good, there are still a million things that are bad. Like sure I improved in these areas, but then I’m addressed with so much more responsibility and possibly getting married , and dealing with family and stress and I look around seeing an unorganized room when i know I have time to clean I’m just lazy.  Procrastinating important things. It scares me for the future especially for marriage. \n\nI appreciate your time to post this. I think food and screen time are my biggest weaknesses for now. Too much entertainment makes  the rest of life so dull. I will try to reduce carbs possibly try keto again and try to find other things to do aside from this stupid addictive phone.",
        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make changes. It sounds like you're already on the right track with some solid ideas, like using a notebook for goals and setting screen time limits. Here are a few more tips that might help:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It’s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one habit to focus on first, like reducing screen time or improving sleep, and build from there.\n\n2. **Pomodoro Technique**: This can be a game-changer for dealing with boredom and procrastination. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It can make tasks feel less daunting and help you stay focused.\n\n3. **Find Alternatives**: Replace phone time with something engaging but less addictive. Try podcasts, audiobooks, or even a new hobby that doesn’t involve screens.\n\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a big focus, try to eat mindfully. Pay attention to your meals without distractions, which can help reduce cravings and make eating more satisfying.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community where you can check in regularly. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can boost motivation.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for small achievements. It can be as simple as enjoying a favorite snack or taking a relaxing bath.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it’s okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You’ve got this!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - I really get the struggle with phone addiction and boredom. Let me share some practical \"brain hacks\" that can help you break free from this cycle.\n\nFirst, for the phone addiction: Install an app like Forest that gamifies staying off your phone. When you want to focus, you plant a virtual tree that grows while you don't touch your phone - if you break focus, the tree dies. It sounds simple, but it taps into our brain's reward systems in a positive way. Start with just 25 minute growing sessions.\n\nFor dealing with the crushing boredom: Your brain is currently wired to expect constant stimulation from social media. You need to gradually rewire it. Start with very short periods away from your phone - even just 5-10 minutes. During these breaks, do something physical that engages your senses - take a walk, do some stretches, or even just make tea mindfully. The key is to make it through those initial uncomfortable moments.\n\nAbout the food addiction: Keep a \"craving journal\" where you note the time, intensity, and what triggered each craving. This helps separate the physical hunger from emotional eating. When cravings hit, try the \"urge surfing\" technique - observe the craving like a wave that will eventually pass instead of fighting it.\n\nFor getting tasks done: Use the \"5-minute rule.\" Tell yourself you only have to work on something for 5 minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll naturally want to continue. If not, that's fine - you still made progress. The key is making the initial barrier tiny.\n\nThese aren't instant fixes, but they're proven techniques that work with your brain's natural patterns instead of against them. Start implementing just one of these today - maybe the Forest app or the 5-minute rule. Small wins build momentum.\n\nRemember: You're not trapped - you're in transition. Every time you resist an urge or focus for even a few minutes, you're literally rewiring your brain's reward pathways. It gets easier with practice.",
        "llama_comment": "I can feel your desperation and frustration, and I'm here to offer some suggestions that might help. First, it's great that you've identified the areas you want to improve, such as reducing screen time, fixing your sleep, and developing a healthier relationship with food. Those are all excellent starting points. \n\nOne strategy that might help you deal with boredom is to start small and make your tasks more manageable. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, break down your goals into tiny, almost ridiculously easy tasks. For example, if you want to start reading more, commit to reading for just 5-10 minutes a day. If you want to work on a project, start by dedicating 15-20 minutes to it each day. This can help build momentum and make the task less overwhelming.\n\nAnother approach is to find ways to make your tasks more engaging. If you're bored with a particular activity, try to find a way to make it more interesting. For example, if you're trying to learn something new, watch videos or listen to podcasts on the topic instead of just reading about it. If you're working on a project, try to find a way to make it more creative or challenging.\n\nTo resist the temptation of your phone, you might consider implementing some physical barriers, such as putting your phone in a different room or using a website blocker. You could also try replacing your phone time with other activities that bring you joy, such as drawing, journaling, or taking a walk.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to feel bored sometimes, and it doesn't mean you're failing. It's normal for our brains to wander and get distracted, especially when we're trying to develop new habits. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge the feeling and gently bring your focus back to the task at hand.\n\nLastly, consider seeking out accountability and support from friends, family, or a therapist. Having someone to talk to and share your struggles with can make a big difference in staying motivated and on track.\n\nRemember, developing discipline and breaking addictions is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you. Keep moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out and already planning some changes is a huge first step. You're not alone in this struggle.\n\nFirst off, that notebook idea is solid. Writing things down makes them real. Start small with your daily plans – maybe just 2-3 key tasks. Don't overwhelm yourself.\n\nAbout the boredom... you're right, just \"sucking it up\" doesn't work. You need to actively replace the addictive stuff with something else. Since you're already working out, maybe try timing your workouts and trying to beat your personal best. Gamify it. Or, since you're reading more, try finding books that are super engaging, like thrillers or mysteries, to really pull you in. Audiobooks can also be great for when you're doing chores or walking.\n\nFor the phone addiction, the screen time restrictions are good, but also think about *why* you're reaching for it. Is it boredom? Loneliness? Stress? If you can identify the trigger, you can find a healthier coping mechanism. Maybe it's a quick walk, a few minutes of meditation, or calling a friend.\n\nFood is tough. You're on the right track with cutting out the junk food. Instead of focusing on what you *can't* have, focus on what you *can* have. Explore new healthy recipes. Make cooking an activity. And don't beat yourself up if you slip up – just get back on track with the next meal.\n\nAs for staying consistent, try the \"two-minute rule.\" If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. It's a small win that can build momentum. Also, celebrate your small victories. Did you resist the urge to check your phone for an hour? Awesome! Acknowledge it.\n\nFinally, remember that discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about progress. You're going to have bad days. The key is to not let those bad days derail you completely. Just keep showing up and trying your best. You got this.\n"

It might help to remind yourself that everyone has room for improvement and that criticism is a part of learning and growing. Also, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of being human. Over time, this mindset shift can help you become more resilient to criticism. Lastly, consider setting small goals to expose yourself to constructive feedback regularly, like asking a trusted friend for their honest opinion on something specific. This can help you gradually build up your tolerance and learn to handle criticism more effectively.",
        "claude_comment": "Learning to handle criticism better is a skill that can definitely be developed with practice. One effective approach is to start viewing criticism as valuable feedback for growth rather than a personal attack. When someone offers criticism, try to pause and ask yourself \"What can I learn from this?\" instead of immediately feeling defensive.\n\nA practical exercise you can try: The next time you receive criticism, write it down word-for-word and wait 24 hours before reflecting on it. This cooling-off period helps separate the emotional reaction from the actual content of the feedback. You'll often find that what felt devastating in the moment looks much more manageable the next day.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that receiving criticism usually means you're putting yourself out there and trying things - that's something to be proud of. Even the most successful people face regular criticism. The difference is they've learned to filter it: take what's useful, discard what isn't, and keep moving forward.\n\nStart small. Maybe practice with minor critiques from people you trust, and gradually work your way up to handling tougher feedback. Over time, you'll build that mental muscle of resilience, just like any other skill.\n\nRemember: someone taking the time to give you feedback often means they see potential in you and want to help you improve. That's actually a compliment in disguise.",
        "llama_comment": "Developing thicker skin to criticism is definitely achievable with practice and the right mindset. One strategy you could try is to separate your self-worth from the criticism itself - remember that just because someone criticizes one aspect of your work or behavior, it doesn't define your entire worth as a person. It might also help to reframe criticism as an opportunity for growth and improvement, rather than as a personal attack. When you receive criticism, try to focus on the specific issue being addressed and what you can learn from it, rather than taking it as a reflection of your overall character. Additionally, consider seeking out constructive feedback from people you trust, which can help you build resilience and develop a more nuanced understanding of how to use criticism to your advantage. It's also important to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone receives criticism at some point - it's how you respond to it that matters. By gradually exposing yourself to constructive criticism and working on your self-perception, you can build up your resilience over time and develop a more confident attitude towards feedback.",

Ask a friend or professor for specific feedback on a project or presentation. This helps you get used to hearing critiques and allows you to practice responding constructively.\n\nAlso, remember that not all criticism is valid. Sometimes people are projecting their own insecurities or just having a bad day. Learn to discern between constructive criticism and just plain negativity. If it's not helpful or accurate, let it roll off your back. It takes practice, but you can definitely build up that resilience!\n"

The quality matters as much as quantity - try keeping your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.\n\nSome practical tips to stay alert during the day:\nGet some morning sunlight right after waking up - it helps set your circadian rhythm.\nStay hydrated and eat regular meals with protein and complex carbs rather than heavy, sugary foods.\nTake short walks every couple hours, especially when you feel drowsy.\nSit near windows for natural light when possible.\nTry standing or walking during calls/meetings when you can.\n\nIf you're doing all this and still constantly fighting sleep, it's worth seeing a doctor to check for underlying issues like sleep apnea or vitamin deficiencies. There's no shame in getting medical help - better sleep can transform your whole life.\n\nStart with these basic changes and track your energy levels for a couple weeks. Small tweaks to your daily routine often make a bigger difference than willpower alone.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're acknowledging the issue and seeking help. While it's possible that you might be experiencing hypersomnia, it's also important to consider other factors that could be contributing to your sleepiness, such as your sleep schedule, diet, and overall lifestyle habits. Before jumping to conclusions, you might want to try a few things to see if they make a difference. For starters, establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help improve the quality of your sleep. Additionally, getting some morning sunlight exposure can help regulate your circadian rhythms, which can help you feel more alert during the day. In terms of staying awake during the day, taking short breaks to stretch or move around can be really helpful - even just a few minutes of fresh air or a short walk can make a big difference. You could also try incorporating some caffeine into your daily routine, but be careful not to overdo it. Lastly, it might be worth speaking with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleepiness. As for whether it's laziness or not, I'd say it's unlikely - it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and seek help for something like this, so kudos to you for taking the first step!",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's rough trying to stay awake when your body just wants to shut down. Before jumping to conclusions about hypersomnia or laziness, let's look at some common culprits and simple fixes.\n\nFirst, are you getting enough sleep at night? Aim for 7-9 hours. A consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends) can make a huge difference.\n\nNext, think about your diet. Are you eating balanced meals or relying on sugary snacks and caffeine for energy? Those can lead to crashes. Try incorporating more protein and complex carbs.\n\nAlso, dehydration can cause fatigue. Keep a water bottle with you and sip on it throughout the day.\n\nDuring those sleepy moments, try these: Stand up and stretch, take a quick walk, splash cold water on your face, or engage in a brief, stimulating conversation. If possible, get some natural light.\n\nIf these don't help and the sleepiness is seriously impacting your life, it's worth talking to a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Good luck!\n"

For iPhone, you might want to check out an app called \"Freedom.\" It allows you to block specific apps and websites for set periods, and once the block is active, there's no way to bypass it until the time is up. Another option is \"Forest,\" which gamifies staying off your phone by growing a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Both can be great tools to help you stay focused. Also, since you mentioned needing to answer calls, you can customize your Do Not Disturb settings to allow calls from certain contacts while blocking other distractions. Keep experimenting with what works best for you, and good luck with your productivity journey!",
        "claude_comment": "There are a few solid app-blocking options for iPhone that are more robust than the built-in Screen Time. Freedom is probably your best bet - it uses VPN configurations to create a true lock that can't be easily bypassed. Forest is another good one that adds a fun twist by growing virtual trees while you stay focused (and killing them if you break focus).\n\nThat said, app blockers are just tools - they work best when combined with other strategies. Since you've already had success with the physical lockbox, you might want to try setting up specific \"phone-allowed\" times during the day where you batch-process calls and messages. This way you're not constantly available but also not missing important communications.\n\nYou could also try moving distracting apps off your home screen and into a folder on the last page, or even deleting and reinstalling them only during designated usage times. The extra friction often helps reduce mindless checking.\n\nRemember that the goal isn't to permanently lock yourself out, but to build better usage habits over time. Start with short blocking periods (30-60 mins) and gradually increase them as you get more comfortable with focused work. Good luck with finding the right solution for your needs!",
        "llama_comment": "You might want to check out apps like Freedom, SelfControl, or Moment. These apps allow you to block specific apps or websites on your iPhone for a set period of time, and they're more restrictive than the built-in Screen Time feature. For example, Freedom can block social media or other distracting apps across all your devices, while SelfControl is an open-source app that can block any app or website you specify. Another option is Cold Turkey, which can block apps or websites on your iPhone and also has a feature to lock you out of certain apps during certain times of the day. These apps often have more robust locking mechanisms than Screen Time, so you won't be able to bypass them with just two clicks. It's worth noting that some of these apps may require you to set up a password or use another form of authentication to unlock them, which can add an extra layer of discipline to your app-blocking routine.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get the struggle! It's tough when willpower alone isn't enough.\n\nFor iPhone apps that *really* lock you out, check out \"Freedom\" or \"Forest.\" Freedom blocks distracting apps and websites across all your devices, and it's pretty hardcore about it. Forest is a bit different – you plant a virtual tree, and if you leave the app, the tree dies. It's a visual motivator.\n\nBeyond apps, have you considered *why* you're reaching for those apps in the first place? Maybe try identifying your triggers. Are you bored? Stressed? Once you know what's causing the urge, you can find healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nAlso, instead of just blocking apps, try replacing them with something positive. If you usually scroll Instagram, maybe have a book ready to read instead.\n\nFinally, remember that discipline is a skill, not an innate trait. It takes practice and you'll slip up sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it, just learn from it and keep going. Good luck!\n"

      "body": "\nI am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it’s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. \nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\nIs it too much to ask ?

        "gpt_comment": "Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\n\nSince you’re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nRemember, it’s all about finding a balance that works for you. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there! Your situation is totally manageable - lots of working professionals face similar challenges with balancing work, cooking, and self-care. Here's what's worked well for others:\n\nMeal prep is going to be your best friend. Pick one day (maybe Sunday) to do most of your cooking for the week. Make larger batches of curry, dal, or whatever you enjoy, and portion them out. You can freeze some portions for later in the week. This front-loads the time investment so you're not cooking daily.\n\nFor weekday cooking, start with a \"capsule kitchen\" approach. Keep a limited but versatile set of ingredients that can make multiple dishes. Rice, lentils, common vegetables, and basic spices. This reduces both shopping time and decision fatigue.\n\nSince you're not keen on hiring help (which is completely understandable), try breaking housework into small daily tasks rather than letting it pile up. Maybe 15 minutes of cleaning in the morning and washing dishes right after eating. Put on some music or a podcast - it makes chores more enjoyable.\n\nFor morning routine, instead of forcing yourself to wake up super early, focus first on consistency. 8am is fine! Build a reliable routine at that time before trying to shift earlier. A consistent wake time will actually help you feel more energized than constantly fighting to wake up earlier.\n\nConsider doing quick workouts at home to save commute time to a gym. Even 20 minutes of yoga or bodyweight exercises can make a big difference. You could do this while your breakfast is cooking.\n\nRemember - you don't have to perfect everything at once. Start with one area (like meal prep) and once that becomes routine, add another habit. Small, sustainable changes add up to big improvements over time.",

First, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of cooking for yourself and wanting to manage your household independently. To save time physically and mentally, consider implementing a few strategies: meal prep on weekends or one day a week, plan your meals for the next few days, and make a grocery list to avoid last-minute shopping trips. You can also look into simple, one-pot recipes that don't require a lot of cleanup. \n\nFor managing your household chores, try breaking them down into smaller tasks that you can fit into your daily routine, like washing dishes immediately after dinner or dedicating 10-15 minutes to tidying up each day. As for waking up earlier, it's great that you're trying to adjust your schedule - start by setting small, achievable goals, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and use that time for a short workout or some stretching.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect; it's about finding a balance that works for you. You might need to experiment with different routines and schedules before finding what suits you best. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything right away - focus on making progress, and celebrate your small wins along the way.

It's great that you're trying to build healthier habits and manage your own space.\n\nFirst, about the food situation: meal prepping is your friend. Since you're already thinking about chopping veggies in advance, dedicate a couple of hours on the weekend to prepping all your ingredients for the week. Think about batch cooking too – make a big pot of something on Sunday that you can eat for lunches or dinners for a few days. There are tons of simple recipes online that require minimal effort. Also, don't feel like every meal has to be a gourmet experience. Sometimes a simple salad or a quick stir-fry is perfectly fine.\n\nRegarding housework, maybe try setting a timer for 15-20 minutes each day to tackle one specific task, like dishes or wiping down surfaces. Small bursts of focused effort can make a big difference. You could also break down cleaning into smaller, more manageable chunks throughout the week.\n\nAs for the maid situation, I get your hesitation. Maybe you could try finding someone through a trusted referral or a reputable agency that does background checks.

Maybe try a 10-minute stretching routine or a quick walk before work. Gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get more comfortable.\n\nFinally, remember to be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect, and there will be days when you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. It's all about progress, not perfection.

      "body": " My shitty sleep schedule is making my depression worse. The problem is that its a negative feedback loop. The later I stay up the less willpower I have to force myself to go to sleep.\n\nI take Wellbutrin and it will keep me awake if I take it after like 9 am. The problem is that when I stay up till 2 am, and take it at 10 am I end up staying awake till 3 am the next night. Negative feedback loop!\n\nI've tried all the things I can think of, that aren't just forcing myself to go to sleep because that's the one thing I can't do. I don't have insomnia, I can fall asleep fine as soon as I decide I want to. I get tired.The problem is that I never want to go to sleep. I hate my job and dread getting up and going to work in the morning. I don't want the freedom of \"after work\" to end.\n\nI work from home and my hours are flexible, it's way too easy to stay up till 2 by justifying that my first meeting isn't till 10:30 the next day. But 2 turns into 4 and pretty soon I’m only getting 6 hours of sleep. \n\nI probably get around 6 - 7 hours of sleep a night. I know it doesn't sound terrible, but I know it is making my severe depression and fatigue even worse. Sometimes it feels like a form of self harm. I force myself to stay awake even when I’m not enjoying it. Even when I’m tired and feel sleepy. I don’t let myself go to sleep. \n\nI never really want to do anything but lay in bed on YouTube or Reddit and pretend that I don’t exist. I use my willpower to force myself to get out of bed and go to work, buy groceries, eat food, shower and go to the gym. I never look forward to anything, I even dread things I enjoy. Every minute of my life is a fight to push myself to continue. Every day I plan on going to sleep early, but by bedtime I’ve run out of willpower and just can’t make myself do it. \n\nI’ve done all the things that daytime me can to make nighttime me sleep:\n\n* Red filters on all devices\n* Blue light blocking glasses\n* A sad light box to use in the mornings (haven’t really used it though, because I keep waking up with a light sensitive headache from sleep deprivation.)\n* An analog alarm that is incredibly loud in the bathroom (I turned it off and went back to sleep)\n* Sunrise alarm clock (Hurt my eyes and made headache worse)\n* LED strips programmed to gradually turn on before wake up time\n* Taking nighttime meds (one of which has sleepiness as a side effect) at 10 pm\n* Taking melatonin, magnesium, GABA and L theanine (Makes me sleepy, but I just stay up anyway and feel like shit)\n* Putting phone charger away from bed (I just ended up not charging my phone)\n* Setting my phone to automatically shut down at 2 am (I just turn it on again)\n* Having a nice bedtime routine with a cup of herbal tea\n* Telling myself that if I get up early enough I’ll go buy a treat from a nearby coffee shop (I just didn’t get up anyway) \n\nNighttime me is a clever bitch who can disable anything daytime me sets up to make myself sleep. The things on the list do make me tired, but I just stay awake anyway. I seem to have no consideration for my future self’s suffering so morning wake up calls do nothing. How do I fix this?",

        "percentile_10_comment": "Yea, I kinda had a feeling that the WFH situation was the biggest problem. I'm assuming you already realized this. I know you don't want to switch, but if your in the US there are a metric fuckton of job openings right now. I'd seriously consider it. If not, try to find a reason to go put and mingle, but with something productive and preferably a support group. I did language exchanges to learn Spanish and would use meetup.com and it made going out (which I hate, BTW) extremely fun. If you have a hobby, or maybe could make yourself get into one that has a group that does meetups I'd try that. Also, as for melatonin try .3 mg. I assume you have melatonin pills (I recommend getting the Natrol brand liquid dosed at 1mg and taking one dropper full which is .3mg, roughly) just about 1/15, basically a tiny nibble off the edge and try that. I used to have to take a double dose of Tylenol PM in addition to 5mg of melatonin just to fall asleep. I experienced major memory problems in my 20's until I researched and found the active ingredient in Tylenol PM could cause early onset dementia. Then I found research that showed .3mg of melatonin to be the best sleep aid. Now I can fall asleep at will, and have no issues not wanting to sleep, or fatigue and memory issues like before.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help you break the cycle:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul your entire sleep schedule at once, aim to go to bed just 15 minutes earlier each night. This gradual change can be more manageable and less overwhelming.\n\n2. **Create a Reward System**: Since you mentioned you dread mornings, try setting up a small reward for yourself if you manage to get up at a certain time. It could be something simple like a special breakfast or a few minutes of a favorite podcast.\n\n3. **Limit Screen Time**: You mentioned using YouTube and Reddit at night. Try setting a specific time to turn off screens, maybe an hour before you want to sleep. Use that time to do something relaxing that doesn't involve screens, like reading a book or listening to calming music.\n\n4. **Reflect on Your Day**: Spend a few minutes each evening reflecting on something positive that happened during the day, no matter how small. This can help shift your mindset and make the idea of ending the day feel less daunting.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Help**: If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies tailored to your situation and help you work through the underlying issues contributing to your sleep struggles.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with what works for you. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "It sounds like the core issue isn't actually about sleep - it's about avoiding tomorrow. When we dread our days, staying up late becomes a form of rebellion against our own lives. The technical solutions you've tried are great, but they're band-aids on a deeper wound.\n\nHere's what I suggest: Start with accepting that you can't hate yourself into changing. Instead of viewing sleep as another obligation, try reframing it as an act of self-care. Your body and mind need rest to fight depression effectively.\n\nFor the immediate sleep issue, pick ONE consistent wake-up time and stick to it no matter what time you go to bed. Yes, you'll be exhausted the first few days, but this creates natural sleep pressure for the next night. When your body knows it can't sleep in, it becomes much harder to justify staying up late.\n\nFor the bigger picture - you mentioned hating your job. While job hunting isn't easy, especially with depression, start putting out some applications. Even taking small steps toward change can help reduce that feeling of being trapped that's keeping you up at night.\n\nIn the meantime, try giving yourself something to look forward to in the mornings. Not a \"if I wake up early\" reward, but something scheduled and prepaid - maybe a weekly breakfast with a friend, or an early morning class you enjoy. Create reasons to want to wake up, rather than just forcing yourself to.\n\nRemember: You're not failing at sleep - you're succeeding at staying awake. You clearly have tremendous willpower; you're just currently using it against yourself. Start redirecting that strength toward building the life you won't want to escape from.",
        "llama_comment": "It sounds like you're stuck in a tough cycle, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact of your sleep schedule on your depression. One thing that might be worth trying is to focus on setting small, achievable goals for your nighttime routine, rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. For example, instead of trying to go to bed at 10 pm, try setting a goal to start winding down at 11:30 pm - maybe take a warm bath, practice some gentle stretches, or do some light reading. \n\nIt's also interesting that you mention hating your job and dreading the morning, which might be contributing to your reluctance to go to bed. Have you considered exploring ways to make your work more enjoyable or finding ways to cope with the stress and anxiety it causes? This could be as simple as taking short breaks throughout the day to do something you enjoy, or finding a hobby that brings you joy outside of work.\n\nAdditionally, since you've tried so many different strategies to improve your sleep, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you address the underlying issues driving your behavior. They could help you develop coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your depression and anxiety, which in turn might make it easier to establish a healthier sleep routine.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that it's not necessarily about having \"willpower\" to go to bed, but rather about creating an environment and routine that supports healthy sleep habits. By focusing on small, incremental changes and addressing the underlying issues driving your behavior, you might find it easier to develop a more consistent and restful sleep schedule.",
        "gemini_comment": "Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's really frustrating when you feel like you're fighting against yourself. It's great that you've already tried so many things! Since willpower at night is the issue, maybe we can shift the focus to making sleep easier *before* nighttime you takes over.\n\nFirst, about the Wellbutrin: 10 AM is probably too late if you're aiming for a better sleep schedule. Could you set an alarm for 8 AM (or even earlier) just to take the pill, then go back to sleep? That way, it's processed earlier in the day.\n\nSecond, you mentioned dreading work. That's a huge factor. Is there *anything* you can do to make your job even slightly more bearable? Even small changes can make a difference. If not, could you start exploring other job options, even if it's just browsing listings? Having a sense of future possibility might ease the dread.\n\nThird, let's tackle the \"after work\" freedom. You're clinging to it because it's the only time you feel in control. Instead of trying to eliminate that feeling, can you shift it? Plan something small and enjoyable for the *morning* before work. It doesn't have to be big – a walk in the sun, listening to a favorite podcast, or even just savoring your coffee. This gives you something to look forward to and might make going to sleep less of a loss.\n\nFinally, instead of a hard shutdown at 2 AM, try a gradual wind-down. Set an alarm for 11 PM as a \"screen-free\" reminder. No more YouTube or Reddit after that. Read a book, listen to calming music, or do some light stretching. The key is to make it a gentle transition, not a sudden restriction that nighttime you will rebel against.\n\nIt's going to take time and consistency, but don't give up. Small, sustainable changes are better than drastic measures that you can't maintain. Good luck!\n"

For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\n\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.\n\n**Map out your ideal self**  \nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SMART Goals**  \nWay to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  \nRelevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   \n\n\n**Daily Review**  \nThe hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  \n\n\nSo these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're taking a dance class—that's a fantastic step towards meeting new people and building confidence. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to feel a bit lost. Here are a few ideas to help you get started on your journey:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small, manageable goals that can help build your confidence. It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.\n\n2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields. This could open up new job opportunities and help you feel more accomplished.\n\n3. **Networking**: Since you're shy, try online communities related to your interests. They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.\n\n4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can help build your self-worth and motivate you to keep going.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're already on the right path by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your way. 😊",
        "claude_comment": "Hey there - first off, signing up for that dance class was a great step! It shows you're already taking action to improve your life, which is huge.\n\nLet's break this down into manageable pieces. Rather than trying to change everything at once, start with one area and build momentum from there. Since you mentioned wanting better career prospects, that could be a good focus.\n\nYour art history degree isn't a failure - it shows you can complete complex academic work. Many skills from being an admin coordinator are also transferable. Consider looking into project management certifications (like CAPM) or digital marketing courses - these fields often value people with diverse backgrounds and don't require another full degree.\n\nFor building confidence and connections, keep going with that dance class! Each week you attend is a small win. Maybe challenge yourself to say hello to one new person each class. Small social interactions add up over time.\n\nStart tracking your daily wins, no matter how small. Did you go to dance class? Win. Learned something new at work? Win. This helps build evidence that you're making progress.\n\nRemember that many successful people didn't have it figured out in their early 30s. You're not behind - you're exactly where you need to be to start making changes. Pick one small thing to improve this week and build from there. What's one tiny step you could take today?",
        "llama_comment": "It's amazing that you're recognizing the need for change and taking small steps like signing up for that dance class - that takes a lot of courage, especially when you're shy. One thing you might consider is breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of getting a better job, you could start by updating your resume, or taking online courses to learn new skills. There are many free or low-cost resources available online that can help you build your professional skills, regardless of your education background. As for building your self-worth and self-esteem, it might be helpful to focus on your strengths and the things you enjoy doing, like art history or dance. You could also try setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day or week, and celebrating when you reach them - this can help build momentum and confidence. Remember that changing your life is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now, just start with what feels most important or achievable to you, and go from there.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're feeling stuck, and that's a really common feeling, especially when you're trying to make big changes. It's great that you've already signed up for a dance class – that's a solid first step!\n\nSince you're feeling overwhelmed, maybe try breaking things down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, pick one or two areas to focus on. For example, you mentioned wanting a better job. Could you spend just 30 minutes a day researching potential career paths that might interest you, even if they seem out of reach right now? Or maybe dedicate 15 minutes to learning a new skill online through free resources like Coursera or Khan Academy. Small, consistent effort adds up over time.\n\nRegarding making friends, since you're shy, maybe focus on just one person in your dance class. Instead of trying to be best friends right away, just aim to have a short conversation after class each week. Ask them about their day or what they thought of the choreography. Baby steps!\n\nThe key is consistency, not perfection. Don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Just get back on track the next day. Celebrate the small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this!\n"

      "body": "I've been working from home for a year - will start going to office twice a week from next month.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic I started using my phone excessively.\nThe main addiction for me is mindlessly scrolling through social media. I'll start with Facebook, then go on to Instagram, then Reddit, linkedin and Twitter and then go down a youtube spiral and back to square one to do it all again.\nNow I have multiple accounts on all these platforms and the amount of time I spend on my phone has gone up exponentially. Since last few months it has been hampering my work and productivity as well. I procrastinating and go on my phone and then end up not doing any work all day. I have got away with it so long but I'm really worried thinking about what will happen when I'm in office because I don't want to be checking my phone at all.\nI've tried locking the apps, putting a timer, uninstalling the apps, deactivating my accounts but I still end up finding my way to get back to it within few hours. It makes me feel even worse!\nI would really appreciate any help, advice or even motivation to help me get over this bad habit.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "One solution which worked for one of co-workers is getting a new phone. Don't put any apps in it except the contacts. Leave the other phone containing all the apps at your home or to a neighbour's house (if you are not confident about you going home to fetch it between office hours). Reward yourself at the end of the day by using your old phone. Repeat.",

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really aware of the impact this habit is having, which is a great first step. Here are a few strategies that might help you regain control:\n\n1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Start by designating specific times for phone use. Maybe allow yourself 15 minutes in the morning and evening. Use alarms to remind you when it's time to stop.\n\n2. **Create Friction**: Make it harder to access these apps. You could try moving them to a different screen or folder, or even logging out after each use so you have to log back in every time.\n\n3. **Replace the Habit**: Find an activity to replace the scrolling. It could be reading a book, going for a walk, or even a quick workout. The key is to have something ready to do when you feel the urge to pick up your phone.\n\n4. **Mindfulness Practice**: Sometimes, just being aware of the urge can help. When you feel the need to check your phone, take a moment to pause and ask yourself if it's really necessary.\n\n5. **Accountability**: Share your goal with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware can be a big motivator.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection. Every small step you take away from the phone is a win. Good luck!",
        "claude_comment": "Phone addiction is tough because our devices are designed to be addictive, but going to the office gives you a perfect opportunity for a reset. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:\n\nStart by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete all social media apps and only access them through your browser. This adds friction and makes mindless checking less appealing. Then put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less visually rewarding.\n\nFor the office transition, get a basic morning routine locked in now. Put your phone in another room while you work. If you need it nearby, keep it in a drawer or bag where you can't see it. The physical barrier helps break the automatic reach-for-phone response.\n\nReplace the phone habit with specific activities during breaks. Take a quick walk, chat with coworkers, or read a book. Having predetermined alternatives makes it easier to avoid defaulting to scrolling.\n\nMost importantly, be patient with yourself. You've recognized the issue and are taking steps to address it. That's huge. Start implementing these changes now while WFH so you're prepared for the office. Each day you maintain better phone habits builds momentum for lasting change.\n\nRemember - the goal isn't to never use your phone, but to be intentional about when and how you use it. You've got this.",
        "llama_comment": "It's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to make a change, especially with your work schedule shifting soon. One strategy that might help is to identify the triggers that lead you to mindless scrolling - is it boredom, stress, or something else? Once you know what's driving the behavior, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises when you feel the urge to scroll. \n\nAnother approach could be to set specific phone-free times and zones, like during work hours or in certain areas of your home. Since you've tried app blockers and timers before, you might consider implementing a \"phone dock\" system where you leave your phone in a designated spot, like a docking station or a box, when you're not using it for work or other essential tasks.\n\nIt's also worth exploring why you feel the need to have multiple accounts on all these platforms - is it FOMO, a sense of obligation, or something else? Simplifying your online presence might help reduce the temptation to scroll. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it's a process to break a habit, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help, so that's something to build on.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Phone addiction is a real struggle, especially with the WFH situation. It sounds like you've already tried some of the common solutions, which is good, but let's dig a little deeper.\n\nSince you're heading back to the office soon, let's focus on that as a hard deadline. Start small. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, aim for specific phone-free blocks of time each day leading up to your office return. Maybe start with 2-hour blocks where your phone is in another room. Use a regular alarm clock instead of your phone alarm.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you're reaching for your phone. Boredom? Stress? Loneliness? Identify the triggers and find alternative activities. If it's boredom, maybe have a book or some quick exercises ready. If it's stress, try a short meditation or some deep breathing.\n\nSince you've deactivated accounts before, maybe try a more radical approach: delete the apps entirely and only access those platforms on a desktop browser, and only during specific times. The extra friction of having to log in each time might be enough to deter you.\n\nFinally, don't beat yourself up when you slip up. It's going to happen. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Maybe keep a small journal to track your progress and identify patterns. You got this!\n"

      "body": "\nGrowing up, I didn’t have the motivation as a child. My parents were abusive in their own ways, and to each other. So I think that somewhat had a part in it. My mom got a divorce and that was super stressful on her with 4 kids to raise alone. So that’s 4 kids to constantly help with homework and there’s areas she didn’t remember or know about. No encouragement to join sports, etc. I know it was really hard for her and to keep up with 4 kids. She really tried her best. \n\nI lack knowledge in history, I know very few about our history. It never interested me. Throughout school, were given cheat sheets from our instructors to study from, based off our books. It was easy for us to pass the class. \n\nI was only really good at math in school, some of science, English, writing, etc. \n\nI want to be able to articulate what I’m saying. I can write it out but when I speak, it comes out all scrambled and it makes me even more anxious when I’m talking to someone. \n\nIf a subject doesn’t interest me or I find it boring, it’s very hard for me to continue to learn/finish the assignment. \n\nTo be honest, I don’t read. I used to love it as a child and collected books but idk what happened, I lost interest. I can’t find the motivation or interest to pick up a book. But I’ll read the news here and there, etc. that’s about it. \n\nI want to expand my vocabulary, be able to articulate, learn more about history (idk where to even begin).\n\nI’m not even educated enough in politics, who most of our politicians are, etc. I never had much interest in it. I rarely keep up with the news (rarely watch tv anymore ever since I moved out of my mom’s house), I used to keep up with it with her. \n\nI also have a hard time learning, I think that may be due to me being partially deaf all my life. My ENT doctor refused hearing aids for me since I was a child. I recently met with a different audiologist 2 years ago and ask her about hearing aids and she said I’ve always qualified for it, she seemed really upset that I never received anything. She did mention that I’ve missed out on “so much learning,” from not having hearing aids. \n\nSometimes it’s hard for me to comprehend what I’ve read, and to focus on it. So I’ll have to reread the whole thing again, or that sentence/paragraph, which frustrates me. I can’t sit and read for so long before I get distracted. \n\nI’ve also been going through very, very deep depression. With that, I’m even more disinterested and unmotivated.\n\nI feel SO stupid and uneducated. When people talk to me about history, politics, anything that I lack knowledge in, I get so embarrassed and don’t know how to respond.",

However, they were often late because the assignment required several pages, over subjects I had no interest in. I also can’t sit long and write a few papers in one sitting because I get distracted easily, or I get frustrated easily. \n\nI feel lazy and so stupid/ignorant, because I lack critical information that EVERYONE should know about (history, politics, etc.) Even what seems basic vocabulary to everyone else, I may lack in.

It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate, and it's understandable that learning might have taken a backseat.

Audiobooks might be a great way to reintroduce yourself to reading without the pressure of sitting down with a book.\n\n4. **Practice Articulation**: Try speaking out loud what you've learned, maybe even record yourself. It can help with organizing your thoughts and getting comfortable with speaking.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, everyone learns at their own pace. It's okay to not know everything. Celebrate the small victories and progress you make.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: If depression is making things harder, consider reaching out to a professional.

        "claude_comment": "First off - you're not stupid. You're someone who had a challenging childhood and missed out on some key support systems, including proper hearing assistance that could have made learning easier. The fact that you're here asking these questions shows self-awareness and a desire to grow - that's actually pretty impressive.\n\nLet's start small and build from there. Since you mentioned having trouble focusing and getting overwhelmed, trying to tackle everything at once would probably backfire. Instead, pick ONE area you'd like to improve first. Based on your post, maybe start with reading since that's something you used to enjoy.\n\nHere's a practical approach: Set aside just 10 minutes a day to read. That's it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast or before bed. Start with topics you naturally find interesting - it doesn't have to be heavy history or politics right away. The goal is to rebuild your reading habit and concentration gradually.\n\nFor comprehension issues, try reading out loud (when you're alone) and using your finger to track the words. This engages multiple senses and can help with focus. If you need to reread something, that's completely normal - many people do this, especially with complex material.\n\nOnce you've got a steady reading habit going (give it at least a month), you can start branching out into other subjects. For history and politics, there are some great \"starter\" YouTube channels that break down complex topics into engaging stories. This can be less overwhelming than diving straight into books.\n\nRegarding articulation - practice explaining what you've read to yourself in the mirror. It sounds silly, but it works. Start with simple topics you're comfortable with, then gradually work up to more complex subjects.\n\nMost importantly - be patient with yourself. You're essentially rebuilding neural pathways and learning habits that weren't properly developed earlier. It takes time, but it's absolutely doable. Focus on small, consistent steps rather than trying to transform everything at once.",
        "llama_comment": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like your upbringing and struggles with learning. First, let's ditch the idea that you're \"stupid\" or \"uneducated\" - those labels aren't helpful and don't reflect your potential for growth. It's great that you're recognizing the impact of your past experiences on your current situation, and that you're willing to work on building your knowledge and skills.\n\nGiven your challenges with focus and comprehension, it might be helpful to start small. Instead of trying to tackle a whole book, begin with short articles or podcasts on topics that interest you. You could also try using text-to-speech software or apps that can help with reading comprehension. Additionally, consider exploring different formats for learning, such as documentaries, TED talks, or online courses, which might be more engaging and easier to follow than traditional texts.\n\nIt's also important to address your hearing loss and how it may be affecting your ability to learn. Now that you've had a second opinion from an audiologist, it might be worth exploring hearing aids or other assistive technologies that can help you better absorb information.\n\nAs for building your vocabulary and articulation skills, you could try practicing with a language learning app or website, like Duolingo or Coursera. These resources often have interactive exercises and quizzes that can help you build confidence in your communication skills.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the impact of depression on your motivation and focus. It's essential to prioritize your mental health and seek support from professionals who can help you manage your symptoms. With the right tools and mindset, you can start making progress towards your goals, even if it feels like a small step at a time. Remember that learning is a lifelong process, and it's never too late to start building new skills and knowledge.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, it sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders, but the fact that you're recognizing these things and wanting to improve is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much about the past; focus on what you can do now.\n\nFirst, address the depression. Seriously. It's incredibly difficult to build any kind of discipline when you're dealing with depression. Talk to a doctor or therapist. There are resources available, and getting that under control will make everything else much easier.\n\nSecond, get those hearing aids! The audiologist is right; you've been missing out, but it's not too late. This could significantly improve your comprehension and focus.\n\nFor the learning itself, start small and make it enjoyable. Trying to cram everything at once will be overwhelming. Since you used to love reading, maybe revisit that. Don't force yourself to read dense history books right away. Find a genre you enjoy – fiction, fantasy, whatever – and just start reading for pleasure. Even 15 minutes a day. This will help rebuild the habit and expand your vocabulary naturally.\n\nFor history and politics, podcasts or documentaries can be a great way to learn passively. You can listen while you're doing chores or commuting. Find ones that are engaging and not too dry. \"Stuff You Missed in History Class\" is a popular one.\n\nAs for articulating yourself, practice makes perfect. Try talking to yourself in the mirror about a topic you're learning. Or, even better, find a friend or family member who's willing to listen and give you feedback. Don't be afraid to stumble; it's part of the process.\n\nFinally, be patient with yourself. You're essentially retraining your brain, and that takes time and effort.

Break it down into tiny, daily actions that you can commit to. Consistency is key, so focus on building a routine around these actions. \n\nAlso, consider reflecting on what truly matters to you. Sometimes, writing down your thoughts or talking to someone can help clarify your values and what you want out of life. This can ignite that inner fire you're looking for.

Maybe that's 5 minutes of exercise, reading 2 pages of a book, or spending 10 minutes learning a new skill.\n\nThe key is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about making massive changes right away. Focus on showing up every day for that small commitment. Track it in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar. Those small wins start building momentum and self-trust.\n\nAs for finding purpose - purpose emerges from doing things that matter to you, not from thinking about it. Try different activities and pay attention to what energizes you versus what drains you. What problems do you notice that you'd like to help solve? What topics naturally grab your interest?\n\nRemember that your past doesn't define your future. Each day is a new opportunity to take one small step forward.

Each time you stick to your commitment, you're proving to yourself that you can do it. That builds momentum.\n\nFinally, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. It happens. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You got this!\n"

      "body": ">TLDR:  How do I escape from escapism?\n\nThe title says it all. I find myself escaping from my problems, and indulge myself in other (less important) activities that wastes my time. I understand it won't help me or be productive in anyway but i can't help it. \nAfter a lot of contemplating I figured it's just me trying to escape from everything that's even mildly unpleasant. It is stagnating my growth and I'm just sick of it.\n\nSo I've come here asking for your help",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I'd suggest to try breaking down the 'complex' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)\n\nFor example: \n\n1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you're trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your 'excuse' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. \n\nThe goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being 'complex' or 'scary'. You just see all things you did 'wrong' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren't that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be 'beaten' / fixed.\n\nBesides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to 'stop escaping' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don't need it. Let's cross-check it altogether, let's not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you'd like to stop escaping in first place.\n\n**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let's imagine (for example) it's social media. \n\nFine - for the list of things you 'escaped', out of 10 things - let's imagine that 5 were 'escaped' due to social media distraction. If it's true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it's something else - doesn't matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).\n\n**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before). Getting back to this same file will help you a lot, because it'll be your \"center for fighting escapism\" in some way. And a place where your next decisions/healthy habits might be started from.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "escaping escapism? sounds like getting out a nail with another nail. \nFace your problems head on. It’s the only way. The only way out, is through. I know it sucks, sounds painful, and we want to avoid it, thus our dilemma. \n\nThe more you do it, the less it hurts, the less of a burden it becomes and you just get to know yourself better to bring yourself to do *whatever it is you’re attempting to achieve*",
        "gpt_comment": "Escapism is something a lot of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. One approach to tackle this is to start small and gradually build up your discipline. First, identify the specific activities you use for escapism and set limits on them. For example, if you find yourself binge-watching shows, decide on a specific time limit for watching each day. \n\nNext, try to replace some of that escapism time with activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or going for a walk to clear your mind. \n\nAlso, consider setting small, achievable goals for the tasks you're avoiding. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming. Reward yourself for completing these tasks, even if it's just a small treat or a break to do something you enjoy. \n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to seek help if you need it. Sometimes talking to someone about what you're avoiding can provide new insights and motivation. Keep at it, and be patient with yourself as you work on building better habits.",
        "claude_comment": "Escaping from challenges is a really common human response - our brains are wired to seek comfort and avoid discomfort. The key is gradually building your \"discomfort muscle\" rather than trying to transform overnight.\n\nStart by picking just ONE mildly uncomfortable but important task each day. Set a timer for just 10 minutes and commit to working on it for that short duration. When the timer goes off, you can choose to continue or stop - but usually once you start, it's easier to keep going.\n\nA helpful mindset shift is viewing discomfort as a signal of growth rather than something to avoid. When you notice yourself reaching for escape activities, pause and ask \"What am I trying to avoid right now?\" Then break that challenging thing into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nYou might also try the \"if/then\" technique: \"If I feel the urge to escape into [activity], then I will first spend 10 minutes on [important task].\" This creates a small barrier between the impulse and the escape behavior while building positive momentum.\n\nRemember that perfect discipline isn't the goal - progress is. Even small steps toward facing challenges instead of avoiding them will compound over time. You've already taken a positive step by recognizing the pattern and seeking to change it.",
        "llama_comment": "Escapism can be a tough cycle to break, but recognizing the pattern is a huge first step. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - what are the specific situations or emotions that make you want to escape? Once you know what's driving your escapism, you can start working on more constructive ways to cope with those feelings. For example, if you're avoiding a particular task because it feels overwhelming, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Or, if you're using escapism to avoid stress or anxiety, consider replacing it with a healthier habit like exercise, meditation, or journaling. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and create an environment that supports productivity - this could mean turning your phone off during certain hours of the day, or finding a quiet workspace where you can focus. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and indulge in enjoyable activities occasionally, but by being more mindful of your habits and setting boundaries for yourself, you can start to build more discipline and make progress on the things that matter to you.",
        "gemini_comment": "Hey, I get it. Escapism is a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you've already done the hardest part – recognizing the problem and wanting to change. That self-awareness is huge.\n\nInstead of trying to eliminate escapism entirely (which is super hard), maybe try to manage it and redirect that energy. Start small. Pick *one* thing you're avoiding and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, if you're avoiding studying, commit to just reading one page. Seriously, just one. Often, getting started is the biggest hurdle.\n\nAlso, think about *why* you're escaping. What's the unpleasant thing you're trying to avoid? Is it fear of failure? Boredom? Once you identify the root cause, you can start addressing that directly. Maybe that means finding a study buddy, changing your environment, or just acknowledging that it's okay to not be perfect.\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect overnight. There will be days you slip up. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Small, consistent steps are way more effective than trying to make massive changes all at once. Good luck, you got this!\n"

I waited tables throughout my 20’s and flunked out of college multiple times. \n\nI wanted to know if any women would be willing to share their stories of having a career come back a bit later in life. \n\nI wanted to ask women because I am afraid if I start seriously dating before I get a career going, I will get married have children, and never get the full thriving career I dreamed of. So this is also about finding a partner later in life too I guess. (I know women can have a family and a fulfilling career. I just want to make sure I have some money of my own before settling down) \n\nSo, if there’s any women who like me didn’t have much ambition in her early 20’s but turned it around, how’d you do it?\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated \nThanks\n\nEdit ( Thanks for your stories.

        "gpt_comment": "Hey there! First off, it's awesome that you're thinking about your future and wanting to make a change. It's never too late to start building the career you want. Many women have found success later in life, and you can too. \n\nOne practical step is to identify what you're passionate about or interested in. Once you have a direction, consider taking online courses or certifications to build skills in that area. This can be a flexible way to learn while still working. Networking is also key—connect with people in the field you're interested in, whether through LinkedIn or local meetups. They can offer guidance and maybe even job leads.\n\nAs for balancing dating and career, it's all about setting boundaries and priorities. You can date and still focus on your career goals. Just be clear with yourself and any potential partners about your ambitions. Remember, it's your journey, and you get to decide the pace. You've got this!",
        "claude_comment": "26 is still so young - you have plenty of time to build the career you want! Many successful women started their careers or made major pivots in their late 20s and 30s. Your waitressing experience likely gave you valuable skills in customer service, multitasking, and working under pressure that will serve you well.\n\nThe key is to pick a direction and start taking small, consistent steps. First, identify what career path interests you. Then break down the requirements into manageable chunks - maybe that's finishing a degree, getting certifications, or building specific skills. Start with one class or one certification at a time rather than overwhelming yourself.\n\nRegarding relationships - having your own career and financial independence absolutely makes sense before settling down. But remember that building a career and dating aren't mutually exclusive. You can date while focusing primarily on your professional development. The right partner will support your ambitions.\n\nConsider reaching out to women in fields you're interested in for informational interviews. Many are happy to share their paths and advice. You might also look into professional women's organizations in your area - they often provide mentorship and networking opportunities.\n\nYour past attempts at college don't define your future. What matters is what you do from here. Start small, stay consistent, and keep your eyes on your long-term goals. You've got this!",
        "llama_comment": "I love seeing posts like this because it's a great reminder that it's never too late to make a change. I've seen many women share their stories of turning their lives around in their 20s, 30s, and even 40s, and it's truly inspiring. For you, it might be helpful to start by identifying what's holding you back from pursuing your career goals right now. Is it lack of direction, fear of failure, or something else? Once you pinpoint the obstacle, you can start working on a plan to overcome it. \n\nIt's also great that you're thinking ahead and considering how your future relationships might impact your career aspirations. Having a supportive partner can make a huge difference, but it's equally important to establish your own financial stability and independence before settling down. You might consider setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, like taking online courses, attending workshops, or volunteering in your desired field to gain experience and build your network.\n\nRemember, building a career and finding a fulfilling life is a marathon, not a sprint. It's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. Many women have successfully balanced their careers and family life, and you can too. Keep in mind that it's all about making progress, not perfection. You got this, and it's amazing that you're taking the first steps towards creating the life you want.",

It's super common to feel a bit lost in your early 20s, and it's awesome you're thinking proactively about your future.\n\nFirst off, don't beat yourself up about the past. Waiting tables builds resilience and people skills, and college isn't the only path. It sounds like you're ready for a change, and that's the most important thing.\n\nAs for career advice, maybe start by exploring different fields that genuinely interest you. Informational interviews are gold – reach out to women in careers you admire and ask about their journey. LinkedIn is great for this. You can also try volunteering or taking online courses in areas you're curious about to test the waters without a huge commitment.\n\nRegarding the relationship aspect, it's smart to prioritize your financial independence. Building a career you're proud of will boost your confidence and make you a more empowered partner, whenever you decide to settle down. Don't feel pressured to follow a timeline.\n\nDiscipline-wise, start small. Pick one actionable goal related to your career exploration (e.g., \"apply for one job/internship per week\" or \"complete one online course module\") and track your progress. Celebrate small wins to stay motivated. Consistency is key. You got this!\n"

Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know your triggers, you can work on addressing them directly.\n\n2. **Healthy Alternatives**: Stock up on healthier snacks that you enjoy. If you have a sweet tooth, try fruits like berries or apples. Sometimes just having a healthier option available can make a big difference.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to the taste, texture, and satisfaction of your food. It can help you enjoy your meals more and reduce the urge to snack mindlessly.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try setting small, achievable goals. For example, limit yourself to a certain amount of chocolate per week and gradually reduce it.\n\n5. **Stay Active**: Incorporate some physical activity into your routine. It doesn't have to be intense; even a daily walk can help manage cravings and improve your mood.\n\nRemember, it's about progress, not perfection.

        "claude_comment": "First off, congrats on reducing your rice portions - that's a real win and shows you can make positive changes. For the chocolate and junk food situation, here's what's worked for many people:\n\nStart by not keeping these foods in your house. It's much easier to say no once at the store than multiple times at home when cravings hit. Replace your current snack stash with healthier alternatives you actually enjoy - maybe fruits, nuts, or dark chocolate if you need that chocolate fix.\n\nWhen cravings hit hard, try the 10-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll wait just 10 minutes before giving in. Often the urge passes, but if it doesn't, you can make a more conscious choice rather than acting on impulse. During those 10 minutes, do something engaging - take a walk, call someone, or work on a hobby.\n\nFor lasting change, track your triggers. Notice what situations or emotions lead to snacking. Are you stressed? Bored? Once you know your patterns, you can develop better responses to those triggers.\n\nRemember this is a gradual process. You've already shown you can change habits with the rice portions. Apply that same patience here - focus on progress, not perfection. Each day you make better choices is a step forward, regardless of any setbacks.",

Once you're aware of your triggers, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms, like going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or finding healthier snack options. Additionally, try to make your environment work in your favor - get rid of junk food at home, or avoid walking past the candy aisle at the store. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like cutting back on junk food by one serving per day, and gradually work your way up to making healthier choices.

Maybe early caretakers were hard on you and you learned it from them? Be kind to yourself, and give yourself a hug. Life is hard, and you have a lot on your plate (kids add so much to your daily tasks). You don't owe the world progress or perfection. But you owe yourself kindness. \n\nSomething that helped me a great deal is this book: Taming Your Outer Child by Susan Anderson. It sounds hokey, and the exercises often feel stupid. I don't really buy into all the ideas in that book, but the exercises are compassionate and practical and give you an achievable path forward with an emphasis on building yourself up with kindness. Following the exercises in that book helped me go from bouncing around part-time work, to finally getting my very first full time job at 30. It's not overnight, and it's not linear. I really suggest sticking with it for at least 3 months.\n\nOne exercise I think is appropriate for all ages and you can do with your kids! The \"future you\" exercise can be really fun. Draw the you you want to be 5 years from now, you draw them or write them in as much detail as possible. Then, you write down something (one thing) you can accomplish today to bring yourself a little closer to that person. It can be \"go for a walk\" or \"draw for 5 minutes\" or \"write a list\". If you're feeling froggy it can be bigger, but it should be something you can accomplish easily today. Tomorrow (or next month, like it was for me) you can join that art class at the Y, or join a walking group, but today keep it simple. Do another thing tomorrow. \n\nFinally, please be kind to yourself. Living for your kids is admirable, but you have to live a bit for yourself, too. I'm sure you're children don't see you the way you're saying. Every day is a new day. I promise it will get better.",

First off, remember that wanting to change is a huge first step, and it's clear you care deeply about your kids, which is a powerful motivator.\n\nOne thing that might help is starting with small, manageable goals. It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once, so focus on one thing you can improve each day. Maybe it's setting aside 10 minutes for yourself to do something you enjoy or writing down one thing you're grateful for each day. These small actions can slowly shift your mindset and help you build a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAlso, consider reaching out to a professional who can provide support and guidance tailored to your situation. Sometimes having someone to talk to can make a big difference.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks.

That takes real strength.\n\nThe negative self-talk you're experiencing is a habit, and like any habit, it can be changed with consistent effort. Start by catching yourself when these thoughts come up. Instead of fighting them, simply acknowledge \"That's just my old thinking pattern\" and redirect to something constructive.\n\nA practical way to build new mental patterns is through small daily wins. Pick one tiny thing you can do each day - maybe making your bed, or 5 minutes of exercise, or reading one page of a book. When you complete it, pause and really let yourself feel good about it. No dismissing or diminishing the achievement.\n\nConsider starting a \"wins journal\" where you write down 3 things you did well each day, no matter how small. This helps create evidence that counters those \"don't deserve it\" thoughts. Over time, these small successes stack up and create momentum.\n\nRemember that your kids benefit most from seeing you take care of yourself. By working on your own growth, you're teaching them valuable lessons about resilience and self-worth. You deserve good things not because you've earned them, but because you exist.

First, let me just say that the fact that you're trying your best for your kids and wanting to be better for them is something to be proud of - it shows that you have a lot of love and capacity for growth.\n\nOne thing that might help is to start challenging those negative thoughts by practicing self-compassion. When you catch yourself thinking \"I don't deserve it,\" try to reframe that thought in a more positive and realistic way, like \"I'm doing the best I can as a parent and a person, and that's something to be proud of.\" It might also be helpful to focus on small, achievable goals that you can work towards, which can help build your confidence and sense of self-worth.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to do this alone - consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop more positive thought patterns. And in the meantime, try to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to build on.

You're already taking the first step.\n\nIt's easy to get stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when you feel like you're not where you want to be. Since you're doing this for your kids, maybe try framing small steps as doing it *with* them. Could you start a simple routine together? Like, every day after dinner, you all spend 15 minutes tidying up, or reading, or even just stretching? It's not about perfection, it's about building momentum and showing yourself (and them) that you *can* make positive changes.\n\nAlso, that feeling of not deserving good things? That's a tough one to shake, but it's often based on old beliefs that aren't even true anymore. Maybe try writing down those negative thoughts when they come up, and then challenge them. Ask yourself, \"Is this *really* true? What's the evidence for and against it?\"\n\nFinally, be kind to yourself. You're human, and you're going to have setbacks.
