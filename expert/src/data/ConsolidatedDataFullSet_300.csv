t3_uu5woe,"[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.","I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS

t3_v5rvvy,[Need Advice] What do you do when you can't fall asleep but have to wake up early?,"Here I am, after 4 hours of trying to sleep when my body said no. It's almost 4AM and I have to wake up at 7AM in 3 hours. I don't know what to do. How to fall asleep. Why. What should I do??","My time to shine. Insomnia since age 9, been on prescription sleeping meds that mostly do the trick now. But, for short term solutions or when my meds aren’t kicking in:
The podcast “sleep with me” is great, literally bores you to sleep with mindless rambling. Or, the podcast “stuff you should know”, and pick a boring topic. And I’d echo the first comment about elevating your legs, even a pillow under the knees. Sometimes when I can’t sleep I try to sleep on the couch, are you able to change your scenery? Sometimes even the floor with pillows is weirdly enough to reset my brain. Another trick I use is to close your eyes and start planning something very far in the future that is non-consequential. Like your wedding day or exactly how you’d lay out a castle if you lived in it. Or, get out of bed and start reading a dry book, realize how tired you are, and get back in bed lol. Follow along to a 5 minute deep breathing video on the floor. An app I like that is very calming is called Monument- a simple puzzle game that has lovely music and colors. Lastly, everybody is human and sometimes rescheduling your morning event is the best thing- people will probably understand. Have some tools in your pocket next time it happens!

Edit: monument valley* is the app",Oh my god... his ww1 mustard gas segment scarred me. I would not want to dream listening to that
t3_p07p49,[Need Advice] How to stop worrying about whether I am intelligent enough to pursue something and just do it?,"I’ve been struggling with this for a while now. I’m reaching the stage in my life where I am figuring out what I will be doing with my life, but I struggle to commit to things because I am constantly worried that if I fail, I will have to admit that I am not smart enough.

I want to be able to learn all the things that interest me, but I constantly doubt myself and feel like I may not be good enough. This has led me to limit myself and doubt every decision I make.  I know it’s an immature and damaging mindset to have but I haven’t been able to get rid of it because I am worried that I’ll feel like I wasted my life if I don’t prove to myself that I can excel at what I put my mind to. 

Edit: To add onto this a little more, I feel like I am constantly trying to prove to myself that I am intelligent, self aware etc, but then when I can’t do something or figure something out right away, I use it as a way to put myself down and say to myself, “see, you can’t be successful or knowledgeable because you couldn’t do this thing that other people can do easily” 

All advice is appreciated.

Edit: Id like to thank everyone for their comments and advice. There’s been a lot of helpful advice that I hope I can use to change my mindset and better myself",The best advice I've ever been given is that somebody stupider than you is doing what you wish you were doing.,"This is so simple but it helps me so much. 

Stop every thought, movement and word coming from your mouth. Essentially freeze.

When you’re ready, say this out loud. 3……. 2………. 1………… GO!

If it’s really hard start from 5. But silence absolutely everything. The thing you need to do the most will still be at the front of your mind. When you say go, and make the first gesture to move, your body starts doing the most important task on your list. Trust yourself."
t3_vyhoxf,[Need advice] I'm a 26 year old failure and I don't know what to do anymore.,"I'm 26 years old and I am a failure who is completely useless to society. What should I do?

I'm a stereotype loser. I'm 26. I still live with my parents. I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. 

It's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. 

I have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. 

How can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.

Edit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted. There are a lot of people who posted really thoughtful things and I appreciate that.","26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.

Life is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.

Figure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be ""to travel the world"" or ""to buy a house"" or ""get married and raise a family"" or as simple as ""get a job that lets you live comfortably"". Figure out what it is.

Consistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.

Break down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. 

The secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.

And if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer.

t3_oexyx3,[need advice] how do you force yourself to wake up early without feeling miserable,"I’ve always been a night owl for as long as I can remember. I love staying awake at night, and I naturally tend to fall asleep around 2 to 3 AM and wake up around 10-11AM feeling well-rested. But lately I’ve really had a desire to try to become a morning person so that I can be more productive throughout the day. Do you guys have any tips on how you wake up early, like 6 AM? How do you force yourself out of bed when all you feel like doing is sleeping for “five more minutes.”

Edit: just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to contribute such helpful comments! I may not be able to comment on each individual post, but I will try to read as many tips as I can and incorporate them. I hope others find these tips just as helpful as I did :)","I’m the same as you. I used to spend the whole night scrolling the internet, binge watching, buying useless stuff, whatever. Waking up at 1pm easily. Over the past year I’ve decided to get my life in order. Didn’t especially focus on my sleep schedule issues, but on my general well being. I listen to my body more, I rest more and quit drinking, I take the time to do painting / drawing, whatever creative activity calms me down. Cut out all social media except for Reddit sometimes, never at night. I started feeling more relaxed in the evenings, and I came to enjoy reading a book at 10pm as much as I used to enjoy binge watching Netflix all night. Being far from screens, I get tired, I fall asleep. Naturally, I wake up earlier and earlier every week, step by step. 

My point is, I’ve used every technic I could find to become a morning person before, and it never worked (I was late EVERY day to my job for 4 years). It is only when I started taking care of myself globally and on a more spiritual level too that it has changed. Feeling good and proud about yourself is the best way to actually want to get out of bed and face the day.","* A normal sleep schedule
* An accountability partner getting me to follow said schedule, who also is my partner
* A happier partner
* More time do to the fun stuff with said partner
* Nice breakfasts together
* Two squabbles less

This feeling is so damn strong that no amount of motivation or willpower to persist is working with me

t3_pr596o,[Need Advice] I have the most important exam in my life in a few days and I am too scared to prepare,"I am just so overwhelmed I can’t study/write the paper. I am freaking out and am self sabotaging. I feel like I need someone to hold my hand and help me focus but I am an adult. Can’t find the courage and can only focus for 25min before panicking again. I am already so late. 
If I would write the paper I think I’d be fine and pass it. But I am wasting time for weeks now

I do so bad under pressure. Through university my fear got so bad. It’s the last exam of my life. It counts the most.

Do you have any mindsets or techniques that help ?

Edit: Rn I am productive again. But working really slow. I already read all your input and it has helped. I’ll reply later!

Update: Hey guys! I did it! I worked through three nights, didn’t get nearly any sleep and still went to work only to continue to prepare. I PASSED and I did much better than I thought I would! Now my marks have improved slightly and I never ever need to go through this shit again. Omg. It feels like starting a new life honestly. 

I wanted to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. I came back to this post when the panic came back and every tip I read helped me to focus. I am saving this post to revisit it and I hope this collection of great thoughts will help others too! 💛","I will give you my advice, but I think I should provide some context to help you decide what is it worth.

I am a doctor currently finishing a dual specialisation in two specialities, one in pathology and one in clinical medicine. I have had to sit a LOT of exams, some of which were among the most stressful and intense experiences of my life. I would have similar anxiety spirals in the lead up to them. Exams are stressful.

Before each exam, or during each storm of panic, the single most helpful thing I did was breathe. Sit up straight at your desk, close your eyes, and breathe in deeply, hold it for a few seconds, and then out. Google “box breathing” for more detailed techniques. It is amazing how much the simple act of breathing can pull you out of your thoughts, reaffirm you are alive, and that it will all be ok.

The second most important thing to do is take small steps. Set yourself small, achievable goals. Write a paragraph, or read some text, then break for 5 minutes and have a cup of tea, or some other small, easy reward. Lengthen the amount of time you spend working until you find your mind drifting, then another small break. Small breaks are ok, and essential to remaining productive over a whole session. I do 50 minute sessions, 10 minute breaks, but find the mix that is right for you. If you can only do 25 minutes, that is ok. 25min is > 0 min.

&#x200B;

Finally, beware the mental trap of exams. Exams trick you into thinking they are the most important event in your life, and are linked to your worth as a person/student/academic/whatever. They are neither. They are simply another small hurdle in  a very long journey getting you where you want to be.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, but regardless, good luck.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Breathe, small increments, take the long view.

t3_zz45ua,"[Need Advice] Anyone else start something, become obsessed with it for a while, then lose interest and stop doing it?","This happens to me all the time. It's like I jump from one interest to another. I wanted to learn drums a few months ago and now I'm all about learning to dance. I'm watching tutorials on YouTube and teaching myself some moves but I'm worried if I'll keep this up. I'm worried I'll lose interest either when I find something new or when this gets too hard.

t3_ste3n5,"[need advice] Procrastination on literally everything, even the things i like, i ruining my life","So i more and more notice how bad i actually procrastinate. But it is not just the things i don‘t like doing like studying etc. its also things i really enjoy or that are completely normal to do. I procrastinate on things like getting out of my bed, brushing teeth, going down to drink something, laying in another position when watching a video in bed(actually true :/ ) drawing(which i actually really enjoy doing), walking 3 steps to get lip balm even when my lips are really hurting, sports and so much more. I Basically procrastinate every single thing. And it’s not like im on my phone all the time(well most of the time) but i also procrastinate while doing nothing. And it isn‘t like an „out of sight out of mind“ type more like not doing but really wanting to do it, i feel really really shitty while procrastinating because all im thinking about is what i should be doing right now. This sometimes goes so far that i actually dont sleep at night, i can procrastinate for hours at night watching stupid youtube videos while feeling sick about myself. Then suddenly its 4 at night and i didn‘t do shit, so i tell myself it’s too late now and i basically wasted all that time for nothing at all. My grades are failing hard, i may have to attend this year again and i would have to leave all my friends behind.

I really don‘t know what to do anymore, i managed to read some books like Atomic Habits but i didn‘t do any of the methods. I used to have really good grades when i didn’t need to study as much and i also know that if i just study a can get excelent results but i just don‘t do it. Also if i start i have like an 10 minute motivation boost till i fall back into a depressive state of procrastination. I don‘t know if its adhd or something(ADHD is running in my Family like crazy, my dad is in early retirement because of it, and my brother who was diagnosed as well also has similar problems)

I just feel like im fucking my entire life up because i achive little to nothing every day. Everytime i go to bed i feel like i wasted this day once again.

(Sorry for bad spelling im typing this on my phone and english is my second language)","Same. And I haven't found any way or method that universally, always helps me cope better with this. In a way that makes sense - to be human means to operate in changeable situations, and to not always do what should be done. So the solutions are also going to look different day-to-day and sometimes they won't work. The key thing is to try different stuff, to have lots of different ""tools"" to try in this situation, but even that will not always work. One of the most difficult hurdles is using a tool in the first place, just as you articulate. But, I believe you can do it at least some of the time! I believe you can develop some tools for moment-to-moment use. And hopefully you can find something to help longer-term too (I agree that depression and ADHD are possible underlying things that are happening here).

Some things that help me, to give you an example of what I mean by ""tools"":

-Lots of forgiveness. Actively speaking to myself in a kind, forgiving, compassionate way. It's important because forgiveness clears my energy and creates security in myself, which encourages me to risk trying things that might not work. Plus kindness is the nice thing to do. It's soothing. It's a way to parent myself through difficult feelings. If I do want to be mean to myself, I try to at least do it in a joking or ironic way to make myself laugh in the process. Laughter makes things seem less serious. But generally, I assume if I can't do a task that it means I am feeling vulnerable in some way and need soothing and compassion. I could speak to myself kindly or ask someone else for a hug or something like that.

-Deciding a first action, setting a 5 minute timer, then acting once the timer goes off. It's like that ""countdown"" technique people use to get themselves moving, but with a longer range, to give the subconscious mind time to adjust to the idea. One reason to procrastinate can be a struggle with making transitions between different activities (changing from activity A to activity B). Giving myself a slower pace of change can help me with transitions sometimes at least. And making the signal external to me reduces the work my mind has to do. Often I am thinking ""do it now!"" and I don't act, in fact I feel I can't. But sometimes when the timer goes off 5 minutes after I decided my action, I can act. If not, I can set the timer 1-2 more times to see if it works then. If not, only 15 minutes have elapsed and I know that I tried to find a way out of being trapped and that because this didn't work, I can see that the problem is not going to be easily solved this time.

-""Wiggle your big toe"". It's a scene in the film Kill Bill where the character must get her legs to work, so she starts with intensive focus on one toe. Can't do a big movement like turning your whole body or sitting up? Try a small one.

-Promise myself a reward and then give it to myself once I have done something. Even something small like putting on the lip balm could count if it's something difficult for you and if thinking about a reward for doing it helps you actually do it. Don't judge what you consider a reward, figure it out and accept it and work with it. (I am food motivated. I loathe the idea of leaving the house as a reward because it feels like a task in itself.)

-Physically changing my location/movements while keeping my mind blank. Don't know why this works, but it does sometimes help me. For example, I was standing up staring down at a whiteboard, trying to get motivation to clean it so I could use it. But I just felt dread and reluctance. Then I made my mind blank, and just sat down next to the whiteboard, only seeing it through my peripheral vision. Pretty quickly, I felt a change internally. Suddenly the task felt doable and I got up and got going with it, no internal ""forcing"" necessary. If I need to clean, making my body just mindlessly pick things up and put them other places can actually get me into the right frame of mind to genuinely start cleaning. It's like, if figuring things out mentally isn't helping, then engage the body first!

-Try and really dissect certain situations for what is creating discomfort, reluctance or dread. This might be extremely difficult (it is for me), so it's not somethingto push - but gently be aware of. For example, I realised I often don't leave bed because I dread being cold. It took me a long time to recognise that, even though it is simple. Judging that doesn't help me - wrapping up warmer while in bed in preparation to leave does. Underlying reasons can be much less obviously connected to problems, though. My therapist guided me through a decision making technique and it starts with ""feel and acknowledge"". Before deciding what you should do, perhaps try to understand yourself in that moment? Only after doing that can you negotiate between your wants and your needs. One way to cultivate awareness of this is to ask yourself whether anything negative has happened recently, that might be affecting your mood, energy or concentration in general. Because those things affect the decisions you make, if you are struggling in the afternoon and in the morning you argued with someone, the struggle might have little to do with the task and everything to do with the argument. Finally, deeper things like fears and insecurities can prevent action - in this case you cannot brute force a solution, but need a gentle set of steps to follow, or an alternative way of looking at the task so that it doesn't feel so scary and important.

-That brings me to ask whether you have received any external support recently? It seems like some of the problems here are self-sustaining in the sense that you feel behind and unable to catch up, which would increase your worries and stresses, which would decrease what you can cope with. Perhaps someone else can help you see the situation in a different light that seems more manageable, could get you some supports so you're not facing it alone? 

These things listed above are just possibilities. And, I am sorry I added much of my own experience - you are your own person and solutions will come from you, not from others. But I do know what it's like to go through this. I hope this post helps you a bit. Please let me know whether anything I said was unclear.","Also, it may not be ADHD, there could just be some issue with executive dysfunction (you can't connect wanting to do a thing, with actually doing the thing)."

t3_10ntzgh,How to stop imagining conversations? [Need Advice],"I obsessively envision conversations in my head where someone says something rude/demeaning to me and I make a good comeback. I suspect this has something to do with me being a pushover with terribly low self esteem but I’m fed up with it being the only thing I can think about, a lot of the time I don’t even realise it until I’m mid-thought.

It’s easy to say ‘stop imagining it’ but when it’s your only source of confidence, the ability to just ‘stop’ vanishes.
It’s also easy to say don’t be a pushover but I’m very scared of people (tfw bad childhood full of screaming parents) and I don’t know how to get a backbone.

How can I stop? This started a few years ago and it’s plagued my life since. Some extra information, I’m turning 19 this year, I’m neurotypical (I was evaluated in 2021 because I can’t make friends, but turns out I’m just a weirdo from a bad family), and I’ve been trying to stop this for years now but it feels impossible, I give in every time because it actually makes me feel good about myself.

I don't know what to do with this feeling it's so unmotivating, it's not how I expected to feel at all. It honestly makes me want to drink.

So I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this, and how they approached it. (I'm 28F btw, if that matters)","Probably because you’re doing what you think you should than what you truly wish to do 

You say you discovered what you wanted to do but is it truly what you want to do? Are you using societies expectations to find a path which is acceptable to it’s metric. 


You said you got into reading, exercising and studied. All of these are fantastic but they’re also the cookie cutter approach of being productive, rounded and living a balanced lifestyle. 

Is it true to you is the question? I’m not saying give up reading or exercising. What I’m saying is, you need to find your bliss not what you think will bring you bliss.

Which also isn’t the drinking, smoking or dead end jobs.

The thoughts/opinions that best define you're character/personality  aren't your very first thoughts on a subject, but your second ones.

The first opinions that come to your mind are usually snap judgements that involve little thought and so they tend to reflect close associations your brain has made, aka biases(even if they might not be logical), and so they are mostly determined by the environment you were raised in.

On the other hand, the second opinions you form about a subject require you to put in some more thought into it, which forces you to be more rational in your judgement, because you can apply you're reasoning skills now.

Therefore, your second thoughts on a subject are a much better reflection of character because they reveal how rational you are, and how much you let your own biases influence you.

If you are already recognizing that you're initial reactions around poc are irrational and caused by your personal bias against them, then you are already going in the right direction.

Good luck with your problem, and remember, everyone has their own biases, what's important is that you don't let them override your reason. Biases are just mental hurdles meant to be overcome.","I had to tell my ex to STOP visiting horrible sites that were so anti-women, red-Pill-ish in nature.

t3_t207sh,"[Need Advice] My wife divorced me because of my porn addiction, PIED and depression. I need your help."," Hello there,

Threw away account. If I'm posting in the wrong sub please guide me where to post it.I live in a big mess now. There are many things in my life that needs my attention. I want to tell my story which I hesitated many times to write.

As I said I'm a 40 years old man. I got married 7 years ago from the kindest and most beautiful woman I ever saw. I never had any relations before marriage. Just after marriage, I discovered that I have erectile dysfunction. No body knows why. I'm on the overweight side so Endocrinologists said that I need to loose weight to optimize my hormonal profile. My psychiatrists talked about watching porn and porn induced erectile dysfunction. Urologists don't have answers, for them I should proceed for implant surgery which other doctors are refusing since I'm not completely flaccid. Not before I solve my porn addiction and overweight problem.

I tried hard loosing weight staying away from porn but everytime I fail, I get depressed and I become worse than before. I know some people my consider this nonesense but I always had problems with my self confidence and social anxiety. That was the final blow. Eventually my wife left me. that was 1 year ago. My depression starting reflecting on my behaviuor with her. I started treating her badly but i never hit her before you jump to conclusions. Although by the time she left me, I already had started seeing psychiatrists but she couldn't take it anymore. I love her so much. I want her back. She never did me any harm and I treated her badly. I want to fix myself but I don't know if I can do it or no.

I need to become athletic to correct all my hormones which I never did in my life even as a kid I wasn't active. I was a bookworm then a geek but never an active person. I need to stop watching porn which is the only thing now that gives me any kind of joy. I want to loose weight which increased dramatically since she left me. I need to take my medications again. After this I need to have the courage to accept that i may need a surgery after all this effort.

I live alone in another country that my motherland. I have a successful career in this country. Although I'm not happy with it and every day I think about quitting and returning home but I try to do my best since it's the only thing left. No body of my colleagues understands what i'm going through. No body will even if I told them. Multiple nationalities working togehter so it's not the mosr friendly atmosphere. My psychiatrist is saying that quitting my job will be like committing suicide. I live alone. No family, no relatives nearby and only two friends that I'm very ashamed to tell them the truth. Even if I tell them, each has his own world and problems nowadays.

I need to be able to cook myself daily healthy meals. I need to exercise, loose weight and become a real athletic. I need to clean the house. Since my depression worsened my personal hygiene level has detriorated dramatically. I need also to study hard for an exam that I've been failing each year for the last 3 years. I need to quit watching porn. I need to quit staying glued to my phone screen for long hours. The older I get, the harder it gets to achieve anything.My work routine isn't regular which is another problem. I wake up at 5:30 am everyday. sometimes I go home by 3:00 pm, sometimes 7:00 pm and sometimes I spend a full 24 hours working (really 24h). No rules.

I don't know what I'm asking for. Am I searching for motivation? Or searching for someone to tell me that's impossible and stop trying. am i just venting, I don't know. All I know that reddit helped me several times in different situatiuons. I need your help again.","Your situation is not impossible and in a years time you can be a totally different, happier, healthier, better version of yourself.

Firstly I think it’s important to acknowledge you may never get your wife back. And I think trying to make these changes as a means of getting her back is a complete waste of time. Not only does this disrespect her autonomy, but you may not deserve to have her forgiveness based on the way you’ve treated her. 

I would look at this as a journey to self actualization; and if there are good things that come of it then great. It took your wife leaving and you being SO unhappy that you have to make a change. Please don’t think that this level of motivation is going to exist forever.

To be quite frank I would be surprised if you were able to do this on your own. I certainly wouldn’t try as my first option.

t3_w8lmqp,[Need advice] How to clean my house properly and keep it clean all the time?,"This is embarrassing tbh because it’s considered to be an easy task for most people. I (29F) have always neglected my house. It looks like pile of trash and clothes everywhere. I’ve tried to see YouTube videos, googled etc, but I just can’t clean properly. I don’t know why I’m like this. I can’t even have guests. I can’t understand why I’m like this.

I know people think I’m just lazy but I’m not. I work, study and take long hikes very often. It’s difficult to describe the feeling I get when I think about cleaning my home. I feel defeated.","You're like that because no one has taught you how to clean. We aren't born knowing how to be tidy, we have to learn, so that's not your fault at all.

To get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it's really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash? You can start by sorting laundry into one place (can be a big corner pile even) to do a load a day until it's done, and a bag of trash on a timer a day. It didn't get messy all in one day, so you won't get it clean that fast either. But by taking small steps it can get better faster than you think.

t3_uvlurd,I'm so tired of procrastination and feeling like shit [Discussion] [Need Advice],"So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.

&#x200B;

Edit: I will go into further details in this edit.

Some comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.

I stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.

Other than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.

I believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.

Between ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.

I genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.

I must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.

Unlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.","What you need are two things:

1) A mentor. 

Anyone who you can trust that can support you and help you to develop the skills you need to be able to be more productive and achieve your goals. This person can help you by giving you advice, helping you train, support you when you fail or provide the kind of influence you need to reach the level of success your mind is pushing you towards. 

2) Habits:

You need to develop habits that will propel you into the future and towards your inner self's level of expected success. Habits are best defined as small repetitive steps that lead towards an expected outcome. They are easy to start and over time, become engrained into your daily ritual to the point of subconsciousness. 

Break the mindset that your path to success is A to B. It's really A to Z. Start small. Start with easy changes that do not require a lot of effort or change who you are overnight. Build from there. Find the inner developmental triggers that work for you by expirimenting and learning about who you are as an individual. This skill will help you to direct yourself towards change and ultimately, success. 

Understand the value in trial and error. Failure is a gift that leads to success. 

You can do this. You have the fire within you. Remember, the longest journey starts with a single step.","Yes yes yes! I’ve always been a serial procrastinator. I’ve spent my 20’s trying out different methods, and asking others for their strategies that help. I’ve found some that work well for me, and some that haven’t. That’s ok, and I can’t expect it to suddenly change overnight. It’s something I will continue to work on and test. 

I break tasks into teeny tiny chunks (as small as you can go!) so you only commit to a little thing (much easier than a huge task!), get it done quickly and feel good about yourself and your achievements (which motivates you to do more)
I also love lists. Bright, colourful ones that look fun to me, and I can colour in tick boxes, or fill up a barometer (to track my progress and watch my successes add up)
False deadlines with accountability’s key for me. I tell my friend or family ‘I need to finish this task by this date, and I can do *this* as a reward’. Those people often don’t even need to check in on me, but the accountability to another is far more powerful than to myself. 
I also set timelines. “This research needs to be done by 10:00 on Tuesday. This paragraph needs to be done by 12:00 on Wednesday” etc. 

Keep googling, keep asking others, and start finding out your techniques to side step procrastination 👍 good luck"

Has anyone else had this experience? ","Yes and no.

When I’m travelling, especially when stuck driving for long hours or the entire day just to get somewhere, all my brain can think about is What We *Could* Be Doing If We Were At Home. 

If I dwell on that, it’s overwhelming and ruins the entire trip. 

So, I try and utilise my notes app on my phone, and all of these Things That I Could Be Doing I write down and assure myself we will go over them when we get home (by “we” I mean myself and the urge to do these things lol). 

Whenever I get home, I first have to deal with massive waves of intense aggression and frustration. I’ve been like this since I can remember, only difference now is I have tools to help vent the frustration instead of just blowing up at everyone. 

But I also utilise this Frustration Time to my advantage — I open up my computer and set up my To Do word document, and get my phone out and set it up so I can type up things from the notes app straight into my computer. Then, when I’m pacing around hunting for something to do to calm me, everything is already set up to go on my desk. 

So I make it as inviting as possible to just sit down and start typing up these notes of All The Things I wanted to do. 

After awhile of typing up, and seeing how many of the things I wrote in the notes while I was travelling *were already written down on my computer ages ago and forgotten about*, the problem solving gears start ticking in my brain, and I start looking for which of these To Dos I can cross off **today**. 
Before long I’ve just spent several hours working on a To Do plan and my brain is in overdrive thinking about how it can achieve those things. Then it’s just a matter of actually getting up, and like with the computer and the notes - setting up a task so that everything is ready to just *go*. 
You need to tidy that bookshelf? Pull everything off the bookshelf onto the floor. Organize the books from the decorations from the video games. Now you’re already halfway there and your brain is probably already getting excited thinking about how it can better arrange the bookcase.

t3_u0cll8,[Need Advice] How do you deal with multiple interests and lack of discipline to commit to any one?,"I am a generalist and passionate about manyyy things. But this serves as a disadvantage (IMO) because to succeed, you have to be consistent and focus on one particular thing. You only have time to do so many things in life. But I am having a hard time narrowing my interests down to a single thing. If I pursue one of my interests, I feed bad for not doing something else. And also get bored if I keep doing the same thing over and over. I thrive on novelty and in this case, I love the novelty of learning something new. 

This is a typical cycle for me. I usually start off by doing something novel, put all my effort into learning the basics, get to a saturation point, and then I either get bored or feel bad for not pursuing my other interests (or sometimes both) and end up giving up on what I was doing. And this cycle keeps repeating. And to be clear, I am equally passionate about all of my interests. These are not hobbies, these are interests that I would potentially consider taking up as careers.

Update: Thank you for insightful comments and great recommendations! I am super grateful for the effort that you guys have put in your replies. I’ve learnt new perspectives from every single comment. This is awesome. Thank you once again 🥰

To summarize 

1) Go on dopamine fasting. Rewire my brain to get used to lower doses of dopamine hit. Swear off social media

2) Replace downtime with something constructive, that I can grow over time. Be deliberate about what the replacement activities are before going on dopamine fast. Examples of replacement activities are reading, journaling, exercising, learning a new language, trying to make art…

3) Examine what is causing me to get into social media apps, beyond the dopamine factor. Social media is not my support network. Few books mentioned are Wilpower instinct, Atomic habits, Digital Minimization, the Molecule of more 

4) Out of sight out of mind. Keep the phone away, set limits on usage, put on grey mode, tell my brain that I am not missing out anything. Love this quote ""If it's not what you want, are you really sacrificing anything by not doing it?""","It is called Revenge Procrastination. Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.","I’m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary ‘A Social Dilemma’. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. 

Here’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:


“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.

This feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”

Link: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/

There’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. 

As always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!"
t3_xe53ud,"[Need Advice] How to stop being extremely lazy and day dreaming, and instead focus on learning?","Hello, I am easily distracted in school. I am extremely lazy and would often day dream but I am extremely lazy.

I have short-sightedness and would just use it as an excuse to not focus, but here's the thing. 

I would write down what I heard and google it, even when my vision is blurry.

EXCEPT I STOPPED DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M REALLY LAZY, HOW DO I DEAL WITH MYSELF?","Since no one else is giving you serious advice… Learning is just like any good habit and it takes time to build good habits.  You need to force yourself to do things you don’t enjoy because you know that its for your own benefit anyway.

Force yourself to study for 10-15 minutes at a time.  Do this multiple times a day, whether you feel like it or not.

Soon the habit of studying starts to form and then you will be studying more often and it won’t seem so unpleasant after a while.

But this doesn’t happen overnight.  Building habits take time.","I'd recommend using a pomodoro timer! 25 minutes on, 5 min break."
t3_xjcny2,"[Need Advice] I Tried Everything, but Nothing Works. I Don't Know What to Do Any More.","Hello, I'm Male 19. I'm studying in college and I'm currently in my third semester. My exams are about to start in the second week of October and I haven't studied anything yet. Due to college being lenient on attendance, I didn't attend much lectures because of my social anxiety. I'm feeling all over the place right now.

I tried to make a schedule multiple times and stick to it, but my attempts were unsuccessful due to procrastination as well as poor time management skills, I always end up feeling overwhelmed.

Being a dopamine addict doesn't help either. I always prioritize instant gratification over my long-term goals. I'm addicted to smartphone, specifically social media like YouTube and Reddit. My screen time is 8-10 hours. I'm addicted to masturbation too.

I don't feel motivated at all. I mean obviously how I'll feel motivated when I keep overstimulating my brain with useless shit. Still, I tried. I even started seeing a therapist since the month of July for my stress, anxiety and depression, but I'm seeing no improvements so far.

I fucking hate myself. Thinking about all the time I've wasted and all the time I'm wasting right now as well as thinking about what if I was self-disciplined and how successful I would've been makes me feel like a total piece of shit. I wish I could run far away from all of my problems and disappear from this world peacefully.

What should I do? Please help me, I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed right now. Thank you.","Ok bro you are me but I’m 32, this is probably going to be a lifelong quest for you to stay motivated and productive, but if you START learning how to do it now it will pay off so much bigger. I started when I was 26 and I am a very happy individual for the most part and learned how to be productive in my own way. If I started at 19 would be in an even better position than I am now. 

First thing though you can’t fucking HATE yourself over it, that doesn’t actually help. It’s super emotional and it doesn’t get you anywhere, it just makes you sad and emotional which triggers your brain to look for comfort, which in your case is just more procrastination. You want to be unemotional, scientific and make BABY STEPS. 

If I was gonna give you any advice it’s don’t swing for the fucking fences, take baby steps, make small improvements every day they add up huge.

Don’t study for 6 hours straight “tomorrow,” study for 5 minute right this second. If you have a fitness goal, don’t wait until tomorrow where you will eat perfectly clean and start the most beautiful diet. Eat a salad today, or just don’t drink one soda.

Go very slow, progress takes time, stay calm you are going to have to make mistakes to learn, don’t get mad at yourself for mistakes. 

If you have something that you need a professional for like adhd or depression, go make that appointment and make baby steps on that too",24 and agree this is what i had to work on
t3_r7wiiv,[Need Advice] I am 22(F). Never had an exercise routine. I am overweight and mentally ill. Please help.,"I tried to have a routine for my whole life, but in vain. But I wanna let go of all excuses and start new with your advice. Please help me. I am good at skipping, I am flexible (did a Yoga class years ago, I was good at it).

Edit: You guys.... I am so very grateful to y'all. I started walking towards my goal today, literally. I'll be forever grateful to you ❤️","The easiest way to build a habit is to attach new behavior to an existing habit.

For example, if you want to start flossing, just put your floss next to your toothbrush so you remember to floss whenever you brush your teeth.

In your case if you want to build an exercise routine, I'd suggest start small and just find a good time to do some walking.

Watch YouTube a lot? Try to make it a habit that you only watch videos while you're walking.

Maybe put your shoes in front of your fridge so every time you go to get dinner, you remember to go on a walk afterwards.

Be creative - find a habit you can build off of and take advantage. Walking outdoors is a great way to improve mental health as well.",I always thought it was keep it simple stupid. Learnt something new.
t3_seqz08,[Need Advice] How do I stop procrastinating and actually start doing things?,"Hi everyone, looking for some tips. I’ll start out by being open and honest, I’m inherently lazy. I really wish I wasn’t. I go to sleep every night with the best intentions of waking up at 6am, going to the gym and having a really productive day, however it never pans out that way and I manage to put all of these things off and decide it’s too late. I was wondering what tips and tricks do you guys all have to motivate yourselves and really make the most of a day? Thanks in advance guys!

EDIT: Thank you all so so much for the advice, it’s nice to know that there’s so many people that are willing to offer up advice and even show a little bit of belief in me. It helps more than you could ever even imagine :)",I am a major procrastinator.  The thing that helps me the most is realizing that when I procrastinate I have this false assumption that the future me will be more motivated and capable to complete whatever I am putting off. That is just false.  Now I just assume future me is the biggest fuck off ever and will screw me over and disappoint me.  Doing this changes my mind set enough to either I do it now or it won't get done.  I still procrastinate but I feel the costs sooner and am more likely to do stuff.,"i'm in the same boat. probably the best tip I have is to force yourself a little bit. it's 11pm right now, I'll go to sleep right after I study maths a bit. wake up at 6:30. in the beginning, it wasn't easy. it's winter, and the morning sucks. force yourself to wake up early. just do one thing at a time.

read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/). read it until you memorise everything ryan said. I've read it tens of times in the last few years and still read it every once in a while. it's a great post. learn to forgive yourself. and really live by the idea of having non zero days. above I said i'd sleep after I study maths for a bit. that bit is only 2 minutes for me. I've been doing this for at least two weeks now? yeah, it took me a long time to actually start doing things.

that's why I linked the post. because you gotta learn to forgive yourself. it's okay you're procrastinating right now. and it's okay you'll procrastinate tomorrow too. but do a little everyday. you have a limited amount of willpower, and that's okay. 5 minutes is all you got, that's okay. 

you can't be productive everyday, at least in the beginning. set the bar low, and do it everyday. I've come to a point now where I don't break the chain. i do everything I planned, even if its for a moment. saves me from feeling guilty.

it'll create a habit soon and everything will become easy. if you're like me, just try the pomodoro method. find your perfect setting. for me, right now, it's 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of study. and that chances very often. i just force myself to work 25 minutes and enjoy a 5 minute break. sometimes 5 minutes turn to 10 or 15. but that's okay. i worked for 25 minutes and it's already a non zero day, okay? i worked 3.5 hours today, and procrastinated a lot too. but I felt good about working that much. 

I'm still not doing my best. but at least I don't hate myself for it. I'm trying, and that's enough. i don't need to be productive all the time, I just need to be productive for a minute."
t3_w15zh2,[Need Advice] Forming the habit of working out at 5am,"I have picked up two habits since last year, flossing daily and cold showers daily. However I just can’t seem to make the habit of working out at 5am stick. I’ve seen how completing the 5am workouts has given me more energy throughout the day and also made me more conscious about my food choices. I want to make this a habit. 
I am a morning person so no problem waking up at 5am but I do find myself gravitating towards work rather than working out. 

Appreciate your advice!","1. Alarm rings
2. Get up within 30 seconds
3. Pee/poop
4. Drink some water
5. Put on workout clothes
6. Work out (or drive to gym)

At no point do you look at your phone, have breakfast, turn on the TV or anything else. You do everything above in order, no exception. You cannot give yourself even a moment's pause where you can think ""Oh, lemme just check reddit first, I'll work out in 20 minutes..."" Because then you won't work out. It needs to become automatic. Alarm rings = immediate workout.",I switch the water and bathroom time. Down a nice tall glass of cold water (a bit more than it feels like is necessary). Wakes you up like a cup of tea!
t3_sg8l1i,"[Need Advice] Can't sit down to do something for 15 minutes. Not the hobbies that I like, and not my tasks","I do a multitude of things. I write, read, draw, make music, design book covers, learn languages and lately picked up (and dropped) chess. I even liked studying because I loved my field. 

I just can't seem to tolerate the actual process of sitting down and engaging in any of them anymore. I really want to but I can't stand it. I can't write anything, can't draw, can't study--can't stand doing anything persistantly for more than 10 to 15 minutes. I get stressed out and anxious pretty easily and quickly switch to something else to detach my mind. 


On the rare occasions I sit down and really get sucked into something I *can* actually go for hours on end. If I can somehow get myself to be like this all the time, I'd be killing it rn. But it feels like there's a block in my mind stopping me, like a writer's block or an art block, except for my mind as a whole. Cheesy analogy, I know. 


Thought maybe adhd for a while but I dropped that suspicion. Can't say if I've always been like this. This either started or became noticeably bad enough at the beginning of last year/late 2020. Can't say much about my childhood since i don't remember much anyways beside just being a lonely weirdo. 


Personal life aside, my greatest concern rn is my tilting academics. I know what I need to do, I can hash out a good plan to do it, I want to do it, I know I can if I can bring myself to it. But I just can't. Can't start, can't keep going. Some days I'm moderately motivated, others I'm detached. Either way I'm doing nothing. Semester started about six weeks ago, I'm quickly falling behind. My mind, body and heart are refusing to cooperate. 


Can't afford time and money for therapists atm. If anyone has any tips on how to manage this on my own and combat this behaviourally/mentally please share


EDIT: I'd like to emphasize that I do not believe I have had this issue further back than 2021 or 2020. I'm turning 23. This is fairly recent. I relate to r/adhd but it's hard to distinguish adhd from chronic stress for example. The symptoms are similar, the actual culprit is hard to pin point. So I don't think specifically assuming adhd out of a whole bunch is wise, and I'm trying not to carry it anymore 

Either way I'm looking for practical tips that don't involve me going to a therapist because there are literally none around me and if I find one I can't afford seeing them or the meds (bc, developing country w civil unrest rn)","Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help","Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'"
t3_rzso87,[Need Advice] Discipline is constant work,"I'm just putting it up here to remind me. (27F)

1. You don't always get to dk what you want. You need to do it.
2. Nothing wrong with doing things the proper easy way.
3. Get used to discipline now, and it will be easier to keep doing it in the future. 
4. Get a therapist in the future. I learnt a lot of coping skills on my own, and they were not the best. I unlearn some things I got from going up, my parents didn't really know how to help.
5. Start contributing to society!
6. Habits. Start small. Then get bigger.
7. If you need to cry, then cry.","One thing I've noticed is such a pro of being disciplined. It gives you absolute freedom. For example there was a day I was very disciplined, and the next day I slacked a bit on the timing of my meals and sleep. Felt like shit the next day but that's when I realized being disciplined allows me to do what I want day to day, as well as achieving dreams.","one more thing, everybody starts from somewhere"
t3_xu29aj,"[Need advice] Is there an age when you need to stop being a jack-of-all-trades, master of none?","I'm 24. I graduated from a Big Ten business school with good grades, and I'm now a consultant at a large accounting firm. I work long hours, but I have enough time for hobbies.

Throughout my life, I've had a variety of interests, ranging from football to musical theater to punk rock. I was in band, cross country, track, NHS, and I was involved in church in high school. Basically, I was stretched thin across many activities.

Now, I have less time to stretch across my hobbies. I'm single, and I want to remain single until I have a better idea of who I am and what I'm into.

I've wrestled with the same thing for years.

Plan time during your day for doing nothing or doing anything, scheduled free time. Talk to your subconscious and have a dialogue, tell it you realize why it's happening but this is not the time and plan a time the next day to exercise that control you're lacking.

t3_w61v7w,"[Need Advice] I really want to change, I don't want to live this way anymore.","Hey so, I've been struggling with depression for... Well, honestly my whole life, as well as anxiety. I don't like to think of these as excuses, but I do recognize they can make things difficult for me. I've just also never had self discipline. I don't want to sound snobby, but I've never had to try. I've had at least moderate success in just about everything I've tried, school included, though I've always had good grades. However, I procrastinate everything until the absolute last second, even if I know about it and don't mean to. I always mean to do things, my brain just... Kind of shuts down if I need to do tasks? I'm in therapy and everything, but my change isn't fast enough for me. 

I've always gotten by in school without studying. I just pretty much cram and skim until I find answers, and it's ALWAYS the day of the due date. I literally procrastinated my entire senior year of high school (As in I didn't do any of it) until the final week. And I still PASSED. I think I huge reason why I repeat this behavior is because I still succeed. 

However. I want to get back into reading. I want to start editing videos again. I want to start eating healthier (Right now my main goal is to kick my binge-eating habit). And honestly I want to study. I want to be what I would consider a traditional student. It's just incredibly difficult for me to even do things like showering on time (Gross I know), but I'm just always exhausted, and have never known motivation. There's so many things I want to do, and I keep trying and failing. I need help and I just don't know what to do. 

Thank you if you've read this far, sorry if it's disorganized at all it's past 4am and I haven't been able to sleep (Another thing I want to fix)","Hello! First of all, I'm proud of you for making this far! It is amazing that you have accomplished so much with those two horses dragging you down! Congratulations! Really!

Second of all, asking for help is already another step foward. I also have depression and anxiety and I know how it is to have those blockdowns. That being said, how are you with social media? I found out that, for me, not having a time limit on instagram and tiktok made me scroll aimlessly between them until I feel too guilty to do anything. So what I did is that I put a time-limit on tiktok with a password and my bf set the password up, so I have no clue what it is. You could do something similar if you have someone you trust to set up a password for you. If you don't, you can always put the time limit yourself and it will, at least, make you remember that this is not good for you and you'll probably move on to do something better.

When you are in a low moment of your life and just don't feel like doing nothing, choose a comfort movie for you and watch it. It requires no effort and, in the end, you will be feeling slightly better, maybe better enough to do one small taks like taking the garbage out. And this can become a snowball effect if you are in the mood: ""I already done this, so I can do that other slightly bigger thing now"" and so on.

In therapy, idk about you, but I sometimes hid what I was ashamed of concerning my behaviour so my therapist thought I was getting better. DON'T BE LIKE ME! Tell all the worse and the best things to your therapist!!! Only then change can get to you faster. You need to tell everything.

Concerning the binge-eating, idk who does the shopping at you home, but if it is you, build up the strenght to simply not buy what you binge-eat. You could also try to replace the foods with popcorn (with little butter and a pinch of salt), that is healthier, or buy more fruits and have them already saved on the fridge sliced, so that you can binge eat those. One fruit that helps me a lot (since sometimes I just don't have the energy to slice fruit up) is grapes. I love those green grapes that are ""seedless"" and they only require you wash them before you eat, so I always buy a great amount of them and when I feel the urge to eat something bc I'm anxious I go to the fridge, grab them and there you go, eating but not those muffins I used to eat before. Nuts in general are also a good option, the thing is to control yourself to eat one at a time and not put a handful in your mouth.

And finally, I know how you feel about wanting to do everything all at once and then getting frustrated because you can't. Try this: for this month, I want to get back to reading, so every week from now on I will choose a short story to read. If I manage to do so, I will get a book to read, and I will finish it until the end of the year (remember, set major goals that are volatile and with a large expiration date, only the minor goals within the major ones should be with an expiration date closer to you). To do so, you can say ""I will try to read at least one page before going to bed/after waking up/during lunch"". And you can adapt this scheme to any other goals you might have. Just remember, it is little penguin steps at a time, because if you set a goal that is minor, it is easier to go beyond that and you will feel amazing bc you did more than you have set to do. This won't happen if you set a major goal that is difficult to achieve right away.

(Oh, and one more thing, if you are the competitive type, you can make a competition with yourself, like ""I dare myself to cut this whole watermelon and put it in the fridge before this podcast episode ends"" and  if you don't make it, you at least already started doing it, so you can set another challenge ""I will do this before the sun sets"" or something else you feel appropriate to you)

t3_zalna8,"[Need Advice] - I was a good student and then everything changed with me, I started wasting time, dropped all my productive habits, started porn addiction, missing lectures and tests and basically ruined myself.","It’s been one year since the above mentioned situation is going on. I have numerous times tried to get out of it but just I can’t. I know what to do, but just can’t get on the way of doing it. I have gotten fat, unhealthy, been lying to my parents, watching porn all day. This has been the worst year of my entire life. 
Kindly tell how should I become a good and responsible man from this rock bottom.

My goals are to get regular in studies, stop porn addiction, a start a fitness regime, and also follow some hobbies like reading and learning piano.","I'm currently in a similar situation. Although I can't say ""THIS WORKS"", I can just tell you how I'm about to approach it. I've been consuming productivity advices for about 2 years now, so I might actually put some to action, isn't that true? Well then...

I'm going to start small. E.g. Study for 15 minutes, then take 5 minutes break (basically a less demanding pomodoro method). 

I will block the sites I don't want to visit. Whenever I find myself opening such a site (because bad habits take long to break), I will walk out of the room and get some small exercise in (10 push-ups), while rethinking the whole thing, then hopefully closing that site and doing something that improves me - reading or as I want to get better at drawing, I might do that.

I will create a study plan and print it out, so that I can see it at all times. And stick to it.

I will have my meals planned out for the entire week, so that I can focus on more important stuff. 

I will clear my workplace of any distraction. Environment has huge impact on what I do, after all. I will clear out my room of anything I don't need or can put away = more space, less distraction.

YES, I write this for myself. But it might help other people get some ideas of where to start.

Also, I can recommend reading Atomic Habits by James Clear for further ideas.","Amazing man, at least you’ve started. Definitely I will apply things you’ve stated."

After my GCSE’s, it felt like my ability to stay motivated started declining. I’ve now graduated from university and it’s a struggle to do anything. 

As for background info, I was prescribed antidepressants 4 years ago. Over that time, I’ve tried different types and doses. I think the most recent change was about 2 years ago. My depression has definitely contributed to times of feeling lethargic and demotivated, but lately it feels different.

After graduating last July, I had a few months break before getting a retail job to earn some money. I left at the end of January this year to take the time to apply for a masters course. Any time I felt drained, I assumed it was from being at work a lot or recovering from my retail routine, however, it’s now been months and I’m still struggling. 

I have a lot of hobbies. I get interested in something for a while and then move onto something new. Some stick, a lot don’t. Now, I can’t seem to do any of them. I have dreams and goals, but anything more than getting out of bed feels too difficult. I have a very imaginative mind, but I no longer feel like I have the motivation to put it to use. Occasionally, I’ll have a day where I manage to clean my whole room or go for a run, but soon I go back to how I felt before. Even small attempts to break the cycle don’t seem to work for me. If they do, I eventually go back to struggling with things like putting a sock in a drawer. It makes me angry, frustrated and I feel worthless.

Ordinarily, I find it hard to accept that sometimes my mental health prevents me from doing things. I automatically think I am making excuses and that I’m using my depression as one. I even feel like I’m making my depression up at times and convince myself I am attention seeking. Now, it’s even worse and I can’t stop worrying that I’m using depression as an excuse for plain laziness. I’ve wondered if something like ADHD or bi-polar is responsible, but again, I feel I am looking for a reason to explain ordinary laziness. 

I often see things like ‘don’t demand too much of yourself’ and ‘it’s ok if all you did today was survive’ or ‘you are allowed to take a break’, but I tell myself that these don’t apply to me. I shouldn’t go easy on myself because I have no reason to be like this. I am just lazy and useless and it is my own fault.

I just want to go back to feeling motivated and being productive. Or, at least, I want to feel less guilty about not being able to. I’d love any advice or reassurance - I think it would really help. Thanks :)","What is your degree?  Is there any passion left there?  Is there a place that’s cool AF for that subject/activity?  (Kind of a Pilgrimage). I’m an engineer with ADHD.  Going to visit Kennedy Space Center reminded me why I got that degree.   I’m old compared to you and have a cool job now, but I was stuck doing crap I kinda hated for a long long time.  Just hang in there.  

Also, exercise is great.  Yoga is the bestest exercise because you get to meditate at the same time.  Playing music helps.  Helping other people takes the focus off of you and gives you some quick wins.  Us ADHD folks need that quick dopamine hit.

t3_u9hpyu,[Need Advice] Can you please help me in building a routine?,"
Earlier in the year, i had started off a routine with a tracker and everything. It was short lived. 

I had a couple depressive episodes and routines then became exhausting. 

I feel like i messed up my routine and now there’s so many things i need to finish . It’s making me feel unhappy to be such a shit person who doesnt get things done. I was never a routine kinda person but this is just bad. 


My other problem is I’m very unrealistic when it comes to planning, i cannot fix this as many times i have tried. I plan for things, i know based on past history, that sounds unrealistic but i keep hoping and making a plan . (Eg: morning workout).


I wanted to wakeup early, have a mental chill space before i start working. I managed doing that this week, i woke up at 6:30/7 am but I’m in bed till 9 scrolling on my phone . I have to start my laptop then lol

I just hate it.

I used to do small chores this year. And now it’s piling up and on weekends all i want to do is chill.


Things i want to do:
-Wake up at 6:30 am, sleep at 11/11:30 pm
-Work 9-5 (strictly) and not procrastinate 
-workout -hiitt/walk
-mental health -journal/meditation
-proactively do chores 
- enjoy


Can anybody help with a timetable kinda thing? Or a basic structure. I’ve created many and just dont work.

I’m so sick of this. I know i have same hours as others and some of the lists I’ve seen is brilliant and here i cant get more than one thing done a day. It’s affecting my work performance too.


Edit: thanks for all the responses. Didn’t realize this post got quite a few response. For those who are struggling too, feel free to save this thread and refer to it whenever.  Again, thanks!!","It might be useful to understand how habits work.

For habits a few things that helped me were knowing:

* They become automatic
* They can be measured (using the Self Report Habit Index) and you should record them to help with adherence
* They take longer than you think to establish (average: 66 days)
* It's generally better to start one at a time (though there are exceptions)
* They get harder before getting easy
* Implementation Intention, forming a clear trigger, is really key
* Mental Contrasting, planning for potential stumbling blocks is also a lab tested method of getting to a habit
* Tiny Habits, starting ridiculously small UNTIL the habit forms up, THEN and only then expanding it, really helps avoid the tendency to quit after 2 or 3 weeks.
* When forming they don't require a strict streak. So if you miss a day, remember that the habit is a deeper structure in the brain that is still forming. So be compassionate, pick it up tomorrow, and try not to make it a streak of missing the activity. Do not think you're starting from square one.

So right there you've got a good starting map. You might also think about how sleep works. Some things that helped me with my sleep issues were:

* Figuring out the variables that had the most impact. For me that was light and caffeine.
* Getting more light - especially 30 min as soon as I got up - significantly improved my sleep onset latency
* Programming my phone helped as well. Blue light filters automatically go on, and I""m seriously considering using the Bixby Samsung Routines app to just block all distracting apps at bed time.
* Nighttime routines are great, but most people will formalize them by saying ""I'll do X BEFORE I go to bed"". That's not how habits work. You need a trigger first - so set one if you're going to make a nighttime habit.
* Some great nighttime habits are alternative bridging activities that get you ready for bed. Journaling, stretching, light meditation, pranayama, creativity and art (non perfectionist, low stakes) works great for me.
* I found that my natural wakeup time has more to do with what I did the day before. Focusing on getting that morning light and getting to bed on time helped make waking up early *solidly* solved, and not a matter of setting a bunch of stressful alarms, which is a topical solution.

Productivity at work:

* There's a lot here, but one thing that really helped me was understanding optimal work times. I highly recommend Cal Newport's book Deep Work.
* He advocates really being strict by building up. Most people can't just jump into even a bit of deep work without strain.
* Managing productivity is a whole thing unto itself. It's navigating the post lunch slump, knowing how, when, and what breaks to take. And it's knowing how to assign what KIND of task when - if you're tired, you probably don't want to be editing anything.
* One of the best things that helped me was interspersing workouts with work. The optimal work:rest ratio is 52:17, which gives me enough time to do some micro workouts. Not only can you get a full workout in (and there are people talking about this is you look it up), but you energize yourself without tiring yourself out with a full separate workout habit. Behaviorally it also seems to lodge the workout habit (very quickly) in better because it's sandwiched between another structure of work. Obv, this depends on your work, but it's something to think about.

Hope some of that helps!","Not sure anyone else mentioned this, but... I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I spent a decade HUGELY struggling. Might be worthwhile to investigate if you've got some underlying conditions that are making it harder to start habits and manage the flow of your day.

t3_slz1uo,[Need Advice] Why do I always feel the need to sleep after lunch?,"As the title says, i really don't know why I feel tired every afternoon. Like as soon as I finish eating I need to go to sleep or spend at least 30-60 minutes on the bed.

I tried studying or doing something that I like as soon as lunch was over, but I always keep coming back to my bed. 

Any advice is appreciated, like why is this happening, how can I fix this etc...","Food intake(especially carbs) increases blood sugar(transient hyperglycemia). This is brought under control by insulin released by special cells in the pancreas. It is hypothesized that hyperglycemia reduces the level of orexin, which plays a major role in maintaining alertness. You can call it the alertness hormone.

How to manage this? Cut down on carbs, sub it with protein, reduce servings ideally. I skip lunch entirely and have breakfast and an early dinner. Haven't needed an afternoon nap unless really exhausted.","I would suggest avoiding sugar and carbs.

For breakfast and lunch, I go for low calorie meals high in protein and fiber with a little at. My breakfast during the week is a Quest bar, and my lunch varies but is usually something like a chicken soup, chili, meat and cheese (skip the crackers though), something like that. I'd also recommend spice for lunch. Eating something extremely spicy will help keep you alert. Peppers are really good for you, too.

The one exception is in the early summer when it's in season I like to have fresh fruit, especially berries, and whipped cream, because that is just one of my favorite things.

For dinner after you are mostly done being productive for the day is the time to eat your carbs."
t3_ty38dt,[NEED ADVICE] i have no structure in my life and feel lost.,"i’m 19F, and i started university last year. 

I was in compulsory education from 5-18, so i was always following a strict routine of starting and ending school at the same times.
That created routine in my life, certain lessons on certain days, and the weekends.

But now that i’ve started university I realised how much discipline i LACK.
because no one is forcing me to attend, i barely do, and it’s ironic bc i’m PAYING for this.

Eventually i fell into a slump, in doors for days on end, no sunlight ( i live in the uk ☹️ ) and ghosting the people who cared about me. I became depressed, even my hobbies didn’t excite me.

My days blurred together, i didn’t feel the same, everything seemed to be going downhill.

i have since then acknowledged the problem and seeked help like getting counselling sessions through my uni, attending, hanging out w friends n going to the gym BUT every so often i fall back into the terrible sleep schedule, bad eating habits (i have an ED) and neglecting my academics. And having no structure in my life at all.


It frustrates me so much the lack of power and control i have over my own life. i feel as if all my days are one and i’m existing as opposed to living.

Please, leave some advice on how to create routine and build discipline .

Edit - 11th. Any 2023

Hey, so it took me a year but I came to the conclusion that I actually did have ADHD…. And I was diagnosed yesterday.
I didn’t believe I had it due to the lack of education on inattentive ADHD, and also being labelled as lazy a lot, when in reality I was struggling to operate in a world which doesn’t accommodate for people like me!

Anyway, I’m really glad that I wasn’t the problem, I feel bad for being so tough on myself. 
To all of the people who told me I might have had ADHD, I wish I listened to you earlier, and to those who related to me, please get checked out it will change your life.

In terms of a life update, I start my medication soon, on 30mg elvanse, I’m nervous but I’ll see how it goes.
My life has improved significantly, I started CBT therapy which kinda changed my life tbh.
I still struggle with my sleep but I’m going to be prescribe melatonin. 
I’m doing better with university, socially, emotionally, overall, it wasn’t my fault that I wasn’t ‘disciplined’ enough, I hope this helps someone’s out there if anyone sees this. 
never give up hope

t3_xr5egr,"[Need Advice] Recovering from ""burnout""?","I put burnout in the quotes in the title because at this point I don't even think I can call it that anymore since quite a bit of time has passed.

Long story short, I was in a position doing something I used to love for over a decade. It was very stressful and busy work, lots of late nights and weekend hours along with normal business hours. Tried to make adjustments to make it tenable as I recognized burnout was likely coming if things didn't change, but obviously I didn't do enough.

A lot of the self-discipline I used to have fell by the wayside during that period. It was like mentally I lost the ability to keep up with anything outside of the bare minimum that allowed me to perform at my job.

I left that job 3 years ago. There are other things at play in the whole picture but I have been pretty much a wreck since then, and have not been able to bring myself to look for a job in that field since. The idea of it actually scares me. The issue is I don't really have any experience in other areas, so finding employment with a livable income has been nigh impossible and I am struggling to make ends meet.

What do I need to change?,"I (26f) still live with my mother (57f). I’m working on becoming independent but I’m doing something wrong because it’s not getting me anywhere. What is my problem? 

I’m so ashamed of how behind I am in life and how immature and dependent I am. I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. 

My mom doesn’t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it’s been many many years (10+).

I also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out. I also paid my tuition for one class at a local college. she still pays for my groceries and phone. I’m so embarrassed. 

She doesn’t want me to move out because she says I’m incapable of functioning and I’m trying to prove both of us wrong. I do housework, try to clean up after both of us, help her whenever I can, but I’m still basically a child and I hate myself for being so behind. 

I’m grateful, don’t get me wrong, but I’m incredibly ashamed of what it says about me that I am where I am in life.

What am I doing wrong? Should I quit school? Should I just try to find better/more work? Or is it stupid to work shitty jobs without a degree.

Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma.

It's full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.

You can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.

She sounds toxic by telling you that you can't function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.

Construction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts."

If you have some inkling of different directions you'd potentially like to explore, I would bring these up as well as your concerns.  They may not have answers, but they potentially can point you in the direction of people who may be able to help you.  Another avenue that you might want to consider is the mental health counselors.  Most of the time they are free, and they can also assist you determine what goals are important to you and how you can go about achieving those goals while filtering out the stuff that isn't helping.  Another route that you could check out would be a mentor.  Some colleges have alumni in all walks of life who volunteer their time to help mentor current students.  They can give insight based on their experiences and help you to build out your network.  Your school may also have vocational tests available that you can take that might bring something to light that you hadn't considered in the past, and give you an opportunity to explore, also using the resources available at the school.

As for the RT program specifically, see if you can shadow at a local hospital in the various areas that your degree will apply to.  Being a radiology tech gives you a potential career path in a number of areas of the hospital that you may find interesting.  Some of the procedure areas, like Cath Lab, Interventional Radiology, Electrophysiology, Interventional Neurology, and Structural Heart (to name a few) employ RTs to assist the physician during the procedures.  Spending two or three hours shadowing and observing may give you a new perspective on your degree and help you find a more focused path to follow.  Or, it could end up definitively showing you that it's not the direction you want to go, which is also a good thing to find out.

t3_sunwbq,"[Need Advice] 23 years old, been in a really dark place, now trying to win over myself and be a better person","Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like ""I didn't have much more to say"" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.

**Two minors issues**

* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).
* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  
 

**My two biggest issues**

* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking ""ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?"" and the thought really really scares me.  
 
* **Dating** \--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think ""Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?"" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).

Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**","I took a quick read through and let me just plop down some advice from my almost 30’s self. 

The desire to change and make adjustments never goes away no matter how much you change.

t3_ukmkx4,[NEED ADVICE] How do I stop procrastinating/distracting myself and get out of this loop of doing nothing?,"So basically I love learning I love books,drawing,science and music and I make ALOT of list of thing for these subjects the thing is I never get to do 1 in any of the list thing cause I wake up get on my phone watch youtube tell myself ill do it after finish watching youtube instead of reading I jerk off feel bad cause I got distracted and jerked off go on youtube and then the same shit happens for weeks I feel like a loser just writing this honestly","dawg hear me out. i’m in the same loop. and the worse is being aware it’s happening. there’s many factors that make u go back into bad habits, but the main one is thought patterns. for me there’s some triggers that aren’t even subconscious that make me become a piece of shit for the day and it’s letting my mind wander. 
when i give myself time to think about things and create distance between the things i have to do in order to reduce the anxiety of actually doing it, i just disassociate and end up wasting my time so bottom line.
materialize the things u like to do and would like to be doing. write em on a piece of paper. everything u can think of. then choose the easiest one or the one u think it’s the most enjoyable.
then the next day choose a small fraction of your day ONLY FOR THAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITY. and when the time comes be completely focused on it for the whole period of time u have established ( don’t be delusional and aim too high, remember ur still a piece of shit for now) and do the same thing for a couple of days. then u can do 2 things to further continues this beneficial loop. increase the time which u spend doing that activity or implement another one( try not to blend them, make ‘em different things). 
and another thing. morning routines bro. i noticed on myself that the way i start the day heavily impacts on how i go about my day. if i go to sleep too late and wake up feeling like shit i don’t feel like doing anything productive the whole day, so go to sleep early wake up at a good time and have 3-4 things u could do consistently every morning to establish a routine. it’s gonna make u feel at least a little rewarded even if u go on and do nothing the rest of the day. if u have trouble with sleeping i can give u some tips just tag me","well besides what the dude below said here’s my recommendations:
1- don’t eat a big meal before bed. it’s gonna make u regret being born at 3AM while u stare at the ceiling unable to sleep. if possible eat ur last meal 2 half hours before bed. 
2-completely dark out ur room. it might seem stupid but our eyes can see small lights even with our eyes shut so try to turn off all lights u have in ur room
3- i recommend if possible setting ur waking time somewhere at the rise of the sun and whenever u can going outside and doing a 10 min walk. our cells have biological clocks that activate when we see blueish-yellowish lights. it happens more at sunrise than dawn. and if u implement some exercise in the morning after ur walk it’s even better. 
4- plan your sleep in 90 min sleeping blocks. what i mean is whenever u want to go to wake up, go back in 90 min time blocks and find what’s the best time u should go to sleep. bc our bodies go through a hour and a half sleep cycles and if u wake in between one you’ll feel tired but if u have up at the end or beginning of a cycle you’ll feel more alert and refreshed. 
5–and lastly avoid using ur phone before bed. i struggle with this one cuz i’m too addicted lmao but it’s necessary. try to make your last hour or 30 min before bed a relaxing time. write a bit, read, listen to relaxing music, etc. 
also some researchers say warm showers before bed may help u fall asleep faster. 
if ur able to all of these over time it will help you have a better sleeping schedule. but start first with undoing the bad things u do and then try to implement the good things ( be on ur phone , eating)
it’s a tedious process but if u commit to it u can fix ur sleep."

Inform them you're having a difficult time, and explain how you think your performance is being impacted by your state-of-mind.

I have a big alarm clock that makes super loud noise. I installed an alarm app (alarmy) that cannot be snoozed or turned off unless I complete some math tests on the app. I tie my phone to my wrist because the vibration from alarm can wake me up. My sleep time is adequate. Yet, I fail everyday. 
The clcok? I just pushed the alarm button to ""off"".
The alarm app? Since it cannot be turned off, I switch off or even pull battery from my phone. I go back to sleep. 
Here is something more infuriating. My brother leaves home early in the morning and I leave my bed to go and lock the door after he leaves. Yet, I instead of washing my face with water, I go back to my bed and go back to sleep. The desire to sleep at that moment is so strong that no logic works in my mind. 
When I had job, I used to wake up on my own and even didn't need any alarm. The face of my ex-boss and fear of losing job made me wake up automatically. 
Now there is no fear in me when I wake up and then I go back to sleep. What an asshole I am. 
At this moment, I don't have a job but to get a job i need to ace in the competitive exams. So, I am studying hard all day but almost everyday I fail to complete my expected amount of study because I lose 3 to 4 hours in late rising in morning. Not to mention, when I wake up late and start to study late on my routine, I feel so angry. I hate myself on that moment and promise myself that it won't happen next day but unfortunately this has been going on for a long time. The desire to sleep more ruins my entire day.

I've done as much of this as possible, and now I wake up before 7AM every day with no alarm. 

Make sure you get a blood test to ensure you dont have nutrient deficiencies, and focus on eating healthy overall. But after that, the biggest things that helped me were;

1. Going to bed at the *same time* consistently, even on weekends. Along with allowing at least 8-9 hours before I have to be up.

2. Light therapy. I got a smart light that dims and shifts to a warmer color at night, and very slowly comes back on when it's time to wake up, as well as avoiding screens right before bed.

3. Sleeping in complete darkness, and a slightly cooler temperature.

4. Exercise during the day! 

5. Don't eat within a few hours before bed.

6. Getting a decent bed and pillow that work for my body type.

Everyone is different, so put in the time to experiment and see what right for you. Either way, sleep is one of the most important things for overall health and especially cognition!

I seem to be completely unaware of my abilities and capabilities. At times I’ll convince myself I can do anything in the world, and on other times I’ll convince myself I’m a good for nothing failure.

I’ve always been a procrastinator as long as I can remember. I have a hard time focusing and starting a task and finishing a task. I push things off saying “I’ll do it tomorrow”. I’ve been lucky to go to a univeristy with a full-ride scholarship as I wouldn’t of been able to go without. I fucked up my first year with failing some classes and getting C’s in others.

I just finished 2 summer classes, one I got an A and the other a C+. When I told my grandma I got a C+, she became very upset and asked why. It makes sense as she helped pay for the 2 classes.

I’m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It’s bad because i’ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.

But I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.

For any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.

For myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything.

I’m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that’s making you feel bad. But it’s a good place to start when trying to get on track. 

Protect your sleep. Do that by:

- Going to bed at the same time every night. 
- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)
- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)
- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)

Also, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you’ve lost all progress when you screw up once. 

Protecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period."

19 year old kid, turning 20 in a couple months. I guess the best thing to describe me is that I'm someone who's struggling to accept the fact that I'm not a kid anymore, and that even though I'm still very young in the grand scheme of things, I feel like I'm already set in place for one bad life.

For context, I grew up in an Asian household with strict, but fair and loving parents. I was your typical student who got A's and B's up until my sophomore year in HS where I basically gave up on it. Grades dropped and did only the very bare minimum to breeze through with a low C. I eventually only graduated because of COVID when my HS put in some VERY lenient standards for its students (for example, there was nothing that could lower your grade in classes. Not doing homework? Not showing up to those zoom calls? Perfect, my C in that class would remain unchanged). Woohoo class of 2020.

Skipped the fall 2020 semester at my local CC because of my laziness and irresponsibility to register early. I did my first semester in Spring the following year and failed all my classes. Now I just missed this year's fall semester again because of the same reason before.

Now, I'm unemployed with no driver's license. I have my fourth try in a couple weeks (I failed twice for stupid mistakes, and I couldn't even take it the third because my brakelight went out). All I do is sleep, play video games, watch porn, sleep, repeat. I have a horrible sleeping schedule (sleep at 4 AM, wake up at 2 PM).

I've now realized that I'm a useless piece of shit mooching off of my parents with no sense of direction in life. I blame no one for how I am right now. This was all my fault and I'm struggling to improve.

I'm slowly starting to fix my sleeping schedule, I'm making sure to do chores at home because I don't leave the house anyways, I'm working out to at least improve my physique and mental health, I'm making the effort to push the porn aside because that shit's a virus, but even after all that, I feel like I'm already doomed in life.

Roughly. (I am not Asian and I got far worse grades than you)

 Things that helped:

1. Adopt responsibility for a few things where people *really* rely on you to show up. This could be a job for a small business. This could be volunteering someplace. Whatever it is there has to be real negative consequences if you don't show or if you call in sick. It'll get you going so the days don't just slide by. It is a huge boost to have people rely on you and to be contributing in a real way to helping other people succeed. Progressively adopt more and more responsibility. It changes everything. 
2. Definitely quit the porn and probably the video games. Too much easy dopamine. Dopamine is what will get you out of bed and looking for work, trying new things, meeting people, etc. You don't want to use all of it up on stuff that isn't moving you forward.
3. You are on the right track with a predictable and consistent daily schedule and some fitness habits. That made a big difference. I'm just not sure I could have implemented this without also doing #1 above.
4. As soon as possible, move out of your parents house. Its just too hard to be yourself, take responsibility, and to contribute when you live with your parents. Or it was for me. I found a friend/coworker looking for a roommate to share the rent. This is part of number one."

One of the interesting points that was mentioned in their convo was that *a lot* of sleep issues are behavioural (meaning, we thankfully have the power to fix them), but that these behavioural effects are difficult to parse from the biological effects that create true sleep disorders. 
TLDR: the only way to know how screwed up your sleep really is, is to optimize all the behavioural aspects of sleep that you actually have control over and then see how much better your sleep situation can get."

Well since I went back to school in September I no longer have any structure in my life as everything is online and pre recorded. I was still going to bed by 4-5am and wake up for 11am.

January, things have changed. I don’t remember the last time I went to bed without the sun in my eyes. I’m sleeping at 7am-10am and waking up like 4-6pm everyday. I keep missing my one non-recorded class. I’m depressed because I wake up and it’s dark. And when I have plans at, for example, 6pm, and I wake up at 5:45, I have to make up an excuse bc the truth is too embarassing. I’ve been making up excuses since 2020 but I could also tell the truth sometimes since waking up at 12 can be understandable, especially bc I was working ~60hrs/week.

Now I’ve got all these lies and it’s hard to keep track of what I’ve said. Add in the sleep deprivation and I don’t even remember saying half of them, and if any are actually true. Im so sick of being like this but every time i reset my sleep schedule it’s messed up again within a day. One time i started my day at 4am and still went to bed at 7am the next morning. Please help me. Also I have ADHD which I know is a large contributing factor","You’re right, a lot of people with ADHD have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS)! It sounds like you were really burned out too and you were likely experiencing revenge bedtime procrastination. I wouldn’t be surprised if you were left feeling under stimulated and unable to sleep by the end of the day because of having to work so many hours without getting to do anything personally interesting?     
    
Anyway, it sounds like maybe you should just come clean to some people about what’s been going on if you can. Sometimes we just have to swallow our pride and expose the embarrassing truth because we need help. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Please be kind to yourself, because it sounds like you’ve been trying your best and it’s been really difficult!    

Also, have you considered getting professional help from a therapist? If you find the right one, they’re great for helping to teach the right tools to keep yourself from spiraling into bad situations like that and managing ADHD. And also the depression. I’ve been there, and I know it’s not fun, and I know that it can be hard to take the initiative to try to make things better on your own, so consider getting help!    

Maybe also try posting this to the ADHD sub, as I’m sure you’re not alone in this. I’m not the best with sleep hygiene myself, given that I also have ADHD.

Edit: as another commenter said: exercise is important! Never used to like to do it, but I sleep so much better and I actually really like working out now. Provides some good stimulation for that ADHD brain!","Hey brother wow I’m exactly the same. It’s almost like I’m wired to be awake at night still alert. I don’t like winters either short days. My advice to myself & you is to put an alarm 30 minutes earlier everyday & put timer when using phone at night. Eat healthy, must exercise to get tired 😴. Socialize when you can to destres"

t3_qy30r8,[Need Advice] How to Overcome Self-Sabotage and the Fear of the unknown.,"It's almost two months from the day I told myself to change for the better, physically, mentally and academically. But as typical of me, I've done nothing but put it off. ""O I'll start Tomorrow, today my study table is not in order"" then tomorrow comes and I put it off to the next. In doing so I kinda lost believe and faith in myself.

I've basically wasted the last 6 years of my life. And I've gotten so accustomed to this current state of being--lazy, unmotivated, no plans, unemployed, obese, depressed,anxious--that any move towards a positive change scared me. Am afraid of change and what lies beyond. 

I know am supposed to be hitting the gym, I know am supposed to be ahead of the teacher, I know I should diet. But for some strange reason I can't move forward. It all sounds good in my head but I cant put it to action. its like am in invisible shackles.  So far am 20 chapters behind and we're in the final stretch of the semester and am still procrastinating.

My self sabotage is beyond belief. I know what am supposed to do and I know how guilty I would feel if i don't do it. But I still don't do what's required of me.  
Also I got an extreme 12hr/day phone addiction. And am currently afraid for my future. Will I be stuck for the next 6 years?

And finally am afraid of what lies beyond, the uncertainty kills me. Am so deep into my comfort zone, which consists of nothing but bad habits,e.g in bed 24/7 with my phone glued to me. It feels like I've been stripped of my manhood. I'll always  choose the path of least resistance. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.","You need to realise that without trying, you will not change. Trying might feel scary and uncomfortable but you need to realise that without discomfort, no growth can happen. Don't plan to change everything at once. That just makes everything overwhelming. Start by doing one new thing, EVERY day. After a month, you might start noticing a change. That will give you some wins under your belt and you'll start believing that change is possible after all, which will give you energy to continue and expand to add another thing to your daily to do list. What you do and how often and how much is up to you. The more effort, the faster the results. The balancing act is adding a many things to your to do list without feeling overwhelm.","There is probably some inner resistance that is keeping you on this behavioral pattern. Chances are, you actually want to procrastinate. So, you need to understand what exactly you are resisting.

You can try the Cost-Benefit Analysis from CBT to see what is holding you back (Check out David Burns)  and whether it's really worth it or not.

Running away isn't the solution. You can run but you can't hide from your problems.

t3_pc5qcr,[Need Advice] What are some tips for people who can't sleep because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts?,"Lately I've been noticing that at nights I find myself unable to sleep and put my thoughts to rest. It's like all day I'm distracted by something but at nights the alone time makes me very anxious.

I fixate on my beating heart and overthink about it. Some nonsensical worry that if I stop focusing on it, it will stop.

There are other thoughts like that too.

I have tried guided meditation for sleep and other tricks but they don't always help.

Any tips from someone who experienced the same but got over it?","Sometimes when I can't sleep I picture a little stepladder having a conversation with a regular six foot ladder.

t3_qc1pcz,[Need Advice] I really want to start working out but going to the gym makes me conscious,"So I have always been a big guy and gaining all this weight throughout the years made me lose my self-confidence. I was riddled with anxiety, and I had given up on myself to be honest. But a health scare happened to me a few months ago and it woke me up and made me prioritize myself, especially my health. I recently started dieting, mostly just cutting out processed foods for now, and I am trying my best to keep doing it even though there are some temptations along the way. But sometimes it’s just so hard to ignore some cravings for unhealthy food and that frustrates me.

But aside from dieting, I also want to start working out since I know physical activity is really important in losing weight and improving your health. I have a spin bike and a treadmill at home that I use, but sometimes I get lazy and lose the will to move so I feel like I need some external motivation, that’s why I’m thinking of going to the gym. However, the mere thought of going there makes me anxious and conscious because of how I look. I need some advice guys. Thank you very much.","If you have issues with binging or your eating habits in general, you can go to a therapist for that for some help. Also, I understand that you feel self-conscious about going to the gym, and that’s what I felt too. If you’re really not comfortable with going to one, you can try getting a remote personal trainer from platforms like [Outright Fitness](https://outrightfitness.com/remote-training/) or [CoPilot](https://mycopilot.com/?r=1). You can start with that first until you’re finally comfortable and confident enough to go and workout in a gym. Just take your time and don’t pressure yourself.","Which is worse, your health scare or maybe someone judging you?

t3_zo1su6,What are some things to do alone at night? [Need Advice],"So whenever I have a day off from work I like to spend time at the gym, spend time at a coffee shop learning stuff and take walks during the day. Although those are good things to do, when the night comes around I don't know what else to do since I did all the stuff I wanted during the day. I don't have any friends so I need some advice on what to do for fun outside of my house on a weekend night. Normally I get into my bad habits at night where I would just watch youtube videos and play video games with some people that may be ok to do but for me, I think it leads to more bad habits that I have like masturbation and watching porn because I get too comfortable at home and therefore start doing bad habits at night and then it leads me getting discouraged because of what I did. My goal is to get out of the house until it gets too late outside, like I said I don't want to be at home and try to replace a bad habit with a good habit because I usually do my good productive habits outside of the home and I treat my home as a place to relax and be comfortable, but I get too comfortable to the point that I start watching porn and eating junk food. So the only way I can avoid this is by leaving the house all day but my question is what are some things that I can do on a day off from work and on a weekend night alone?

Also, another question is what do you guys do on your day off from work or on the weekends to have fun? I don't want something like reading or learning since I already do that during the day.",There is nothing wrong with exercising at night,I love video games but have a hard time with “just one hour” bc I get so engrossed and have such a good time.

Any tips on how I can continue using my phone as my alarm clock but not doom scroll first thing in the morning and just go take a shit like a normal person? Thanks.","Get a proper alarm clock and keep your phone away from where you sleep. Plus to train your mind not to be addicted to your phone, change the settings to black and white, it really helps. It’s a gradual process but it works.","On samsung you could set a Bixby routine or use Digital Wellbeing to disable all your doom scrolling apps.

t3_ulm73x,"[Need Advice] How to ""outgrow"" from being raised in a household that always yells at each other."," This only came up when a friend in a friend group spoke up about not liking when we joked about him. Im sure everyone has dealt with friendly banter but I guess it gets to some people. I've had shit said to me that I didn't appreciate but had to play off too.

This got me thinking about my family. Literally my entire life we would yell at each other. I Think its mainly my dads fault cuz hes got like a .004 second fuse and blows up at everything.

Once he yells I yell back and then if anyone else butts in they get yelled at and start yelling too. The thing is I've tried being calmer with my tone but either I get yelled at or I get frustrated and start yelling first.

The thing is no one ever hold grudges, but things get really heated really quick and a lot of shit is said that is almost instantly regret and I always worry if what I said might've like deeply hurt them.

I've been hurt by the things my parent yell at me but I always see it as a ""ah they didn't mean it, they only got heated.... right?""

I know this is bad and ""unhealthy"" but I don't know how to go around it. Being calm and polite to them doesn't work. Its really hard to not yell back when being yelled at too. Should I start ignoring them if they start yelling? Once the yelling starts I don't think I can keep calm...

I guess how are you supposed to react to being yelled without yelling yourself?","So in my toxic household, trying to disengage and not interact or sticking to the status quo always gave the same result. No matter how hard I tried, it actually seemed to set my parents off faster. But its good you see it and want to change it, that's huge. So congrats on that part. In my adult life I refuse to argue with people, and by extension be yelled at or yell back and forth. If it's something that needs to be talked about, it will be talked about after both parties take a breather and are at the point of actually talking to each other. Until then, the subject needs to be left alone. If it's something that can be left as ""agree to disagree"" then sometimes that is best. It wasn't an easy learning process, but I've learned you'll say things while angry that you don't necessarily mean and then that festers until it gets brought up. Normally out of nowhere. Learning to deal with your emotions so They don't control you in certain situations would help. That would differ from person to person though. But thats what helped me, and ultimately helped with me choosing not to argue with people. What others still continue to try and do is nothing I can control, remember that.","I came to live with my husband over 12 years ago. We were still bf and gf back then. I came from a yelling-everything family and I brought the yelling in this household too. It wasn't always arguing, but simply different views. 

I am maybe lucky to have the partner I do, that kept calm and never yelled back. Took me years to unlearn the yelling after over 20 years of it being something normal. These last 2 years I can't remember yelling once, but I might remember smth before these 2 years. 

It is an urge deep inside, but it comes easy with practicing few steps, especially when you are the one engaging someone else in conversation:

1. Think of what you need to say and if it is actually important saying. Sometimes we act out of impulse, giving 0 thoughts to how this might carry on. 

2. Do you really need a feedback on something or you already know what's to be expected from the other person? In the intimacy of a family, you already know, from past emcounters what the other person wants or needs or what view has. Some questions make others wander if you are actually listening to them and it gets frustrating to know you pay no attention and, coming back to them with a similar situation or question, may fuel some negative feeling. This is why thinking on past situations might help. 

3. Know, before engaging with anyone in a conversation, that voices might be raised. Allow yourself to calm down first (because knowing what will come will give you a start-up of your own ""bubbling"" even before you say the first word). It is important to forgive the other person even before they yell at you. It is even best when you go into a conversation with this positive attitude and no one is yelling. For me, this was amazing. Now I rarely feel joy about it :) ...well, because no one is yelling anymore these days haha!

4. Confirmation. This is important for a person that yells. Going into a conversation with this type of people (and I know, because I was one too) is to approve what they say if you indeed approve with them. This should be the only way to talk back to them before getting a chance to speek as well. Let them speak/yell what they need to ""let out"" and till they are finished, just tell them "" I agree with that view too"" (or something similar, depending what it is said), or even nodding helps, while they talk. This will defuse the state of mind they are in. When it is your turn to speak, start with letting them know you agree with what they said (it is even better if you actually say, word by word, what are you agreeing with), and then approach a different view ifbit is the case(smth like a question: ""what do you think if this happens"", "" I hear you and I think I need an advice if smth goes different, what should I do?""). But!!! Sometimes is ok if you let a period of time to cool and come back to them and just telling them you thought of what they said and then start with agreeing with their view/perspective. Afterwords bringing up other things you need to follow up with. Giving them the feeling they are important in any matter of your life is something they find peaceful and they will be in a different set of mind. 

In time, yelling family members will learn that they can talk to you in a different manner. They will come to you too and  the same ""lay-back"" situation you can apply. Even if they start yelling first and you don't have that thinking time ahead, you can just agree, trying to pay attention to the message itself and not letting your voice to get too high. You can actually ask them to let you think of what they ask you or tell you and reassure them that you will give your feedback. 

For you, dear OP, it will be easier to change than for them. They did not thought of change as you did. Asking them now to stop yelling is an insult and I'm sure you don't want them feel like this. They will see, little by little that you'll yell less and less and that you listen more and maybe, one day, they will change too. 

I can report now that my relationship with my family is yelling-free. They yell at each other sometimes, but in relationship with me, because I sticked with my plan, they stopped. And OP,  it is such a beautiful thing to have this type of conversations, even if we disagree with each other, no more yelling 🥳

You have a long way ahead of you if, you want to start this process. Think that it is possible, but allow it to get fixed in years too. It is not a ""out of nowhere"" thing. 

Please remember to be kind to yourself first of all. The way you described things I do too think that they love you and not everything that they yell is meant to harm you (actually nothing is). Listen to the message, not the voice. 

I hope this works out for you and your loved ones :) because one day, dear redditor, you will feel as I do and I promise, it is SO WORTH IT! 

I wish you best of luck and a happy life! 😇✌"

t3_r33noq,[NEED ADVICE] Issue regarding sleep and motivation to work (will be discussing porn and porn usage),"For the past two years, I have been sleeping, dreaming about me being a sissy and pleasuring different people I have met and am friends with. I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.

The worst thing about this addiction is that I don’t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked. Whenever I think about being the dude in sex, I stay up all night. But the moment I think about me getting plowed by a dick, I sleep like a baby.

This thinking is severely affecting my career. Me, doing a master’s in finance, have to give a lot of presentations. Since watching sissy porn, my confidence has dropped a lot, and I am shy all the time. My manhood is being affected by this type of porn.

I am unable to be the focus on my studies as well. I am so attracted to this type of porn that I have started missing my online lectures, or I watch porn during the lectures on my phone.

I don’t know how to cope up with this addiction. Can anyone help me spiral out of this hypnotic porn?","Seek.

-I think I made it to 6th or 7th grade until I stopped school completely

-I want to go to college spring 2024, but I don’t know where to start

I’m not sure if I’m even in the right subreddit for this but I’m kind of desperate and genuinely just truly embarrassed at this point. I’m 24 y/o and never went through high school.

I grew up in a Christian homeschooled household and to make a very long story short, since middle school my parents never kept me accountable with my school work. I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off. That coupled with my parents never checking up on how I was doing/if I was completing my schoolwork, my education just slipped through the cracks. I started working and moved out when I was 17.

I’ve been hospitalized over psychosis from breaking from stress. But the worst part is that I know the jobs I do would be mild-mid stress level for most people but it just overwhelms me . I’ve been trying different antidepressants and anxiolytic medicines, and still attend therapy, but it doesn’t help me enough to function more than a year (if that) in a “real job”



And another thing I would love some direction in is validation seeking. I have such low self image and self worth that I’m always seeking validation from others. I try to show off stupid things that I admit are somewhat impressive the first time but I can’t help but keep prompting validation from others. Due to my mental health issues, I have lost contact with a lot of friends as I reclused myself. And now I’m so desperate for human interaction that people I meet can feel it I think. I feel like my desperation drives people away, which fuels my desperation. 


Can someone here please help a wayward soul find some resolution?","I am sorry to hear that you’re dealing with such difficulties. Dealing with anxiety and depression is a real bitch. Like you, I have dealt with anxiety and depression for a majority of my life. I have spent thousands of hours in therapy, tried different medications, treatment methods, all with varying results but the one constant in my life seems to be the depression and anxiety. 

Not unlike you, I grew up in an unstable environment, I never really felt comfortable or safe at home, school or anywhere really. I was constantly on edge, almost always in fight-or-flight mode. I constantly worried about what in my environment might hurt me and looked for ways I could find refuge or relief. I internalized all of these feelings and as I grew up I continued to deal with it on my own by withdrawing into myself and shutting down when things got overwhelming. 

I believe the self-doubt, insecurity, anxiety, and depression are the result of my experiences growing up and how I chose to deal with them, along with a sprinkling of genetic predisposition, of course :)

Fast-forward to today, not much has changed in how I deal with my experiences and feelings. That’s where the problem lies. I continue to work with a therapist and try different treatment methods, but it continues to be a long and difficult journey. Changing habits that have been engrained in your brain over many years, habits used to protect yourself (often successfully) from the outside world, is a complicated and arduous process. It is certainly doable, but it will not be easy. 

I have made notable progress with my mental health in the past couple of years but recently I have been struggling so forgive me for the length of this comment; writing this feels therapeutic for me. Although I do not have an exact answer for you on where to get started or how to make an immediate impact on your mental health, I can spout off a few thoughts that have helped on my journey:

If nothing else, It is important to always keep in mind that the journey to the promised land of mental well-being is not a linear progression, there will be many ups and downs. Keep going through difficulties. 

While it is important to persevere through difficult times, it is equally important to recognize when something is not working for you. Knowing when it is the right time to change course and try something new is a difficult question to answer, especially when you’re already full of self-doubt, but only you can decide to keep trying. 

That said, it is immensely helpful to have someone that you can talk to and to hold you accountable, be it a therapist, partner, family member, or friend. Find someone that you can trust, to be open and honest with so that you can honestly discuss your problems and get help when you need it. 

Strive to be radically honest with yourself and with others. You will not change unless you are honest with yourself about what needs to change. This goes for dealing with your therapist or someone who is helping and holding you accountable: they cannot help unless you are being honest, even when it hurts. 

I hope this helps. I feel better for writing my thoughts out. Thank you for sharing yours.","Ohhh cured, thanks!"

It is like me trying to compare to an olympic medallist who works out 30hrs/ week at the gym, and Im jealous because I dont have a six pack like him. I cannot keep up with 30hrs/week workouts. 

2) Understand that yeah you suck on many things, BUT you are good on something. Look at where you are good at, and keep polishing those skills. Believe me! You can become a beast on something that you already have some talent or you just like it a lot. Hard work will always beat ANYTHING. 

3) Enjoy the small things. Get up and say man, Im alive. I can breathe. Im thankful for that. There is a lot of people dying right now cause of covid who cannot even breath properly man. Thats f*cked up. We can breath. We can walk. We can bake. Be grateful for that!

t3_uiyesu,[need advice] on how to get unstuck,"I apologize if someone asked this already, but I've been demotivated and stuck lately. 
I have so many things to do and only thinking about it makes me feel paralysed. I wanna take action but I really can't. 
When something similar happened in the past I used to waste time watching motivational videos on YouTube, now I can't even find the will to do so (I mean, this is not entirely bad). 
I just don't want to do anything at all but at the same time I want to do what I have to/like to do. 
I don't know if it has to do with perfectionism or my low self esteem in general: I sometimes feel like I'm the dumbest person in the world, everything I do comes out pretty bad, or if I'm studying I just feel like I can't really understand. I don't always feel this way, but anytime I do something I'm proud of, it doesn't take longer before I realise I've been delusional about it. 
Any similar experience? Does anybody know how to get out of this?","When I find myself into a very demotivated state I tend to lean on this daily habit I have where I make a todo list of 1-5 things I want to get done.  If I am really unmotivated the list my only be 1-2 things and they are very easy todo.  If I am having a better day it might be 5 things and a lot more ambitious.  The idea is that no matter how small the thing is that you do you are moving your life forward.  This helps a lot because the biggest motivator is seeing results.

What can go hand in hand with this is breaking down your goals into the smallest possible steps.  When your break down your goals to very small steps then all you need to do is look at the step right in front of you and take it.  Once you take enough steps you will hit the finish line.","This totally makes sense. I'll try this way.

t3_vpyfhz,[Need Advice] Strong pull toward inaction when it comes to doing unpleasant activities.,"For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I'd legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I've done just that before.

I realize it will ultimately come to ""just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc"" which is fine. But ideally I'd like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","Here’s the thing - it’s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that’s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.

One of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.

So here’s the tips:
1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.
2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.
3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.
4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.
5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.

Eventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",I realised recently my messy room was a coping mechanism. I found it hard to clean up because a messy room was a barrier to entry when I was younger (nothing too sinister just a method of protecting my privacy) maybe you have a similar situation.

t3_q1bfdu,[NEED ADVICE] I easily lose motivation and feel like a failure due to my undisciplined life.,"Hello everyone. I am here to share my heart with you all. Please be patient and hear me out. 
I am a 27 year old guy with a 9-7 job, 5 days a week. I lead a healthy lifestyle where I go to gym 4-5 days a week. My life seems quite satisfactory to people around me. I feel motivated too till everything around me is going smooth, but as soon as I lack somewhere in my routine like when I oversleep in the morning and arrive late at work or when I am not able to finish my day to day tasks on time, I get these anxiety attacks where I feel I have become a failure and will not be able to do much in life. 
I feel life I am not progressing at all and this thought haunts me even more when I see people my age achieving milestones while I am here struggling to keep up with my everyday life. 

I feel I lack discipline. Can you suggest me something to help me cope up with this situation?","Since I’m about 30 years older than you I would like to give you my perspective from my age. Once you get into your 40s and especially your 50s you realize that all of those milestones are not as important as they seemed in your 20s. Everybody’s life has a different path and while others may be hitting certain milestones those may not be your milestones. You’ll achieve other milestones that are important for your life. And when you reach your 40s and 50s you’ll realize that the only thing that’s really important is that you’re happy. You’ll realize that a job that you enjoy is the most important thing because living your entire career for Fridays and holidays and vacation days is a horrible way to live. And I know because I did that for 26 years. Find some thing you love that doesn’t make you dread Sunday night because you know Monday’s coming and you don’t live for days you don’t have to go to work. Find friends that are loyal and true that you can completely be yourself with, your quirky, weird side no one really gets to see. And if you’re creating a bucket list of things you’d like to do don’t wait, go do them right now. Because you don’t know what 20 or 30 years down the line in your life will look like. And I know because at 50 I became disabled. And now I cannot accomplish many of the things that were on my bucket list. I hope somehow this was helpful. But just judge your life by how you feel and not what everyone else is doing. And the things you don’t get done today, they will still be there tomorrow to finish. Be kind to yourself. And if the panic attacks continue please talk to your doctor. You don’t really realize how severe they are until you stop having them. Also try some meditation and some yoga. That probably sounds a little weird but it works and I know because I’ve tried it. And even though nobody likes to talk about it our mental health is incredibly incredibly important.",This comment was extremely helpful to me in this moment. Thank you for sharing.

i’m so sorry if this post is annoying, i just don’t know what to do. please help me. 

i think a lot. my mind is always working and it’s exhausting as fuck. 

whatever i observe in day to day life, my mind is going to contemplate on it, find a way to link it to my own life somehow, and overthink to the point of self-rumination. i cannot stop it. 

i keep making up scenarios of what could go wrong with my life and worry every second i’m alive. i cannot live in the moment, i’m always thinking about the future and the what-ifs. 

my mind finds a way to link whatever it sees to something in my life. 

saw some news that somebody slipped and died. now i’m forever worrying, whenever i’m away from my parents, if they’re okay. what if they fell? what if something happened to them?

if i see some random homicide news i’m 24*7 scared for the next few days that someone will kill my family. “my father yelled at some guy the other day, what if that guy happens to be some psycho and starts plotting out of anger??” and i cannot sleep the whole night. 

saw a show where a couple broke up after 8 years of dating, 2 months before their wedding, because one of them wanted to discover who they are outside of a relationship. what if that happens to me? what if my boyfriend breaks up with me randomly, long into our relationship, because of this? 

what if he someday randomly says he has changed his mind and wants to settle abroad and we have to break up? 

what if my dog dies of xyz accident the way i saw on the news? 

and 1273827383 other types of what-ifs. everyday i find a new thing to obsess about, worry myself SICK with my anxiety running wild and basically just make sure i’m permanently unhappy even if things are okay in my life because my bitch ass anxiety has me fixated over the things going wrong in my IMAGINATION.

i hate this, i hate myself, i feel like i’ll never be happy. please help me. i just want to be happy and want my mind to shut the fuck up.","Use David Burns' material: his books and/or his free online depression course at feelinggood.com 

The thoughts you're thinking are called ""Automatic Negative Thoughts"". Even if you're not depressed, the same methods he teaches can be used to handle these thoughts. A lot of his methods are about handling automatic negative thoughts.

You can talk back to the thoughts:

""Thank you, brain! Thank you for sharing!"" (from a video link somebody posted on this subreddit in the last few months) while smiling and then ignoring it

""What if it doesn't?""

""What about the 999,999 people that isn't going to happen to?"" (The what-if generating part of the brain doesn't tend to be impressed by logic, the word ""not"", or small probabilities, though; it's more into pictures, associations and emotions. So this kind of reasoning might not help much but it doesn't hurt.)

""There's a thought. OK. Right now is the time for sleeping. Tomorrow at 10AM I'll sit down with paper and pencil and work out whether there's any action to be taken on that."" (After a few days, if you really do sit down and work things out, even if it's to write ""no action required"", your brain tends to learn to trust that and sleep.) Keep a pad of paper beside the bed to write down a couple of words as a reminder when any concerns pop up.

Taking action on your concerns, for example suggesting to your father not to yell; learning not to yell yourself, etc. can help calm these thoughts down (I think -- or does it encourage them?)

Often when we worry, it's our subsconscious trying to distract us from our real concerns. Think about what you're really supposed to be taking action on now -- Income tax forms? Studying for a test? etc. -- and take some action every day on those things. Then the subconscious won't need to think up worries to distract you.

I find it helps to take a few minutes just before going to sleep, to meditate and clear the mind. Rather than thinking about something, by having an empty mind, it allows any deeper worries to come up and also be calmed and set aside. Otherwise, when I start to fall asleep, I stop thinking about whatever I was thinking about, and then the deeper worry steps in and wakes me up.",Thank you OP for posing the question…and footpathmaker for the great response.

I’m 23 now and I’ve destroyed my life. I got out of college and went to a party school right out of high school(I had no friends in hs and I was a loser) rushed a top ranked sorority and started going out every night( I ended freshman year with a 1.0 gpa) I did better my second year but my parents caught me smoking and made me drop out of college and move home. I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.
I got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn’t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I’ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I’m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don’t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I’ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy.

t3_qwmoqm,[Need Advice] I can't start my life since I don't have a good plan. How can I provide for myself?,"Where do I begin?

I'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.

I thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)

But even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my ""career"" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?

I forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.","First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   


You absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   


It is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like ""!?!"" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   


Now that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   


1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   


2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  


CC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   


If you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   


3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   


Odds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   


4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   


Point being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   


You say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.","Check out www.selfauthoring.com They offer a series of writing exercises designed by clinical psychologists aimed at helping people to clarify a long term vision for their lives. IIRC, they tested it in a few universities, and it lowered the drop out rate pretty significantly.

You might also want to check out www.understandmyself.com They offer a personality assessment in accordance with the Big 5 model of Personality Theory. It can help you understand what your innate temperament and values are, what career paths would be a good fit for it, and what aspects of your personality you might want to consciously develop. 

Both are pretty cheap, evidence-based and tested. They offer much more practical insight than systems like Myers Brigs or the Enneagram or other stuff like that."
t3_12w7lt2,"[Need Advice] I’m in Russiа and I might get drafted, yet I’m too lazy to do anything","Hi, everyone. My current situation is absurdly bad and I have no clue what to do. I asked people on some other subs, but ultimately every single variant is fucked in some way and it’s hard to choose the best one of them.

In a month I’ll be 18, which means I could get conscripted to the army and I’d probably end up in Ukraine, which not only I believe is plainly wrong and immoral, to me that would also be a death sentence. Knowing all of that, I want to get out of here, but here’s a problem - I don’t have any money and my parents neither.

Lack of support in this tough situation really makes me feel awful. I’ve got nobody nowhere. I am on my own in this very fucked up place.

See, despite being in such a bad situation, I can’t do anything. I used to be on medication for depression (it wasn’t a clear diagnosis, but two psychiatrists said I should use the meds) and recently I stopped using them, because I’m too lazy to go to a psychiatrist once again to get a new prescription. You could say: “Oh, the reason you’re not doing anything is because you’re not on meds”, but the truth is, it was exactly the same way as before.

Instead of researching new options, I’m positing here on reddit waiting for people to tell me new variants. Instead of actually doing anything meaningful, I just go do my hobbies, like music production and UI design and I still have no clue how to make money in these two spheres.

I’m literally slowly causing my own demise. It’s fucking awful. But I’m just too tired. I don’t know what to do. Even the possibility of dying doesn’t make me care about it.

How can I possibly start doing something and be more disciplined? I truly want to get out of here, but I’m just tired of everything.

It’s not laziness but rather I don’t feel much purpose in doing anything. I have a garden that I should work in more but That I don’t really care about as much as I used to.

When was the last time you had a long talk with yourself about what you truly want to get out of life? What things, experiences and traits do you value most? If time and money didn't matter, what would you be doing with your time and your life? What gets you excited beyond any form of reason? 

You don't randomly feel purpose in life, you've got to actively search for it and create it. It starts with those kinds of questions.","I'd suggest starting with something small. I feel you very well, when you mention this and that and that one, and one more thing. Obviously, you can't do lots of small things 'a little bit' - they'll take away your focus and energy.

Instead, start with... nothing. Do an experiment: try to avoid social media for, let's say, one day. Keep it simple. Then try for more. Keep it going.

t3_ys1amz,[Need Advice] I'm feeling lost in life and unmotivated,"not feeling motivated in life?

Everytime I think about the future I just see this void. When I was younger I had dreams and ambitions. One of them was to be an actress but I grew out of that dream and no longer want it. Now I completely feel lost in life cause I don't know what I want anymore. And i don't just mean career wise because that's just a very small part of it. Even money don't motivate me that much anymore. I have a job and I get paid every week. I feel like if I was  the same person I was when I was younger I would be so happy to have that money and don't get me wrong, I am happy to get paid every week and I am thankful and i like the fact that i get to buy stuff but there's also this numbness inside of me that's just like ""Okay but have nothing to spend it on"" I feel like all I do now is save save save but I don't have an actual goal or destination.

I just feel lost and numb to my future...","As someone who has struggled with this as well; first off it does get better. My best advice is to ground yourself more. When you're feeling lost you're actually casting judgment on the world and your life, you're interpretating things in a way that doesn't point forward anymore.  Don't cling too tightly to any self definition or sense of ego if you start to regain it, you're always changing.

I would advise you to lead with your heart instead of your head. If you've struggled with these things for a while, coming to the very true realization that our perception of the world is fallible and learning to rely on a sense of community/interconnectedness, and an acceptance of paradoxes for this reason is important. 

Feeling lost/like life is meaningless is actually our rational brain's attempt at understanding the world as a constant framework. Rather than seeking a constant (which you will never find) you can move forward in a way that never demands it, but is still positive (this is how we all were as kids, where we decided we didn't know enough about how the world worked yet). Hope that makes sense.",For people struggling existentially like this I can speak from personal experience what OP needs is something to ground them to life and a stabilizing interpretation to move forward; meditation is great but it can actually wipe away these and force you to a horrible existential place where all exterior connection is removed

I don’t know when I will get out of this trap that I’ve created within me.","You're overthinking.

Overthinking is a paralyzing poison.

I've been in these exact same shoes (worse even, almost killed myself) and wasted years of my life, until I started living by this one single mantra, recommended by my therapist.

>Don't think, just act

You want to learn to drive a car? Break it into tiny doable steps first. Say, step one would be to contact the driving instructor. And then you should vocalize the above line ""Don't think, just act"". You don't even need to think about what you'll say to him. You should just pick up your phone and dial the number. That's the job. Don't think anything more. Call him. And take it from there.

You are wound up about doing any activity? (Make sure the activity is manageable first of) All you need to do in that instant is recite the above mantra. 

You know that all you need to do is act. The trick to doing so is stop overthinking. And I can't stress this enough, quote the above at every instant your mind thinks of doing anything. Use the quote as a trigger to seize all thoughts and just getting your ass up and doing it.

I know it's counter intuitive to not think about something to really do it. All out logic says that the more I think about a certain task, the more familiar I will get with it and the easier it must be to do. Bur trust me when I say it doesn't work this way. Overthinking is the not the answer.","This, but also: Try to do really nothing for a while. Don't turn on your pc or use your phone. After a while, your brain starts to come up with shit to do. All the distractions are keeping you from doing things. When your bored it's easier to motivate yourself to do things."
t3_qfejgi,[Need Advice] I get too scared to work on my assignments,"I often procrastinate with my assignments out of fear, I find myself doing anything possible to avoid the task at hand because it’s too daunting so I wait until the clock is shoving me to start the work, days before the deadline which never goes well because it’s just sleep deprivation and mental breakdowns.

The 5 second rule doesn’t even work for me because my head knows I’m trying to trick myself, my brain has also gotten so good at rationalizing and reasoning my avoidance behaviors that I don’t even really feel guilty in the moment for not doing the work like I used to. It feels like I have reached new heights with procrastination and can’t seem to avoid it, it’s probably the worst it’s ever been. 

Another thing to note is that I really struggle to sit at my desk with my computer. Even when I force myself to sit at my desk to start my work (sometimes even being in tears out of sheer fear) I get started on the work but the slightest inconvenience like struggling to find a file or waiting for a software to open gets me distracted and before I know it I’m back in bed avoiding the task. If I somehow manage to start the task because I have everything set up and it’s going smoothly my body literally will make me feel the need to shit, pee, get thirsty, feel cold/hot just so I can have an excuse to get up and delay the task more.

It usually ends decently I’ve never failed an assignment but have gotten a passing grade once as a result of procrastination so it always feels like I can get away with it. Im not bad at the school either the work I do is usually of good standard after all this so sometimes it really really bugs me knowing how much better I could do when I don’t get the high grade I want or knowing how I could have gotten this grade minus the breakdowns and hits to my mental health if I managed my time better. Every time I don’t get the grade I want I also get very easily discouraged and just think that I’m either just dumb or bad at the work that it hinders my potential or any chance of really trying.

 If anyone has this same issue and can help with any advice or suggestions please feel free.

Edit: Grammar",This is EXACTLY what's going on with me. Looking forward for suggestions.,"I just started posting on here, but first off to the tool who said ""stop acting like a baby"" that dudes an idiot who doesnt understanding the anxiety you are probably experiencing at finishing tasks. 

  
First off, its totally normal to experience the kind of anxiety that you are and trying to figure out how to fix it is super commendable. I would say, as someone who is 33, that the importance of trying to address this ASAP can't be understated. Synapses that fire together wire together, so the longer this happens the harder it is to break - so treat it as important as that. 

  
I read several books saw alot of therapists, yada yada - what really spoke to me was atomic habits. And basically what he preaches is measurement and incremental improvement. This isn't going to change overnight. Nothing I say, or anyone says, is going to make this go away tomorrow its a process at getting 1% better everyday. What I do is journal in the morning, make intention just write out all my thoughts, write my todo list and do journaling checkins at 2PM, 5PM, 8PM. When you fail at some of the todo list items, like writing your paper, try to ask yourself why. Study yourself, figure out how you could have made it gone differently? Could you have started with an outline, that slowly progressed? Could you have worked with another person? Write that as the test for tomorrow, and then try that. When that fails, keep trying. **Eventually** you'll find something that works for you. And you will relapse into another rut, what matters is not failing at a task, its showing up consistently with the process. 

&#x200B;

There are also therapists, coaches, doctors, etc. What I would say about medication is try to use it as a crutch with the intent of just supporting the healthy habits and getting off at some point but to each his own."

The reality is life is mostly difficult and you will need to rely on perseverance when motivation fails you. 

Perhaps you can break up your goals into smaller goals to feel a sense of accomplishment. Learn three chords, learn a song, learn how to pick a song, and therefore you are a basic guitar player! 

Another thing you can do to improve endurance or perseverance is to keep going for an extra 10 minutes when you feel bored/disengaged/or otherwise feel like stopping and keep increasing the times or amount of time you extend your working ‘streak’. 

There is no quick fix to discipline, it is hard work, perseverance, and a sense of accomplishment with each step or goal you’ve met. I wish you well! Keep on keeping on.","""[...] rely on perseverence when motivation fails you.""

I’m a 31-year-old man and I’ve reached a point where I’m at my wit’s end and I just don’t know what’s wrong with me or what to do.

I’m just going to list the big issues in my life and hope that someone can offer up some advice. Here goes:

* **I’ve never been able to finish a degree.**  

   * I’ve started and dropped out of three courses since I was 18.
   * I’ve finally made it through \*most\* of a law degree. I have just 6 months remaining (after taking a 2-year break) but cannot bring myself to study AT ALL.
* **I constantly feel exhausted and low in energy.**  

   * I’ve felt “sluggish” my whole life. I process information and learn slowly, I’ve never been able to just get sh\*t done.
   * I have serious sleep issues and can rarely fall asleep before 3am.
   * Even when I can get a decent sleep, I wake up feeling unrefreshed.
   * My weight has fluctuated a fair bit my whole life. I'm pretty fat now and despite eating very healthy I can't lose any weight this time.
   * I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve been trying different meds for almost 2 years but nothing has made a difference.
* **Zero motivation**:  

   * I have a full-time job (I’m studying part-time) and I constantly feel on the verge of being fired because I’m hopeless at deadlines and have no motivation to do the work they pay me to do.
   * I have big dreams but just feel too lazy to achieve anything. I want to do well and meet my goals so much, but something is holding me back and I just feel paralysed.
* **I feel socially weird**  

   * Work meetings, for example, are a huge source of anxiety - even though people seem to think I’m normal and outgoing. I have the same issues with attending classes.
* **I constantly feel like the dumbest person in the room**  

   * I have a reputation got being smart and everyone seems to think I’m smart, but I feel like I’ve just fooled everyone because, to be honest, I feel like I don’t understand things 99% of the time.
* **My apartment and my finances are a f\*\*king mess**. My bedroom is disgusting (to the point of being unsanitary) and I have debt collectors after me.

Thanks so much :)","Hey, congratulations for expressing yourself, you can be proud of you. That's not an easy thing to do. In my opinion, you lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. Only you can know why and how to improve it. You'll find what's best for you. To know what's best, you have to compare, in order to compare, you have to try different things. Pick what works for you, leave what doesn't. 

But remember that you become what you do, only actions are effective. And if you feel like not having the will power to try something you have never tried, it's either you evolve trying, or you remain the same. But you can't expect different results by repeating the same actions.

From the sound of this post though, it seems you ruined your attention span. Try to remove distractions and force yourself to finish things.

You just need to deny your brain the instant dopamine rush it’s craving for awhile. Eventually it’ll reset.","Try to improve without trying. Sounds silly but you t works.

Start reading or studying without too much intention of it. Start with 5mins and gradually increase it to hour over the period of 1 to 3 months. Your objective should be simple. Just want to do the activity without any expectation of remembering it.

Once routine is set then instead of increasing time, focus on remembering just 1 line or 1 small information for few hours. Revision that information on weekly bases. 

Once you can do 1 line easily then increase to 2 and so on.

May Take time for this entire activity so don’t expect any significant improvement knowledge wise but it will improve your focus and clarity by 1000 times.

I don’t want to mention what else you will get from it else you will start measuring that so just go with the flow. In year time you will know what you achieved with it.

Usually once you’re there starting then you’ll feel like it, and putting less pressure on yourself helps.

Do you have any one you can meet up with to study with? Any book clubs you can join online to motivate you to read to not fall behind?

Having said this, I’m now becoming very aware of the influence they had on me. I come from a very low income family (multi generational poverty) and I am struggling to break through the conditioning. I see others in my family succumbing to it, and it’s scary. My favorite cousin is looking at serious prison time through a series of completely preventable situations because he’s not aware of how influenced he is. 

In my early 20’s if I hated a job, I would just quit. I was taught that “others” are the problem. I thought this was completely normal. I was discouraged from attending college. When I attended anyway and wasn’t doing well (had a toddler and was a single mom) I was encouraged to quit and “be a mom” instead. I was told college is for rich white kids and I was already too smart to need it. I listened. 

Growing up, I never witnessed anyone succeed at anything. My family was chronically homeless, in debt, and with gambling issues. I’m not just talking about my parents either. We moved around constantly due to evictions. My parents moved from job to job. They never had goals, were never financially secure, and in some cases dissuaded me from auditioning for things or joining teams at school because they didn’t want the additional expense. 

I was wildly naturally talented with zero support. I moved in with a friend in high school because my parents moved to another city and I loved the teams I was on and didn’t want to quit. Her family had money and I’m so grateful they helped support me.

Fast forward to my 30s. I have a good career, a loving partner, and my son has done well. Yet I cannot shake the urge to flee when things get difficult. I never realized it was unusual until now. I’m just now learning in my 30’s that the magic is in the day to day and I’ve totally sabotaged all of the success I deserve and worked so hard for by quitting too soon.

Even knowing this, I’m struggling in my pattern. I feel like I’m cycling. I’ll be doing well, something will knock me a little off course, and I completely shut down and am ready to give up. I hate that I’m like this. It means I’ll never reap the rewards of my monumental but unfocused efforts. I have definitely put so, SO much effort in. 

Has anyone dealt with fighting against weak conditioning like this? I could use advice.","Feeling like you're cycling does not mean you're actually cycling. In fact, based on your post it seems like you have successfully and against the odds built a great life yourself.

It's okay to relapse once in a while into old ways of thinking. By being aware, you already won 50% of the battle. When you feel like you're spiraling, double down in your self care, and remember that you have choice. And you can choose to be brave and know that your feelings may not reflect reality. You can choose to address intergenerational trauma head on. And in doing so you're setting an incredible example for your family. I don't think there's actually a way to never have the negative feelings come back, only empower yourself with the tools/ therapy to pull yourself out. And then over time, it gets easier. At least this has been my experience.","I really appreciate this. 

You are right - maybe those feelings never go away but can be used in a positive way…as a reminder."
t3_xc1fsf,[Need advice] Scared of making any attempt so I procrastinate,"So, what I’ve noticed is that I get very scared to do anything with studying or homework. 
I just get scared to even make an attempt at things… 

Usually, when it’s the day something is due, that fear of getting a bad grade overcomes that fear of making an attempt at doing things. 
It’s struggle though, and I end up hurting a lot. 

I’m just wondering about how I can just do things with school even if there is no due date to scare me into trying even though I get so afraid to (because I want to get things done earlier and not last second) 

I just don’t know how to get over that fear of doing anything at all, of even making an attempt…..

It’s not that I just want to play games or do something else, it’s just fear of doing it at all…..","I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.

In my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams 

Firstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% 

So whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. 

If you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. 

Now you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. 

Good luck bro , you can do it.","Pretend you are playing an acting role, or are controlling a robot, and your character/bot puppet is studying or doing whatever project. They are miserable, but getting on with it, putting in a C+ effort.

Sometimes making it a weird game like this works for me, or at least just accepting it's going to be miserable at first like like jumping in a cold pool, or telling myself giving 75% of my best effort is fine. Usually end up  going beyond that after getting into the groove of it."

It's to the point where I can go to the mirror every hour and see at least one new open wound, glistening red and seeping liquid. Coagulated blood's under my fingernails. I wear a KN95 mask just to hide the scars and wounds and say it's because of COVID.

My family scolds me over and over about this issue of mine, to no avail. I still scratch. There are scars up to a year and a half old.

t3_y3kxaz,[Need Advice] Struggling Working from Home,"I'm an engineer at a salaried job where not much is expected of me. I have deadlines to meet every 3 weeks. I have about 30 hours worth of work to do over the course of those 3 weeks whenever I want. This is a HORRIBLE system for a procrastinator.

I literally do nothing for 2.5 weeks. I ride bikes/train 15 hours a week, I play video games, I play chess, I watch youtube, I watch netflix. Anything except work. The dread of the deadline is always hanging over me. I hate the office work so much and it brings on an incredible amount stress when I'm trying to complete a 30 hour report in 2 days.

I travel 25% for this job and travel weeks are 40 to 60 hour work weeks. I find that to be so much more satisfying and less stressful. The travel is one of the few reasons I haven't left yet. It's crazy that I enjoy working 60 hours a week, living out of a hotel, more than working 10 hours a week from home.

I wake up everyday and I have an easy list of work things I want to complete that day. Every night I go to bed completing none of it and the stress continues to build for the next day. Then miraculously when I know I have no more time, I find the energy to work two 15 hour work days in a row. I seriously need help. I can't live like this anymore.","I have a spreadsheet, which has all of the tasks I need to do for a project and percentages next to each task. It tells me what area is the least completed, and I go straight to that task and do it until I’m bored. Then I log my progress and get a little shot of joy from seeing the grand total creep up by 1%. You can play mind games with yourself, like “first I’m going increase the overall percent by 5% then go for a walk, then nail 2%.”","I was let go from my job this morning for this exact reason. Admittedly, I reached the point where I was falling so far behind that I wasn't able to keep up, even with huge bursts of productivity. My boss said that I had not been consistent with my work or communication and that I did not give the impression that work was a priority for me. 

I had seen it coming for a while now, and yet I could not will myself to sit down and catch up enough. I was stressed first from the work, then from my procrastination, and finally from the social anxiety of not wanting to face my failure.

But when I finally got the call and was terminated, I honestly just felt relieved. I knew I was burnt out and feeling isolated, and I knew that it was affecting my work ethic as well as my mental health. I think it is also a wake up call for me, and maybe I am just someone who needs to be in office in order to focus. No shame in that, everyone is different. I love the idea of wfh and wish I could have made it work, but I just lost all motivation.

I stopped doing any sort of self care or dressing in anything but sweatpants. I left my extremely toxic job in March and have bounced around dead end jobs since then. The only positive thing I have done for myself recently was to go back to school - but even that is challenging. (It is only week 2 and I already missed a class because I woke up with a migraine and just felt extremely lethargic) I have become the Queen of excuses and I can't stand myself anymore.

t3_t9ww1o,[Need Advice] Getting disciplined is making me miserable,"I (27f) have struggled creating and maintaining healthy habits my whole life. I used to pretend that living a healthy lifestyle wasn't necessary but as I got older I gained weight and developed GERD as a result of the weight and decided it was time to make a change and failed many many times. I only need to lose about 25 pounds but its been tough. For context I also work a semi stressful job that usually leaves me feeling emotionally drained by the end of the workday. 

Recently I read Atomic Habits, and it really helped me set small goals that I've been very consistent with. The issue is that I feel like im losing all the things that made me happy and I just feel miserable despite making good progress on my goals. I love going out for food and I enjoy having some wine after work and with dinner to wind down. My new routine doesn't really allow for these things as I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit. I still allow myself to have these things but in moderation, so think twice a week or so. 

When I resist the temptation to go out for food or get alcohol I don't feel happy about it, I just feel annoyed that I cant do the thing that makes me happy. When I cave and do these things anyways I feel happy in the moment but then feel bad about it after. Being in a caloric deficit also make tired and cranky overall so most days after work I just feel tired and drained and I don't feel like I even enjoy my hobbies anymore.

Is this a normal adjustment to a new routine? Will it go away eventually?

Ty","I am right there with you fighting the same battle. The only things helping me move forward (slowly) are these 3 things:
1. I deleted all social media beside Reddit. No Tik Tok, no Instagram, no Facebook- nothing that will allow me to mindlessly scroll. It has actually caused me to pick up a book and read. 
2. When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself “What is something small I can do right now?”. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I’m not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in 1 go, but I have at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something. 
3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud “Don’t put it down- put it away.” This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. 

Maybe these will help you move forward. It’s a small start.

Also, the book Atomic Habits is slowly but surely changing my life and making even these tiny gains happen. I recommend running to get it. Before I started to read it, I wondered if maybe I was depressed. And truthfully, maybe I still am. But this book is helping me realize that it is not a lack of goals or motivation that is my problem, it is a lack of good systems in my life.

You’re so young, and have so much ahead of you. 19?!  Dude you’re better off than I was at that time, and your feelings resonate. 

You clearly have recognized you don’t like this current version of yourself. 

Step 1 accomplished. Recognized the problem. Winner. Boom not a loser.

Step 2 address the problem, change . This is hard, but you seem motivated and therefore you can do it. Just tell yourself you can. Identify and move away from situations and people that hold you back from improving. Even if just temporarily.

Try and get a new perspective - move, or if you can’t, reorganize your living space. 

Throw out everything that reminds you of the things you don’t want (bongs, sell your video game consoles, clothing, art, all of it). 

Take some time and think about your future, what you want to do, what kind if life you want to have. 

Picture who you want to become, tell yourself you are that person and act like that person as best you can. 

Nobody is perfect and you WILL revert sometimes, but even if at first its two steps forward and one back, eventually it will be 20/30/40 steps forward and one back.

You will wake up one day years from now and be amazed st how far you’ve come. Start with the two steps today and go from there. 

Set small goals and hit them. 

Make your bed EVERY DAY.  Can you do that? Of course. Every day you do that you are accomplishing something, even if nothing else you wanted to do gets done, or you played video games or pulled the pickle, whatever. 

You still made your bed. 

You will be reminded at night before you go to sleep and you can do it again tomorrow. Its a small thing, but the feedback loop reminds you of your overall goal of self improvement. 

Read books, read some self improvement ones. Listen to inspiring podcasts and speakers. Lots of them felt the way you did before turning it around and becoming successful. David Goggins, Andrew Huberman, James Clear, Stephen Covey, are all good. 

Find the bits and pieces that work for you and incorporate them into your life. 

Good luck! If you want specific suggestions or questions - holler. 

You got this.","Hey, i started working on myself when I was 19 and I’m now approaching 26. You’re soo young and have so much time to make changes in your life.

t3_10ov3e5,[need advice] I need help becoming disciplined. Even when I know the outcome will make me happy if I get up and do what needs to be done I still will let my mind bounce around and never actually do the task at hand. Tasks typically being studying or working out.,,"This is a problem that virtually everyone comes across at some point in their lives. I advise that you follow these general rules
1. the 60 second rule: if you catch yourself procrastinating, tell yourself that you will just work for 60 seconds. afterwards, it will be significantly easier for you to continue working.

2. the two minute habit rule: slowly integrate studying and exercise as habits in your life. however, when you start, you may get a surge of motivation and do too much. if you do this, you will burn out. instead, start by doing the habit in under two minutes a day, and build it up from there. instead of trying to do a full workout routine every day, just do 90 seconds worth of push-ups a day.

3. meditate daily: one of the habits you integrate should be mindfulness meditation. it will allow you to recognize when you are procrastinating faster, and it will make it easier for you to resist the procrastination.

4. the two day rule: some days you just won’t do a habit. it happens. maybe something came up, or you just had a bad day. when this happens, just don’t let it happen two days in a row, or the habit will begin to fade.

5. don’t beat yourself up. progress comes slow, and as i mentioned before, this is something everyone experiences.","I would say break things down into manageable chunks. Best advice I’ve ever gotten. 

I was in the military and was trying to get into special forces. The workouts were long and brutal. Four hour pool sessions. 

For repetitions during push-ups, pull ups, burpees, etc knowing that you have 100 burpees ahead of you is daunting and if you think about it too much you will quit. But if you break it down into manageable chunks, you can keep going no matter what. For example when I knew I had 100 I would start knocking them out. Maybe 20 at a time. Then it would get hard so I would only focus on doing 10. Then 5. Then 2. Break things up into manageable chunks!

I apply this to my life in many ways. When I know I have dishes to clean, laundry to do, meals to prep, etc. I pick one, and start with it. Don’t think about the others. Just start! Once you finish one task that sense of accomplishment will build up. And you will move onto the next. 

You got it! You are capable! Good luck 🤙"
t3_xdxiuz,[Need advice] Has anyone successfully overcome or managed a schema against self-discipline?,"Turns out I'm not just lazy, it's not just my ADHD, it's not just that I was spoiled, I've got some sort of childhood-induced massive aversion to discipline as a concept, from within or without. We're talking beyond attitude and effort and willpower. It's cost me every job and hobby I've ever had and it's cost me the love of my life. 

As soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I've been a game developer for a decade and I've never finished a game. I've been playing musical instruments and singing my entire life but I've never managed to learn sheet music or any scales or arpeggios on anything. Believe me I have tried. The trying never lasts long enough. The shame is overwhelming.

I'm sick of not being good at anything. I'm sick of this abstract baseless fear ruling my life. How the fuck am I supposed to overcome a discipline aversion without discipline?! Has anyone conquered something this deeply rooted? What steps did you take?","I looked at how my life was going and instead of getting angry or resentful, I got motivated. I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on — as you seem to well know. 

I set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. 

Now, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I’m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.

I struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I’d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don’t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I’d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn’t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn’t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. 

You need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly. Accomplishing these small goals will build confidence, which inspires motivation, which is how you build discipline. That’s how I overcame the problem you’re having.","The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won't last. If hope is your motivator, it will. 

A big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks. If you get distracted, notice the task again and feel overwhelming shame it's hugely painful, so you avoid that feeling, therefore avoiding the task. Working through that shame, so that your able to notice the thing you forgot and just go ""oh, I did want to finish that"", that's the game changer. 

It needs to be ok that you stopped the task. (Which, spoiler, it is)

Societal ways of dealing with someone (both yourself and others) forgetful or easily distracted tend to involve making the person ""care"" enough about it, which means feel so bad about it you'll never do it again. You ever had that lector from yourself or others? This doesn't work in the long run and takes a LOT of dedication and time to overcome. 

It's not that you don't care, it's that you're wired to be distracted and forgetful. Just have to restart a few times, and that's ok."
t3_11f5i81,[need advice] Seriously- how do you beat social media addiction?,"Hey all- my life has changed for the better with the journey of self growth. I have quit smoking successfully, i read, workout, can be productive. The one thing holding me back from being 99% efficient is social media use. I have done a dopamine detox, i have definitely reduced my screen time these past few months. I try to delete the apps during the week. However i always find myself redownloading them and procrastinating while i KNOW consciously what i’m supposed to be doing.  I am off of tiktok and facebook, but snapchat and instagram are my weak points. 


I know i’m not the only one going through this, however i feel like i am missing out on communication even though i know i’m not.  I don’t have a huge social life at the moment and that is probably the problem. That being said- any advice/tips are welcome. It truly is an addiction - it’s wild!! Thanks all.","You don't really need to cut out social media completely from your life, in my opinion it's still required for socializing.

What you can do is try to find things to do that can keep you entertained and busy during the times that you usually want to pick up your phone. Busy hands are great to keep the phone away.

If you find yourself returning too much, then try to reduce the amount of stimulation you get from your social media. Avoid ""for you"" recommendations such as the explore tab on Instagram, and mute the stories and posts on friends who you don't really keep up with. It's ok to still look at what your friends are doing, but try to catch yourself before you go down the ""explore"" rabbit hole.

I've recently broken up with my ex and this is what I do to try and stop stalking their every move. Find other more productive things to distract yourself with and only keep up with those you really care about. Social media detox is hard, so it's better to make it easier one step at a time. Motivation is fickle when there is a high hurdle.","Here are a few things you can do. Also as boring as it can sound find something you want to learn about this way at least you are using that time to benefit you.

Adopt a “Digital Sabbath”: Schedule a day of the week when you refrain from using social media, digital devices and apps for 24 hours.  


Alternate your usage: Limit your engagement on social media to alternating days, or at least limit the amount of time you spend on it daily.  


Take advantage of tools like Screen Time which allow users to set limits on their app usage and can be used as reminders of how often they are engaging with social media.  


Practice mindfulness and be aware of emotions that may arise from engaging with certain content on social media platforms such as anxiety or frustration.  


Unfollow/unsubscribe from accounts that create feelings of envy or insecurity that may lead to higher engagement levels when viewing them.  


Aim for quality, not quantity: Instead of spending lots of time mindlessly scrolling through feeds, focus on having fewer but more meaningful engagements online with friends, family and acquaintances."
t3_zr6wn3,[Need Advice] How do I rewire my brain for discipline and creativity?,I am naturally lazy and I can't do anything. I always imagine myself doing things and vicariously live though other successful people but can't do anything for myself. What should I do? How do I change my brain to get out of this slump and actually make changes to my life?,"I'm also a naturally lazy af person. Which is why I'm using my computer and phone to speed up most of my processes. However, having tech in your hands will most of the time result into procrastination.

So this is what I did initially before rewiring my brain for discipline, creativity, and productivity -- I basically started identifying the activities I'm doing every day into 3 areas of my life:

- Career and Growth
- Health and Key Relationships
- Quality of Life

If an activity does not fit my main categories, there are 2 options for me. It's either:

- remove them completely in my life if I think it won't help reaching my goals
- or use them as a reward whenever I gain points from doing my daily activities -- Gamification System

I hope my experience helps in some way.",Your first problem is identifying yourself as “naturally lazy”. Good luck achieving anything with that mindset.
t3_twv6xx,[Need Advice] How do I prevent burnout from self-care?,"I've been very consistent and disciplined about the past 6 months. Early on, I read articles on preventing burnout and they said I need to eat healthier, drink water, etc. and so I prioritised those things. I also prioritised having a good social life, sleep, having a clean environment etc. But I was still experiencing burnout and I decided to do the bare minimum for a week and my personality had a radical change - I was much calmer, happier and rational. In other words, my burnout decreased significantly. That means it was these healthy things that were causing my burnout. How do I prevent burnout from taking care of myself?

Edit: Thank you all so much!","I think you may have fallen into the trap of toxic productivity, or the idea that you should be productive all of the time. Applied to self care that would be the idea that you have to always eat healthy, always sleep 8 hours a night, meditate everyday, etc. And those are very important, but you shouldn’t obsess about them. It’s okay to not do those things sometimes. It’s all about balance.","You pay attention to how you feel and what is happening for you in any moment, and you honour that. In my experience rest is the most important form of self care and also the most underrated in a society that is so focused on output. So, build in more time for rest, adjust your expectations of yourself when it comes to how much you want to get done and find ways to get what your body needs that aren’t creating more stress. 

Self care should never be about ticking boxes, it’s about learning to listen to yourself and using that information to determine what you need the most at that time. It could be rest, or social time or saying no to something - you don’t know until you stop and assess where you are right now.

Good luck OP 😊"
t3_10k9n0w,[Need Advice] what to do when traumatic memories put you in a funk and ruin your day and productivity?,"i’m recovering from severe trauma (in therapy) and some days are good, most are normal, but some are really bad. one traumatic memory or flashback is enough to ruin my whole day and productivity. one traumatic memory leads to another and soon there’s a whirlpool in my head and now i can’t study anymore. and even when the memories have stopped i can’t snap back to my previous mental state and temperament and the gross feeling in my stomach remains the whole day. how do i get out of this funk and not let my whole day go to waste?","This has been me for years and I think I’ve finally found a way to overcome this. As far as my story goes, I had a traumatic brain injury 12 years ago, followed by trauma with friends, family, roommates, employers… the whole shebang. But I’m an engineer, so I’ve spent the last 12 years trying to find a solution to all of my issues. Obsessed with it really. If you want tips on other approaches to handling trauma, like mindsets, routines, supplements, or life style, you can DM me and I’d be happy to offer some simple, small steps you could take to help in those areas too. 

But as far as the one thing that finally helped me get out of bed and stop playing minesweeper for hours on end is massaging my body. This relieved the build up of tension in my body, which eased the tension in my mind. 

This might sound antithetical to fixing your thoughts, but despite everything I’ve tried this is the biggest thing that’s calmed my thoughts. It makes perfect sense to me why it works too, but unfortunately it isn’t used a whole lot in the western world’s counseling. It’s picking up, but it’s still in its infancy. 

Anyway, the body and the mind are one thing: the brain and the nervous system. You notice how when you get nervous you tense up? Or when you get angry you have this build up of energy that makes you want to punch something? Or when you’re shy you just want to curl up in a ball? This is your mind telling your body how to react to these emotions… how to handle the energy behind these emotions… to release the build up of energy (anger) or to preserve the little energy you have left (exhaustion). 

But the nervous system is a two way street. Just as the mind can tell the body how to behave, the body can tell the mind how to behave. 

Trauma is a psychological condition that affects our entire nervous system. This explains the cramp you feel in your stomach. Our nervous system is what’s responsible for all of our organs. It’s what relays messages from the mind to your stomach to tell you you’re full, for example. So the traumatic thoughts you’re having and the tension you feel in your body are one illness. Helping one helps the other. 

As for how to massage, here’s my routine. I like doing things bottom up, step by step, but you can do it in whatever way feels comfortable for you. If my description is too much for you right now that’s ok, just start with the first one and you can slowly work in the other ones later at whatever feels comfortable for you. 

If you have a massage ball or anything you can roll on your skin that would help too, but it isn’t needed.  Some important notes are included. 

1. Feet. Start here. They have over 2000 nerves and are an important player in releasing tension. They’re what ground us to this planet and are what support our entire structure. 

2. Slowly work you’re way up each leg. You can do one at a time or both, it doesn’t matter. 

3. Once you’re up to the thighs, play close attention to your inner thighs. The sacral nerve is here and it’s a very important nerve to massage. It’s a main nerve that’s responsible for your bladder and rectal muscles. Massage will  especially help if you have diarrhea or constipation. 

4. Slowly work your way up the side of your torso and gently massaging your abdomen. Massaging your sides will help calm your vagus nerve, which is a main nerve responsible for digestion, heart rate, and immune system. Likely responsible for your stomach issues. 

5. Arms. Start by placing your hands on the opposite shoulder and giving yourself a hug. Give just a gentle squeeze and slowly work your way down your arms, to your wrists, and back up again. Do this a couple times if it feels comfortable and end by massaging the back of each shoulder. The gentle hug isn’t only good for your nervous system, but your psyche as well, often bringing us back to memories of being loved as a little kid, and receiving protection. 

6. Massage the sides of the neck. The vagus nerve runs through here and is a good spot to massage. 

7. The head. Slowly start from the bottom, working your way up to your scalp. The jaw often holds a lot of tension for a lot of people and is a really good spot to focus on. If you have real vagus nerve issues like I do, the ear area is a really good spot to focus on too, specifically the left ear. It’s where the nerve starts. Be gentle here. The ear:
1. Massage above the ear, gently moving the skin in whatever way feels comfortable. 
2. Place your finger in the ridge of your lobe, just gently moving around. It doesn’t take much movement here. 
3. Place your pinky finger inside your ear and very gently push against the back of your ear. 

You can finish massaging your scalp and you’re done! 

Notice how your thoughts are now. They should likely be much more relaxed. 

Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any.","thank you so so so much. that’s very helpful, i appreciate your time so much <3"

t3_uhpcm2,[Need advice] 22 year old anxious PTSD-ridden NEET trying to grow wings and quit being a manchild,"i'm 22 and i just, JUST started doing the laundry/dishes/showering/brushing my teeth daily, after 3ish years of literally nothing. my room got so fucked, i have no friends and shit work experience; however i have skills in writing (that's it) and i'm in good shape and conventionally attractive and that's about all i have going for me, if it weren't for these i'd be the man without a life from South Park. EDIT: actually, bonus, not an incel/supreme Redditor/4channer/porn addict, so i have some perks

i mean literally nothing, not even TV/video games, just almost pure catatonia. to make things short i had a really fucked up violent childhood, neglect, most of my family passed away including my mom (who OD'd in front of me when i was 16 and uhhh... yeah, that's mostly the reason why i am the way that i am now), bullying, exposure to drugs/alcohol and intimate partner violence/SERIOUS abuse, including a false accusation of S/A (she has BPD and conveniently forgot she consented to something after she found a Reddit post talking about her s3xual abuse at the end of the relationship)

my doctor prescribed me benzos at 15 and at 17 started taking them more and at 19 was hooked daily. i was done with life and COVID hit and i experienced some more trauma and decided fuck it and became an alcoholic drug addict NEET that didn't shower for weeks. i went to rehab and i'm still recovering and am sober but feel like i'm always going to be a fucking overgrown boy because i failed to adapt. 

if you haven't guessed there wasn't really another adult presence in my life (got handed over to an abusive adult girlfriend, basically) and my mom was always nodding off, like never really there for her last five years - i didn't learn anything, and skipped school but graduated with AP classes/high ACT score and somehow did 2 years of college, i missed a lot of development and i feel like i'll never be like everyone else, i don't like myself at all. and I don't want to make anymore excuses, i inherited the house and me and my NEET brother live alone and don't work, but he is still an addict

also yes i am in therapy, clearly. i have tried to kill myself before, but i feel hopeful now. i just feel like it's too late and i'll never learn good behaviors. :/

i remember one day i was going downstairs to my single bare mattress on the floor, with trash all around it, plates, rotting food etc. and it was all gone because my ex cleaned it all up. i needed hospitalized in a psychiatric unit at an earlier age, but was only able to get help this year.

i just don't wanna fuckin be this way anymore, such a sad pathetic existence.","Hey man, I'm not a licensed professional. But I do have someone in my life that ended up as a NEET. It hurts me so much when I think of him--because he is one of the smartest, most capable people I know. He also had trauma, and in his case he couldn't go out due to social anxiety.

&#x200B;

The first thing I would do is try to change how you view yourself. It seems like you are on the right track for that--taking care of your body and mind plays a big role in that respect.

&#x200B;

It's true that in life, connections and background get you far. You do need to put your foot in the door to move forward. But at the end of the day, you have to acknowledge that you are in control of your future. Yes, at this point it may be harder for you to make it than it would be for someone with tons of connections. But our hardships only mean something if we decide to take them lying down.

&#x200B;

I might recommend something--whatever you're trying to aim for, try and make incremental steps every day towards that goal. If for you that's a job, then apply to at least three-four jobs a day. No matter how shitty you feel while you're doing it(I know it can feel really intimidating), do it anyway. It may only take an hour or two. When you're done, not only can you acknowledge that you did something incredibly substantial in a short amount of time, you've just improved your chances of getting a job you want. If you want to go really hard, add on top of that--you have to cold-email/message someone at a company you want to work for. Do that, and you're a god.

&#x200B;

Keep a calendar in your room, and every time you finish your step for the day, cross off a date. Do everything you can to not break your chain.

&#x200B;

I like to hold this practice when doing something difficult for me--I count down from ten, and by the time I reach 0, I have to start the task. This gets rid of the anxiety associated with starting in the first place. This applies to social situations too--I count down from 5, and by the time I reach zero, I have to go interact with whoever I have to, whether that be a stranger, a cashier, or a long-time friend.

&#x200B;

When doing all of this stuff, it's okay to sometimes struggle through the tasks. Starting and showing up are more important. HOWEVER, IMO it's never okay to not believe in yourself. When you're filling out job applications, know that one day, you will get the job you're looking for. That doesn't mean never learn from mistakes, that means have faith in the process of progress. Small steps lead to big changes over time.

&#x200B;

I really hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. I'd recommend starting by doing something simple now, *right now*, like making your bed. See what difference it makes over time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, don't let the label of NEET define you. Yes, you are a 'NEET' right now. But tell yourself that you only need to take more chances. Being a NEET doesn't mean you can't succeed, and don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You need to get lucky. But luck comes to those who search for it. If you try enough times, even if your success is 1 in 100, you'll  likely get it after 100 tries.","thanks

i've been through a lot of really ridiculous shit, in a really short period of time that happened to be my developing years, enough for me to think i was a bad person and better off dead. now that i'm clear-headed i want a better future for myself, and while i don't think i should get life on easy mode due to my experiences, i think i deserve love and happiness. 

i'm wanting to go back to school, and i'm trying to take a lot of inspiration from people like Chris Gardner and my counselor in rehab who really overcame adversity - it makes me feel like there's hope for me. 

i just need to believe in myself, also lol never partaken in any criminal shit/been locked up, but looking at stories of successful ex-cons helps a lot. prison is a way lower place than where i am now, I've got this."

I’ve tried setting alarms so far but haven’t got anywhere.","A part of procrastination is an emotional response to the work you have to do. Do you think this may be to anxiety or nervousness about the work? It’s possible that you ignore the work because you’re feeling pressure (that you put on yourself) to complete it.

t3_we9g68,[Need Advice] Weed and Discipline,"So I (24M) have come to enjoy weed over the past three years quite a bit.

I consider myself a very disciplined person, even while smoking.

I have a full time job and a handful of rental properties as another source of income. I workout 4-5 times a week.

But I can’t help but feel guilty while smoking that I “could be doing more”. The reality is I feel that while doing anything other than grinding.

Weed helps me do the tasks at work or at my business that are boring or that I keep kicking down the road. 

Im proud of what I’ve accomplished and keep coming to the conclusion that if I can smoke weed and still get my tasks done for the day I shouldn’t be stressing too much about it.

But still after the initial high I feel guilty and start asking myself “Do you think your competition is high right now?” Even though I’m literally working while having that thought.

I’d love to hear what you guys think.","I know exactly what you mean and have dealt with this myself. 

Stop for a week or two and see how you feel. 

In my case, when I stopped smoking it definitely helped me be more productive. I still like to smoke at night after work, but find that I’m more productive (and less anxious) while working now.

Edit: also be careful with smoking too much, it can mask what’s “really happening” because it “feels” good to smoke. 

Recently I developed a stomach condition that I didn’t realize I initially had. Basically eating food has been hard, and I’ll throw up food almost immediately. Sorry if it’s TMI lol 

Point is, took me a while to figure out what was happening because weed was making it easier to eat. But was also aggravating my stomach more, and making the issue worse. 

So your body might be telling you something.  Stop for bit and see how you feel. Overall though, you really don’t want to be using weed to get by the “boring” stuff. Use it to enjoy the good stuff even more. Although it’s technically not an addictive substance, it can become habit forming.",A doctor didn’t need to tell me weed was making it easier to eat 😂 It was pretty noticeable when I wasn’t throwing up

Also, Merry Xmas and HNY to everyone.","There are a few things you can do.

First, what's the ambient temperature of your house? I'm not asking what it says on the thermostat, but instead what it actually is inside the house. You may consider raising the temperature a little.

Second, light is important. People design their offices for low energy and for being sleepy. Put in 100 watt natural daylight LED bulbs in your office space. You should have 2 or 3 of them. Turn up your monitor brightness. You might even consider putting your lights on a timer. I have the lights in my bedroom come on automatically right after 7:00. Again, I am using natural daylight hue and I have the brightest LED panel fixture I could get. When the lights come on, it's a bright sunny day. The light helps you to wake up.

Third, make sure you are getting decent sleep. You need to eat your meals and go to bed then get up at a consistent time every day - even the weekends. You want to aim for 8 hours.

There are a few other things.  A light, protein and fiber heavy meal first thing in the morning with a bit of coffee will really get you going. I'm talking 200 calories or less - something like a hardboiled egg, a protein bar, some lunchmeat, something like that. Absolutely no sugar or carbs though unless you want to have a blood sugar crash later.

It sounds to me also like you are having some dry skin issues. After showering, I would recommend slapping on some moisturizer. Use something water based. Apply daily everywhere, then to the exposed surfaces a few more times through the day, and to your hands after each time you wash them.","In addition to the temperature and lighting mentioned by other posters, consider taking vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency can make you tired and is usually worse during the winter. 

I'd also recommend getting checked for basic vitamin levels and thyroid etc by your doctor because your fatigue seems to be impacting your daily life. They can give you more specific recommendations and make sure you don't go overboard."
t3_oj721a,[Need Advice] Undergrad thesis due in 3 days,"This is my first post on here.

Background - I am in the final year of my undergraduate BA degree. I have always been a consistent student in all my previous semesters. Handed my assignments and term papers on time, Got mostly A's and sometimes B's, Managed to maintain an above average CGPA of 8.5 and above.

Situation right now - I have submitted all my assignments and papers for my final semester, except for a 10,000 word thesis which is due in 2 days. This was initially supposed to be submitted in May, but I got an extension as I could not submit it at the time. My grandmother, my parents and sister all got covid, and given everything that has been happening, I couldn't focus on any of my academic submissions. The quality of my submissions has also gone down, as I am aware. 
In the previous semester, I had also managed to submit my final papers a few weeks after I had a surgery and got A's in all of them, but I just haven't been able to do anything this semester.
This is probably the last extension I have gotten, and even now, I was not able to work at all. Neither did I have the motivation to, nor the willpower. I have also been having suicidal thoughts since the last 6 months, and I know that I am not okay.

Yesterday, I saw a lot my batchmates post on social media about their online graduation and that they finished their degree and I have been anxious ever since about failing now.
Our college won't provide the option of taking a break year and continuing, nor will I have support from my family, so I have to finish this, no matter what. After being so close, I don't want to give up, but don't know what to do because of my mental health.

Thesis work done: I have written around 4,000 words, done 80% of my research. I have 2 chapters left to write, and then editing and proofreading them.

Any advice, motivation or even personal experiences with similar University situations are welcome.
I know that everyone is going through a very difficult time right now, and I am probably in a much better environment compared to that.

Thank you so much!","You’ve got two days. 48 hours. You can do this. You say you’ve done 4000 words, you can finish this. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Seriously. It just has to be done. Maybe you won’t be able to proofread the way you normally would, or write it to a standard you’re used to. The fact is, and this is the most important part…you just have to sit down and do it. 

You can do this. 

The stress of not having it done, and not working on it while the clock is ticking away is causing you more distress. Honest fact. I have faith that you can do this. 

Sit down. Break up the next 48 hours into 12 chunks. In each chunk, write 500 words. Set a timer. When 500 is done, take a break, take a walk, stare at a wall. Whatever it takes. 

Put away phones and other distractions. Set yourself up and commit to writing the first 500 word chunk. You will feel better. 

You can do this.","Honestly...you're just delaying it even further. 

The time it took you to think of posting this and then writing it up would have easily got you over the half way point on your assignment.

There is no magic secret or sauce. The fact all your other assignments were on time means you're not a procrastinator at all. This is the final assignment and the fear and anxiety of this all being finished and real life after school starting had delayed you this far and because you sound like you're not used to last second work you're dealing with further delayism.

Only answer here is. Doing several back to back distraction free working sessions. With small breaks in between. Your Research is mostly done these focus work sessions will just put it all together. 

It's not going to do it itself. Reddit cannot give you motivation. Don't let anxiety and fear waste 4 years of hard work. 

Justttttt dooooooo itttttttt"
t3_10ix3h3,[need advice] How do you stop running or avoiding tasks that gives you anxiety?,"

Has anyone ever felt like avoiding situations or tasks that’s need to be completed but kept on avoiding because it gives you anxiety and suddenly get into the habit of proscnatation. I’ve been avoiding my college classes lately because my grades are bad despite the amount of work I do. I don’t understand how to be calm and stop being frustrating with any recent grades or assignments .
Easily getting overwhlemed and all I think and worry is about life and college and stuff but even I worry about my college academics in back of my head but I just keep on avoiding even though I regret every min of it. Sighs I feel mentally and emotionally exhausted","Honestly, the only thing that has ever helped me is facing the thing that I don’t want to do. You do that with whatever supports you need, but ultimately, taking the thing on stops the the anxiety. Even if you don’t finish the task at hand at least you chipped away at it and now the job is smaller than it was before. 

I’m sure you’ve seen all over this sub that procrastination is a form of escapism. It’s true, and as you know from experience, it’s usually because we want to avoid feeling bad. **The truth is you will feel badly in this life.** You have to choose if the bad feelings are going to be because of fear/anxiety or because your going through the growth process.

I’m a school teacher who also has anxiety. School is hard. Remember, you’re not the only person to struggle in school and it has absolutely nothing to do with your value or your future that you’re finding college challenging. 

I tell my students all the time that learning hurts. You can do it anyway. Come up with a plan to make things surmountable then enact any strategies that help you along the way. There is nothing wrong with using supports (friends, tutors, study groups, YouTube videos that break subjects down more clearly than professors etc). The idea is that you get to the finish line. **Take control and choose your pain.**  

All of that said, talk nicely to yourself and don’t feel like you need to have everything perfect right away. Life, learning, coping etc are all processes. Be reasonable with yourself.","It's painful to sit and study. But it's more painful to not study and slip into anxiety for not having finished the tasks. You choose your pain based on what's less painful. You take the easy way out. To me, the pain of discipline hurts less than the pain of regret. Choose wisely."
t3_11dy1f0,[Need Advice] How to be concentrated when working from home?,"It is always a lot of distraction when I am working from home. My kid, my husband, food, cat... I use pomodoro method for 25 mins, but it is always something distractive and I can't concentrate. Please advice.","Changing your environment is the biggest factor, like converting an out of the way room or closet into an office.

Noise-cancelling headphones also help.","Have a designated area where you only to work. Isolate yourself from all distractions - sights, phones, passersby. Set Focus Hours on your phone if you can. Schedule out your work for the day at the beginning of the day. Make sure your husband knows that you're ""at work"" during these times.

Try a standing desk - I get lethargic sitting all day. Find a type of music that focuses you. Get solid sleep, eat well, and drink water. If your mind refuses to focus, do some exercises for 5 minutes - it will increase blood flow and the brain can actually burn lactic acid for energy. Edit: the brain doesn't burn it, it actually triggers norepinephrine, which is a hormone that encourages focus, affects our stress response, improves memory, and relates some bodily functions that can become distractions (bathroom, hunger). So first, get moving. Format exercise, dancing to music while working, 5 quick crunches and push ups, anything. Reading this journal entry, lethargy shifts you to  essentially half-asleepness.

Take stringent notes on what you're distracted by, then chill out and reflect on that list to find ways to intercept those distracted spirals, prevent the distractions in the first place, or set up some ""give and take"" to not go full cold turkey.

Ultimately you may need to see someone if it doesn't improve. I was diagnosed with ADHD ""inattentive type"" - though always suspected it - last year at 32. Fuck do those stimulants help. Being out of a ""work only"" location was a tough adjustment.

t3_v5paqq,[NEED ADVICE] I cannot stick to exercising because I end up prioritizing other things,"Hi! So I'm currently coursing my last year of med school and throughout my career I've tried to make exercising a habit, but sometimes I have to go to the hospital or I have long shifts of classes/practices and I end up really tired and end up losing my streak of workouts.

I actually enjoy exercising! Since the pandemic started I discovered I enjoy exercising at home, so that's not really the problem. 

The main problem is that sometimes I have so many things to do or I'm so tired that I justify the fact that I do not have the time or energy for exercising. It's frustrating because sometimes I've been working out for a whole month and then I have a week of exams and quizzes so I stop working out to study and then it's so hard for me to get back on track and it takes me from 2-3 weeks to start exercising again :( This has been going on for years and I have never really known what to do. 

Any advices would be really appreciated :-)",Do it first thing in the morning. It will give you energy for everything else.,First thing in the morning.

I read, but I hate sitting down for so long. All I do is workout and read. How am I supposed to see results from working out, if I’m inactive whenever I don’t. How can I stay productive","Have you considered... Boredom?

I'm being 100% serious here.

The entire concept of having to be productive all day every day is incredibly unhealthy in the long term. Allow yourself to be bored, it is incredilby healthy to let your brain sit in boredom for a bit, just be sure to keep doing what you do in regards to work/workout/reading.

You could also consider some sort of craft. Maybe woodworking? Repairing something? Building a guitar from scratch?

Maybe some kind of art, learning an instrument, learning a new skill like voice acting, etc.","I’m going into junior year, but my schools already out. And I need to gain muscle, since I’m way too skinny"
t3_13h0gds,Waking up earlier [Need Advice],"
Hi, I’m looking to be more consistent with the gym but going to the gym after work is a nightmare my energy levels are way to unpredictable. I want to be a 5 am gym girly but I’m not sure how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you 🌻","This kind of change generally requires two types of discipline. You'll need to consistently get up early, but you'll also need to consistently go to bed early.

Most adults need to consistently get 7 or more hours of sleep per night. It's not unusual for someone to need 8-9 hours of sleep to feel fully rested. If you start getting less sleep than usual because you're waking up at 5 am without going to bed earlier, it's very likely to cause problems. Feeling tired during the day is just one of them. Lack of sleep may impact your mood, decision-making skills, creativity, and other abilities.

It can also be difficult to sleep well if you make a big change to your sleep schedule all at once. You might be more successful if you shift your sleep schedule 15 minutes at a time over a period of days until you're waking up as early as you want.

It also helps to keep a consistent sleep schedule. It will probably be easier to wake up consistently at 5 am if you're on the same sleep schedule every day, instead of only waking up early on certain days. It's not a problem to stay up a bit late or sleep in every once in a while, but a consistent sleep schedule tends to be easier to maintain.",Thank you so much for sharing this advice with me 🌻. It helped me understand why when I tried last month to do this I became very irritated throughout the day and sluggish. I’ll try the 15 minute interval changes and set a bedtime that actually works
t3_1211oiz,[Need Advice] How do I stop going to bed to lay down every time I am home.,"Every time I go home, I would only be able to do around 30 to 40 minutes of school work before getting tired and ""resting"" indefinitely  in my bed, scrolling social media or etc. After that I don't get up as much and just stay there until I fall asleep thus I don't get anything done most of the time. When I do stay on my desk for some time I get some work done but mind always think that I can do some work while laying down, only for me to do other things.",Laying down is not the issue here. Lay down without the phone. Let your eyes and brain rest. Leave your devices far from the bed.,I’ll tell you its the phone 100%. If you just lay and rest when you have rested (say like 30 min) you’ll get bored and want to do stuff. If you dont instantly start abusing your dopamine with a phone/pc etc I guarantee you youll get bored enough to even kinda want to do school work. Maybe not the first day but as soon as the second day already you might be so bored that you’d rather do your school work than nothing
t3_qy8khj,[Need Advice] I need help as I am in my late 20s and feel that my best years are already over.,"I (26, M) used to run half marathons during my college days but four years since graduation, I am an obese, lazy being. Over the years, I have tried to get back into running numerous times, but I feel that my body had peaked a long time ago and my physique is on a constant decline. I still want to lose weight and get fit, if necessary by other means, but I do not have the energy to carry out extensive internet researches for plans, apps and guides. I also struggle with maintaining a healthy diet as I tend to overeat and sleep, everytime I am going through an anxiety attack or depressed.

What do I do to help myself?","This reminds me a lot of myself from a few years ago. 

You shouldn't take this as medical advice, but for me it helped to seek help from a psychiatrist who then diagnosed me as suffering from depression and anxiety, and prescribed anti-depressants (a low dosage of citalopram balanced me out after a few weeks).

Anti-depressants were a temporary measure, though, and caused me to gain even more weight (I went from 100 kg to 117kg), so I had to start exercising. Over the last year I lost that extra weight and built up muscle due to regular exercise. I go for a 1h swim six times a week nowadays, but at the start I was barely managing 20 minutes and swimming less then 0,5 km. I swim 2,7km in 1 hour now. 
I'm also off anti-depressants now and I am in the best shape of my life (though I'm not done yet). 

My advice? Start exercising now. Do whatever you can, and do as little or as much as you can.

Don't feel like running? Walk.

Can't walk much? Then walk for 5 minutes.

Do crunches or push-ups at home. Can't do more than one? Then just do the one.

Whatever you do and no matter how little you do, just do it, and do it everyday. This alone will make you feel better.

Don't push yourself too hard, though. You will fail if you try to run marathons now. 
Aim to run marathons in a couple of years. 
Be patient with yourself. 
Be kind to yourself.

And if you can, seek professional help. Find a therapist. Practice mindfulness. And keep up hope.

You are in your late 20s. I am nearly 40 and I truly feel like my best years have just begun. 

You have all the time to achieve whatever you set your mind to. Just as long as you don't give up and are patient with yourself. 

There is no easy way. But there is a way, and it's yours. So go. 

Good luck and godspeed. I don't know you, but I believe in you and I'll be rooting for you.",Thank you so much for taking the time out to write an exhaustive message. I'll surely try to structure my thought process to align with my physical output in a better way.
t3_12k7iil,[Need Advice]I cant even get myself to work 3 hours a day consistently.,"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work. The first two days I did will and actually worked for 4 hours. But by Wednesday i couldn’t even get myself to work more than an hour. I spent so much energy forcing myself to work that day and I couldn’t do it. Almost like I was constipated mentally.

Should I lower down the work hours (even tho 3 is so small). And try to gradually increase the minimum time working? Or is it because I just don’t care enough about this business I’m working on. I’m amazed how people can work 6 hours a day of pure focused work. Sometimes I think there’s something wrong with me.

When it comes to gym, eating healthy I can see those benefits immediately right after and feel good. But with work I feel like shit after and I don’t really care about making bank. I do feel good sometimes but for the most part its a chore that makes me dislike life more.

Thank you!","Look up Atomic Habits. The real goal right now is to just convince yourself to show up to your work setting and not worry about how long. Maybe a few times a day to return. Maybe you get some in, maybe not. But good chance while you're at it without the pressure you will.

Next make it fun, find something to reward yourself ONLY when you do some work. That's it. The only time. Associate it with doing the Thing (work) and you'll enjoy work a bit more knowing what you get out of the deal","Start so small that you laugh at it, do it for a week, increase by 10min, do it for a week, rinse & repeat until you’re at your goal of 3h. It’ll take longer but it’ll be a habit.

You can also look up the pomodoro technique, think of ways to make it fun (reward yourself etc but not every time), have a deal made with someone that you pay them £xx.xx or donate to something you dislike if you miss 2 days in a row or 2 days from the same week. We can work a lot better with a drive to do it (the fun part) and a drive to not miss it (the punishment of losing money/whatever you decide).

Try to make sure you enjoy the work you’re doing too if you’re lucky enough to be in that situation, definitely helps a whole lot!

EDIT: Forgot to mention finding out ‘Why’ you’re doing this work, what drives you? Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you’re having a bad day and ask yourself “what the f am I doing this?” Your brain replies with the answer and continue."

3. I exercise regularly (5-6 times a week, mostly running)
4. I dont drink coffee after lunch, so i drink about 0.5l before 14pm
5. I prepare everything i need in the morning before going to sleep (meaning, I plan and prepare what im going to eat, prepare coffee, prepare clothing im going to wear and basically everything i need)
6. I read before sleeping (I read allot)
7. 15mins before falling asleep, I visualize my morning routine in my head a few times
8. I have an alarm on my phone and an alarm clock, which i both hide across my room

So far, statistically, i wake up as planned (so at exactly 6am) about 70% of the time. Also, today i tried the Alarmy app, (its an alarm app for waking up, when you wake up you have to solve a puzzle or some math problems before you can turn the alarm off) and it worked very well.

You’re probably bored and struggling to find meaning in tasks. *you are not lazy.* 

There is no correct way to compete a task. There is s way they will work for you and your brain. 

You don’t need to clean your room, you need to get it cleaner than it was five minutes ago. 

Do you like to sort things? Gréât. Get lots of storage tubs and work on just keeping clothes sorted. Don’t worry about folding or hanging clothes- just keep them off the floor and in some kind of container. Do you have trash everywhere? Get a kitchen trash can so you can throw paper and trash away immediately. 

Set a recurring alarm on your phone so you remember to wash your clothes and sheets once a week if you need to. 

Don’t vacuum. Get a dust buster and spot clean in the middle of the night. Keep paper towels and windex on your bookshelf or in your closet so you can clean off surfaces when you catch a glimpse of the bottle. 

Are you procrastinating your boring  ass work? Tidy up your room instead (I’m biased in saying this. I don’t like cleaning but I love organizing things and lining all my things up so when I get fidgety, I’ll organize.)

Don’t take a shower. Take a sponge bath (washcloth and soap on your pits and crotch, maybe wash your hair) in the sink and change your underwear. There. You’re cleaner than you were 5 minutes ago. Brush your teeth while you’re at it. Might as well. 
Go to therapy for grief. 

Self medicating isn’t great; but brains and neurodivergent brains crave stimuli so I get it. Chemical dependencies aren’t great though, and tou don’t want to accidentally start going to drugs and alcohol every time you feel a bad emotion. I would suggest that at the very least, you journal your feelings and work on being self aware of your triggers and the feelings that make you want to comfort yourself with drinking and weed. 

You *can* discipline yourself but I will tell you, it’s very very very hard to discipline yourself while also experiencing pain and grief and trauma. You need a break.

One of the habits I really want to change in myself for a longer period of time.,"Moderation.  Make the goal easier.  Youre dissapointing yourself too much by going ill never have any ever. 

You start by making more specific goals like: im only allowed junk/snacks x amount of times per week","I am a big emotional eater and junk food is my weakness. A couple things have helped me tone it down. 

Find less junky food you can eat instead. For example, I have apple chips that I’ve gotten into as a potato chip replacement. They’re sugary, sure, but better than the potato chips I used to mindlessly eat instead. Once you find a good healthier snack alternative, work your way up to healthier snacks or lower frequency of snacking from there. Starting small will make it much more approachable and you won’t feel like you’re punishing yourself. It’s okay to like food. Nothing morally wrong about it. No reason to make yourself feel guilty for it. Just keep trying to put better stuff in your body for fuel. 

This may not be applicable to you. But if you smoke weed or drink every night, try to stop doing that. Both of those things make me want to mindlessly eat, and I wake up with swollen fingers from all the garbage I consumed the night before."

I have $12000 saved up. I didn't save the next month, it doesn't put my savings back to $0. I know it's a crude example but it applies to any habit you want to form and messing up once doesn't put you back at square one. Applies to anything really: meditation, journaling, exercise, etc.

sorry for quick answer lol. My motto (or someone's else) is to put one foot in front of another. You'll get there.",">I have complete control over everything  
>  
>yet I still find myself stuck in old habits

Apparently you don't have complete control. Your pleasure seeking self has some control, your lazy self has some control, you all have some control together.

It's important to create feedback loops. There is a 100% chance that you won't get everything right on your first try. Therefore create mechanisms to constantly correct your plans. There are PDCA cycles, there is scrum, there is journaling. Choose whatever you like, but make sure it lets you create working feedback loops.

Also, don't use brute force. Find good enough reason for everything you do so you don't have to use force.

3) If you set ambitious goals you won't make 100% of what you planned on most days. It's ok. Get used to not being perfect.

>I guess I dont really have a ""why"" for all this nor an end goal, all I know is that I just want to be better and improve what I can

You need to rectify this, because if you don't know where you are going you won't get there. There are many ""being betters"". One may want to get rid of fat to live longer but in other circumstances one may want to put on fat to live longer (famines happened many times in history). So think about and write down your specific objectives first."
t3_v9ymcq,[Need Advice] I can’t get anything done even if I have the thought of it.,"I have all these dreams and ambitions of all the things I want to do or how my life to be but when it comes to actually doing it, I just give up. I already know some of the things that I could easily do but my brain makes them much more daunting and “more work” than it actually is and then I get tired or bored and just get on Tiktok or my video games. I just don’t know how to change my mind and start doing these things to get better. I feel like I’m slowly losing my joy.","As someone with ADHD+Anxiety, also past substance abuser, this is hella relatable. Not saying you have ADHD or Anxiety just that this is like default operating mode with ADHD and sometimes anxiety, also similar to the patterns in being addicted to something.

Problem is, you probably do know how to change your mind and start doing these things, it’s just that some base level networking in your brain is telling you ‘that will take too long to feel good, so do THIS which will make you feel good right now’ and you’re LETTING it run your life, at least for now. 

It’s not like you’re gonna wake up tomorrow and change it all, but based on a pretty simplified understanding of how brains work; the more you do one thing, the more your brain gets wired to do it. So just start small, be willing to FORGIVE yourself when you fuck up, and remember that it takes time to accomplish any goal. It wouldn’t be a ‘goal’ if you could just do it right now and be done with it. 

Based on that, the best course of action IMO is to accept “yes I’m addicted to shit I don’t like, and I want it to change, but it’s not gonna happen overnight, so I’ll start small”. So if you’re 100% stuck doing the things you don’t like today, tomorrow try and force yourself to do 5% of the things you want to do, and accept that you’ll probably do 95% tiktok and time wasting. Then work towards 10%. Then 20%, and so on and so forth. Overtime, you’ll start building some fucking discipline and drag yourself out of the dopamine seeking hellhole that it sounds like your living in. 

It’s great to aim high over the long term, and maybe you will get there, but for the short term, lower your expectations, and aim for mediocrity, then once you’ve gotten there, start aiming a bit higher each time, just slowly increasing your ability to sustain motivation, determination, and focus at a pace that is OK FOR YOU! Everyone is different, so don’t worry about how long it takes you, just take things one day at a time, or even one hour at a time, and chip away at using video games and tik tok slowly. Just remember those things have no ‘tangible gains’ they are all just fleeting moments of distraction and contentment, just temporary distractions from feelings of unhappiness and lack of content with life. 

When I wanted to turn off the world around me, I would get high, turn to the bottle, blast the music, just to temporarily feel good so I could ignore alll the things that made me feel bad. It’s been nearly 4 years since then, and I still have shitty coping mechanisms to ignore the things I’m not working on and know I need to be, but overtime I’m getting better at it, and maybe somewhat closer to letting any joy in life slip entirely through my fingers.","When you *actually* want to do those things more than your Tiktok and games ... you will.

t3_tcbq0o,[Need Advice] I know what it feels to have a winning mentality but i just cant keep it consistent. Please Help,"Ok so, the past 5 years ive learnt alot about myself. And the most important thing that I've learnt is that i have a winning mentality that goes and comes. However, i am in no control over this winning mentality and how to zone in and zone out of it when needed. 

To explain a little bit more, i want to tell a little about my performances, them being academic. 
In my high school, i had no mentality and was little cocky and over confident. Got less than average grades. Couldn't get accepted in a good college. And had to study for my first year of college by MYSELF and give exams as an individual privately, which is an option for failures like me. I don't know how to say it but it felt like a fuse just lit up in me and i was fucking studying hard. Turns out, that was my best performance ever. I had the best possible grade in all of my first year college exams studying by myself. Immediately, after that i got into a college for my second year with a full scholarship. But, i had lost my winning mentality and couldnt zone in on it. I had basically zoned out of it and possibly permanently. Got above average grades but i know that i performed no way near my first year. Finished college with very respectable grades (mainly because of my lion mentality in my first year). 

And since then, ive only ever felt that druve and mentality once for my uni exams. Can't seem to zone in and zone out when i want.

Its like i have tiny incompetent men inside my head controlling my mentality and they just turn it on when they want and im so fucking frustrated that i cant zone in and out when i want.

Please help. P.S im not a natuve english speaker, so please excuse my grammar mistakes","I think your problem might be with accountability.  


I thought this to myself within the first paragraph of your post.  


The expression you used ""i am in no control over this winning mentality"" says everything.  


That expression takes power away from you. It's easy to say you can't help it, or that you can't control it, but at the end of the day, you can. You just haven't been able to.  


Also, if you don't believe you can keep it consistent, then you won't be able to. Whatever you believe will be what ends up happening.  


So, the first thing you should do about this is to hold yourself accountable. It is your fault you can't stay consistent and you just need to do better in the future.  


Now, after that, once you recognize you have full control over your own actions, then it's time to think WHY it is that you're feeling such a strong resistance. Is your life lacking balance? Are you having enough fun? Or are you just wearing yourself down?  


Could this be a motivational thing? Maybe you're just not as intrinsically motivated to have the best performance possible academically. How much does that matter to you and why does it matter?

&#x200B;

Having your WHY extremely clear will help you a lot.  


Also, you should try to analyze what were the factors that contributed to your epic performance in the past. Try to figure out what were the difference makers and then try to replicate it.  


Hope this can be of some help! Wish you the best","Im on the same boat as you, but from what I have seen in this sub building up a plan and sticking to it is the most important part about consistency. I have committed to some plans before, but never really sticked to them.

I don’t know how it happened but at a certain point in March and April I did the following things:
- I started smoking weed on a weekly basis
- Stopped going to the gym
- Started dating a lot of girls at the same time (who I didn’t even care about in the first place) and had sex with a really bad girl, who I didn’t know anything about and who used cocaine.
- Started compulsively looking for a job, I am a student at university but I always thought that having a job could have helped me when comparing to others / my inferiority complex.
Then, at a certain point, I found myself with an health problem (probably due to stress + sex with that girl) which seems to be nearly solved now, or at least under control. This problem made me not think about all the things above, which I basically stopped.
Next week I will probably go again at my parents home because uni will finish for this period and so I will have 3/4 months in which I don’t have any idea about what to do, which can help me for the future / self-improvement while providing fun.

But every day I just feel so physically and mentally tired.  

I ""work"" 40 hours a week, or at least my company thinks i do, but in reality I probably spend 10-15 hours a week actually working.  The rest I spend sitting around mostly on my phone. At times this punishes me. Especially when I have a workday where realistically I could come in and really work for 4 hours and be out by lunch, but instead I sit around for 6 hours and end up pulling a 10 hour day to compensate as I rush to do everything last minute. 

I struggle to do some of the most basic things. Everybody's main advice always seems to be ""well just do it"" but I can't make myself sometimes. I know that sounds pathetic but when I need to do something like clean a room, work, whatever I panic and escape into my phone or something else.  

I do have a history of depression dating back the past 12 years or so but I honestly think it's gotten better the past few.  I rarely have badly depressed days now, think I'm just kind of numb at this point. 

I'm making this post because it's beginning to effect those around me as well. Recently my SO made a comment at home (and they never ever make comments like this) about how it would be nice if I could do more than just the dishes once a week at home. I'm sitting here now with the mindset of ""yes! Of course! I'll be better about everything immediately!"" but I know as soon as I'm home ill be so worn out for absolutely no reason and I'll just flop onto a chair or the couch and remain there for the most part until bed.  I dont want to be this way but it's like there's this pulling force of laziness and numbness to pressing matters that just pulls me downwards into a spiral of uselessness that's beginning to impact anything and everyone around me.  

I shower once  or twice a week now. I brush my teeth once a day but honestly I missed it the past 24h.  I need help.  

Sorry this post is so jumbled.  I just got down what I could in a moment of clarity. ",Have you been screened for ADHD? This sounds like it might be some of that under the depression.

It's not just dishes and showering- it's everything. I have nothing to look forward too and no sense of purpose to make me feel like actually trying to enjoy my time. Mindfulness seems to be lost on me the more and more I try it. Life is dull and boring and I've felt as if I was in a prison since I was a very young child. I long for this indescrible feeling yet I don't have any motivation to do anything about it. No passions , no dreams and I don't even know where to start to find them. I can't tell if I feel everything or nothing and it's damaged every single relationship in my life.

Many of my creative projects like programming, 3d modeling, game design, etc. I have a huge burst of motivation, energy, where I get a lot done in a short time frame, even being able to sit down and produce meaningful progress on many of them. Then follows maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe months of inactivity on them and I move onto another project, just eventually getting into that cycle all over again.

I've tried to completely draw out my schedule, as in, what needs to get done, at what time, by what day, the description, all that. Yet I always fail to complete them (strangely enough though this doesn't really happen to me with writing). I feel like it's a mixture of burn out, frustration, and maybe incompetence? Once I hit a roadblock that I can't overcome after a decent amount of time, or having to learn a completely new library, plugin, leads to procrastination on my part. Of course, I do know that I am procrastinating during this, but anytime I try to force myself to sit down and think and get back into a similar state of mind when I was actually making progress, my mind starts to wander, and I eventually give up.

It also doesn't help that generally I'm much slower at making progress than I should. For example, it could take me 2 hours to finish a math homework that should only take 45 minutes or less, even if I completely understand the material and get the right answers. It's not like I CAN'T overcome the problem, it's just that I lose all motivation to even attempt the hours long debug or learning of something else after my initial burst. I've done this off-and-on for about since I was 13-14, so 2-3 years.

The greatest mirage society has ever created is that notion that “you need to feel motivated to be able to accomplish something”; this right here messed me up through out secondary school, I repeatedly kept failing classes all because I was too busy worrying that I couldn’t read unless I was motivated. Here’s where discipline comes in; doing it not because you FEEL like but because your growth as an individual DEPENDS on it ( this doesn’t apply only to academics).

     I know all these might sound like a cliché but I’m honestly speaking from experience. I’m currently in my 1st year law major(18m) in my undergraduate University , 1st semester was hell on earth for me. However, what helped me was that I started looking into what my problems actually were, because after I read a book called “atomic habits”, it helped me understand myself better. One good point it made was this “our minds are pre-conditioned to avoid anything that stresses us”, and it deals with these through procrastination that usually comes out as lack of motivation. 

After identifying these problems, I  now had to ask myself “why does studying stress me out”? I did some research and it turned out that I had a terrible reading habit of regression and fixation; They are conscious acts of re-reading sentences and reading one word at a time, which impairs reading comprehension and efficiency. After this discovery, I worked hard to find a solution to them.  Over the months, I have consistently improved on them. Saying that by addressing these problems helped boost my academic performance would be an understatement in all honesty, because I went from procrastinating on a 12page weekly reading  to handling 70+ page weekly readings, and I ended up getting straight A’s in my previous semester, thanks to way I addressed these problems.

 
Lastly doing all these was extremely heart wrenching for me and incredibly frustrating as well. There were  many points in time where I wanted to give up, but I continued, not because I was motivated to but because I had to. 

P.S : Hope this helps, and good luck with your exams!","Take deep breaths.  Stay hydrated. Build momentum.

I found myself not caring for anything and having trouble getting the motivation to study as all the exams were open book and not really stimulating. I finally graduate from college and for the past year I have been preparing to take the mcat. However, for almost a year now I found myself not really studying or even putting in much effort in anything at all. I would study maybe 1-2 hours in the morning every day and get distracted/feel unmotivated (because of the difficulty) to continue until it's 1 pm and it's time to go to work.

Physically - get enough sleep, eat well and get your vitamins (why am I listing this out you’re a med student, you know the drill). Emotionally/mentally, are you running from something? Did the lockdowns shift your perspective? *what changed?* It may not simply come down to a lack of momentum that you’re having a hard time restarting - figure this part out. You’ll want it resolved before residency. 

The path you’re going down requires more than people anticipate - all look at the benefits, glaze over the costs. Make sure you’re prepared to pay the cost, and if so, dig deep to reignite the drive (yeah, it’s gonna hurt and you’re gonna have to go out of your comfort zone so prepare for that). 

Best of luck.",
t3_uv3h7l,[Need advice] Failed out of college a year ago. Can’t figure out a plan and feel like an absolute wastoid.,"I rarely use Reddit so not sure if this is the best place to share my ramblings but hopefully someone can offer some advice it would be much appreciated. This will probably be a long one.

A year ago I was academically dismissed from college. I was in my 4th year and botched 2 semesters in a row. When COVID started everything went online and from that point I gradually started to lose all motivation to even touch my laptop. Got to a point where I just gave up on all of my classes and stopped doing anything for months. 

I just sat in my apartment and watched paint dry until the year was over, my lease was done and the letter came that said I was dismissed. I came back home to live at my Moms house and have been working my part time grocery store job that I’ve been at since high school. 

I’ve never been a great student but I wouldn’t say I was overall horrible either. I was always a B student but sometimes I could pull of an A if I really tried. When online school hit I quickly felt like I wasn’t capable of doing the work anymore. The college workload became annoying to me and I just got sick of doing the assignments. 

I don’t know how to convince myself the work isn’t stupid. It felt like most of the assignments I had to do were pointless, tedious busy work that didn’t really give me any skills or help improve anything for me to benefit. College felt more like it’s just pretentious professors that love hearing themselves talk more than anything else. I lost the will power to get things done even when annoyed by the college routine. So I failed. And the major of all things is media production. 

Not the most difficult thing you would think of. Which adds to the guilt and the feelings I have that make me think I’m a failure and that I’ve wasted a good opportunity. But I wasn’t really THAT interested in the major. It just seemed like the only one I could tolerate. 

I genuinely have no idea what I’m supposed to do with my life and I never have. I just chose media production because I thought, “video editing doesn’t sound too bad.” That’s all the thought that went into that decision. I’m not sure why some people believe that everyone has a passion buried inside of them but I have never been able to figure that out. I’m skating through life and literally feel worthless. 

I have no skills. I have nothing to show for myself. I somehow just lived for 22 years and now I have to figure out what to do with my life. Therapy isn’t bad, but I didn’t feel like it made any of this more clear. They just ask the same questions as everyone else. 

“What do you like to do?” 
Idk man that’s literally why I’m here I have no idea what I like to do I haven’t done shit my whole life. I’m currently miserable the only thing I like is not working all day like a rat. 

I don’t know if I’d even be able to go back to school or if I want to. I feel powerless because nothing entices me enough to bite the bullet and jump through hoops to accomplish something. I don’t know what I’m capable of. I envy people with a plan. I wish I had one. This whole year I’ve been trying to think of SOMETHING to do and I am no closer to figuring it out than I was a year ago. 

I know I sound like a bitter, irresponsible idiot, because I think I am one. I’m ashamed of wasting time doing absolutely nothing, but I’m not going to pick some random shit out of a hat on a whim because I will probably end up wasting even more time being miserable doing that.

“Just try shit” doesn’t resonate with me. It’s such a vague thing to say. Try what? I’m not doing a trade wasting my life fixing furnaces in someone’s filthy ass basement for semi decent money. I have friends that do HVAC and I would rather jump into a volcano.

I know how to use Adobe premier(but I’m in no way great at it) and probably wouldn’t hate video production as a career, I just hate school. The hoop jumping is what gets me. 99% of what I learned about editing came from YouTube. And at least half of the classes that cost thousands of dollars to take have nothing to do with shooting video or editing. This definitely factored into why I stopped trying in school. 

There’s so much more I could say but Reddit mobile gets so laggy after the first few paragraphs so I’ll end it here. Thanks to anyone who took time out of their day to read this it feels good to write this out even though I’m clueless of what to do.

Edit: Also I don’t want this to come off like a sob story or that I’m trying to make people feel bad for me or anything like that. I’m fully aware that I’m still blessed for having a mother who’s willing to put up with my dumbass living in her house while I have an existential crisis. I know there are so many people out there that have it so much worse than I do and that I eventually will straighten this shit out. I really appreciate everyone’s comments it means the world to me.","Have you been tested for ADHD?

Edit: not meaning for that to sound rude. It’s just that your aimlessness sounds a lot like executive dysfunction. 

ADHD brains don’t make dopamine the way typical brains do. Most people can get up and do something just because they’re supposed to, and when they do it, it actually *feels good.* Their brains release that dopamine hit and they feel accomplished. 

ADHD brains.. they don’t do that. So it’s extremely hard for some people to do.. anything. Because there is literally no Feel Good Reward after they do it. So sometimes it’s hard to find anything to be interested in at all. 

Anyway. Just a thought. Might help to rule it out if you haven’t already.",
t3_zm4r0t,[need advice] I feel like I am going back to my old habits,"So I'm(19F)  a young student and I was living alone but due to complicated reasons I had to go back to my parents house. I realised that when i was alone, i was way more disciplined and i used to bring a lot of value to time. I was working out 4x a week, I had a plan and a vision , I had a pretty good meal plan, I was healthy... 

Now that i'm living again with my parents and my 2 brothers i feel like i'm losing myself again. I act like when i had an ED. My screen time is enormous. I'm losing my ideas , my goals... I respect my parents but the energy of this house is so low...(people are shouting, complaining, eating bad)

How can I change my environment ? I sincerely do not want to go back to my old habits. It scares me. 

Thank you.","It's not easy being the only motivated and disciplined person in your environment. You have to be better than who your around. It's takes dedication. Spend more time out of the house around their negative energy. It will consume you and drag yours down with it. 

You don't have to fall back into it just because you're around them. BE exactly who you are even if no one likes it. You don't want to go back then don't. Only you can decide whether you go back. 

Your willpower and values have to be stronger than theirs. Set smalls goals first and work your way up. Easiest way to change your environment is to simply just change it. Get out, be anywhere else but there.  Hope this helps 

Good luck","Probably the best advice here. Find environments outside your home to do your work, maybe a library or some place at school"
t3_x57vy7,[Need advice] How to find motivation for working again? After 3 years,"In my previous job, where i worked 8 years, i saved a ton of cash. I quit around 3 years ago cuz my boss was a massive A hole and the company was quite disorganized. Problem is i haven’t had a job now in 3 years. I’ve been living off savings and am slowly depleting it. But i just can’t find any real internal motivation to work anymore, although i will run out of money eventually. How on earth do i get out of this damn rut?? I have an opportunity recently to get back into the field i was in before but i’m just so blah blah and unmotivated about it all :(",I think you must have some sort of motivation because youve already started the process by coming here and getting some answers.

t3_t2pmhu,[Need advice] My disciplined life becomes chaotic during weekends. How to avoid it?,"I have a 9-5 job and I am disciplined during my weekdays. I always think about completely my pending and important tasks during the weekends. However, when weekends actually arrive, I tend to lose my daily routine. I watch porn a lot till late night on Friday and wakeup late the next Saturday. I also tend to sleep on my bed the weekends without doing my chores. I feel I tend to be more productive during my weekdays even though I have less time compared to my weekends. Hanging out with friends to late night during the weekends is also another reason why my sleep cycle is disturbed.","One thing you might experiment with is taking one day completely off to rest, and the other day schedule something for 9 or 10am outside of the house, like a breakfast with a friend, so you have to get up and get ready for the day. This will also motivate you to not stay up too late the night before.","Why not put 'hang out with friends' and 'watch porn' on your schedule? The time spent doing those things is obviously pleasurable to you, otherwise you wouldn't do them. If those activities in some way contribute to helping you recharge from your week, why not see them as valuable? Then you are removing the feeling that that time is 'wasted'. Your life isn't lacking discipline at the weekend, it's just that you do different things at the weekend and haven't accounted for them in your schedule."

t3_zpx7sl,[Need Advice] How do I get rid of my maths anxiety?,"So I'm in my senior year of highschool and I am one of those people who can score good (around 80-85%) in maths if they put in their efforts. I am able to understand the basic concepts but when i get to practice, i am not able to get myself to start or even do more than 3 ques. I get this anxiety at the thought of solving a maths ques. Please tell me how i can get rid of this anxiety and get myself to practice maths more often. I've not been able to score well in my exams and I have my finals in a month!","Leave behind the idea of you being “good” at math. Probably the anxiety is coming from you being afraid of failing to answer the question, and therefore you lose the motivation. Just understand that you likely dont know shit, and enjoy the process of learning rather than holding on to your past achievements.","The trick is, don’t focus on getting rid of your anxiety

You can’t. Not even if you were a Buddhist monk. You cannot get rid of it.

So where does that leave you? What CAN you do?

The only thing you can really do, is accept that it’s there. It can’t hurt you. It’s just this… feeling. Bring awareness to it, treat it like an old friend that is there to help you do your math study.

If you can, you can even talk to the feeling like it’s a small child. I would say something like, “I know you’re feeling anxious, it’s okay, now let’s have a look at this math problem together, I’m sure if we work as a team, we can figure it out!”

And then approach your maths and see how you go.

Don’t focus on removing the anxiety, acknowledge it, accept it, comfort it and bring it with you and then focus on your study.

Let me know if you have any questions."
t3_t79tsh,[Need Advice] i can't do anything anymore,"To keep it simple, I have been struggling with issues of possible ADHD, complete lack of focus, beyond extreme procrastination (leaving everything to the last 2 hours, be it mid-term exams or even simple things like playing a game), this has been increasing and getting worse since the last 3 years, I feel constantly braindead, whenever I want to do something, I feel tired, or I spend 30 minutes to 5 hours circling around on my phone (even though I uninstalled all social media applications) and going deep in my thoughts instead of actually working.

I feel this almost every time after talking to someone  or talking with a teacher, friend, stranger etc. **I always feel like i said something that is not matching word/not corresponding with the situation like i did something unforgettably bad to them.**.

t3_piy3nt,[Plan][Need Advice] The 500 hour detox,"NOTE: Wrote in a bit of rush. So if my grammar is a little bit off. My bad. I'll edit it when I can.

Also it's gonna be a long one with a story... Here it goes.

My name is u/somedudeafar and I'm an internet addict.

I am 28 years old, single, work a crappy part-time job as a shift manager at a supermarket and I'm wasting my life in front screens. Big ones, small ones and ones big as your head (sorry!). I am a masters degree dropout and what I like to call a stop/starter/giveup'erer(?) and I'm trying my best to get my attention span back to get into a career in IT and to get to my dream role as a systems administrator within the next few years or so.

A few weeks ago it dawned upon me how much I was spending in front of not only a computer screen, but by watching YouTube videos on every device imaginable as well as deadscrolling social media to get that dopamine kick then getting burnt out to the point after all-nighter binge watching/playing of trivial entertainment. I would wake up in the morning feeling groggy, as if I had a hangover, but without the headache, and the rest of my day would be counterproductive. I would only feel motivated and perked up to do something is if I know I have a task or deadline to do through my role as a shift manager and if I go to the gym.

I have a backlog of video games, movies and books to read and it depresses me about how much I've neglected and left unfinished over the past few years or so. Also, I would be cathartic and upset seeing people on social media (almost akin to Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar receiving messages from his loved ones after landing on that planet where one minute is seven hours) who I've known for years move on with their lives... and there's me still living at my parents house, just going upstairs to my room after work, lying on my double bed and watching YouTube on my Smart TV - alone.

Seeing my nephews and nieces grow up after not meeting them for so long also knocked me back a lot. My oldest nephew and niece are 15 and 13 respectively and I've barely seen them in my life because of my lack of motivation even when I had free time (alongside family drama, but still I could of made those journeys to the other side of the city to see them). Seeing my nephew tower above me in height and my niece a spitting image of my sister the other day when I took them to the cinema nearly drove me to the verge of tears almost. I missed so much.

***That was the cherry on top.***

**tl;dr:** Late 20's guy, crappy job and want to go further. Only time I am disciplined is work and gym. Moment of clarity from seeing backlog of media, knowing my ""addiction"" and my older nephew and niece all grown up. Time to make a change.

**The Plan**

I took heed on what would be causing my issues. So I made a list of how many devices I own, what websites I would visit and I set a timer to see how long I would stay on listed websites for. I can't post my times because I feel humiliated to do so. For all intents and purposes let's just say I was on there for a very, very long time (Say, half the day or more)

I also did the peculiar thing of noting down any key events in the last few years or so that would lead me to possibly block Anything out. I previously mentioned family drama but I also suffer from severe Imposter syndrome, had a few bad relationships and friendships here and there as well as deaths in the family and what not. Also, noting ""arduous"" tasks like job searches and emailing people then using YouTube and Facebook as tools to sidetrack myself on purpose.

I took into consideration as to why I was more disciplined with the gym and work my conclusion was there was deadlines for work and a goal for the gym (which is to keep me mentally and physically active). Also, the instant gratification issue of this current internet age played a factor. From the dopamine hits you get from being entertained and then that brain fog and fatigue afterwards.

The past couple of days I planned a 500 hour change (roughly three weeks) and I've done the following:

&#x200B;

* **I deactivated facebook, Twitter and other key websites I know I'll be hooked on for 3 weeks (roughly 500 hours).**
* **Utilising the phone as a tool as NOT as an entertainment device to alleviate boredom.**
* **I've also deleted Spotify off my desktop and laptop.**
* **Blocked YouTube off my desktop and deleted it off my phone.**
* **Delegating some apps to certain devices as well as blocking websites using Stayfocusd on Chrome.** (i.e. Spotify to my phone for podcasts and music in the car and gym)
* **Also disconnected the internet off my Smart TV, only using my PS4 for Netflix and because the YouTube app doesn't work on there for some reason and no, I don't want to fix it.**
* **My phone, tablet and laptop are either in another room or locked away/on charge on the other side of the room so that they are out of reach away.**
* **Setting myself at least 2-3 hours a day to help educate myself to reach my goal of getting my foot in the door towards my career goal.**
* **Setting myself up a physical and digital workspace (folders for entertainment and work) and getting rid of distractions. Working in another room if need be to keep me away from them.**
* **Keeping to a solid sleep pattern given my current shifts (trying to get 7 to 8 hours a night)**

If anyone can offer me any more I could do? Or if this is good enough or needs some changes? Let me know.

**My GOAL**

**My goal is to hopefully get myself into a jumpstart mode; getting me out of this rut I've got myself into and to stop using the internet as a means of abiding and wasting my days away. I go to the gym, I have a job that I want to get out of and I have a goal in mind. My issue is my discipline. My aim now is to get disciplined and be able to study and pass one of my IT certifications to get my foot in the door and keep on going.**

t3_y1djy0,[Need Advice] I Want to Stop Being an Idea Guy,"I’m stuck feeling like I’m full of ideas for my own or other people’s games and stories but I don’t have the skills to make them. Programming makes my head spin I tried for months to learn blender but got too distracted and gave up without making masterpiece animations, and got stuck never completing a donut tutorial so I’m stuck in an phase of being jaded and feeling cheated like I have all these ideas and share them freely but there’s no appreciation or prospective future in doing so.

I suppose the easy answer is learn. A post in a game dev Reddit told me to come here but I haven’t seen massive improvements to convince me I’m succeeding at discipline or getting to a point where I can say I made the thing!

I suppose I’m warped and I’m sorry if I am flooding this Reddit with lots of possibly repeat posts. But I don’t feel like things are clicking in a way to make me launch into the path of hard work yet so I’m still here trying to find that spark that propels me correctly.

&#x200B;

Typically, idea guys don't make it far without a skill to back them up.  The skill doesn't necessarily have to be a hard skill such as: programming or art.  It can also be softer skills such as project management, or communication.

Either way, developing a skill, is a sure way to help get your ideas moving forward. For example, if you choose to be a very convincing manager/leader, who can listen to others and take their opinions into consideration, that can be a very valuable skill.  

You could become great at organization and management. You could get really good at raising funding and managing the assets to get people paid.

&#x200B;

So being an idea guy is good, but it can't be the only thing you have.  The reality is, you'll need another skill to back up and provide value."
t3_13u5u19,[Need Advice] How do you start to regulate yourself when you realise you are just a mess/never have.,"TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?

(30-Age)
Alright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don’t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very naïve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. 
Anyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.","I’ve been there, mate (I’m 37M). Until recently I was feeling the same way you do, but I am really turning things around. I’ve been doing what I can to turn myself around. I’ve been going to therapy, I’ve been working on myself by looking long and hard at my life, I’ve been working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof method, etc. What really started to make a big difference was my diet - I went zero carb and my mental health improved dramatically. The effect would not have been so big without the other stuff, I think. 
In short - have faith, work on yourself, try every day, strive to be and one day you will wake up who you want to be.","1.Write down honestly what you are addicted to

2.Challenge yourself to be a certain amount of weeks without these addiction. Every time you succeed for a few days you have changed a little.

Believe me. You will come to this sensation of confusion over and over again. The only way to move forward is to spend in excessive amount of time with yourself. Your own mind, your creativity and your voice. Until you find what you really want to with your life."

t3_z8fe9j,[Need Advice] How do you declutter your mind from overthinking and constant doubts?,"
Why does overthinking make you stop from achieving any goals or even stop you from attempting to start working on your goals or any tasks that you feel like completing and conquering.

It’s like our anxiety or whatever we feel sacred about makes us not want to do anything. It’s like a comfort state of mind but it’s actually messing up my life because I feel like I’m getting behind in my life when I’m not doing the things that I’m suppose to be doing, instead I’m living in some comfort zone. I just don’t know how to break that barrier and come to a realization. I mean I’m doing alot of self reflecting but I’m not taking actions to create a change. It’s like I’m trapped in a trap I created by overthinking and I just want to get out of it","Your habitual response to discomfort (anxiety, fear, doubt, etc. ) is AVOIDANCE, and the first step towards changing things would be to shift it towards ACCEPTANCE.

t3_t0bf66,[need advice] I need to make her proud.,"so, my momma passed last week and my step dad said her last wishes were to make sure I was ok and to be able to take care of myself and I need to do this.

my sister cares and she's hard on me but ik it's bc she cares. but I don't think it's fair for her to expect me to have a plan just yet.

however, I always have ideas floating around in my head.

here are some facts:

- I have about 2 years worth of college credits under my belt towards a degree in social work. I don't think I want to go to school rn. hell, I don't know if I want to go back to school at all. maybe sometime in the future. I don't know if I want to be a social worker anymore either.

- according to my sister I can ""barely take care of myself"". I mean yes I live with mental illness but it doesn't mean I'm inept or incompetent. I just am not good at the important stuff like scheduling appts, taking meds on time, folding clothes, some hygiene stuff, etc. I mean I'm functional, but not to her standards.

- after the insurance payout, I'll be able to get a car so I'll have transportation in general.

- I'm getting a cat to maintain some level responsibility/routine as well as have a companion now that I'll most likely be alone in the house. 

- I'm pursuing a Google certificate to kind of dip my toe into the tech world. other than social work it's the only thing that seems interesting imo.

- I don't have a job. however, I have time.

My plans so far:
- stay in therapy
- keep cat alive
- learn to drive for real. I have a license but don't drive.
- get a job/save
- get certificate
- get a better job
- cut back on smoking (vaping) weed

idk what I'm doing. I feel like I've fried my brain. I've been high for the past year and I'm not bragging about that. it sucks. I have a rough idea of what I want to do but how do I find the motivation to do any of these things? I'm not sure that my ""plan"" is even a good one.

t3_wcjbh9,[Need Advice]I think I just realized that I'd rather just hoard a bunch of information rather than acting on any of it,"For years I've had this thing where I would always write down anything I'd like to do at a later date. Except I would almost never start those things but the lists would just keep growing. 

Lately I've been doing self discovery and self help and all that and I realized that for some reason I can only explore and save my options, but never actually action any of them...

Instead of picking one or two personal flaws and working on them I spent months just digging and prodding trying to figure out everything wrong with me.

Instead of picking one potential job or college degree or hobby, I gotta research every possible thing that interests me and then just sit on them doing nothing.

This shit even happens with movies. I paid for Netflix, Hulu, and Prime video at the same time, spent hours wish listing all the things I wanted to watch and then just sat on it because I didn't know where to start.

but yeah, im so focused on hoarding all these things that I wanna start or change but I never actually do anything about it. How can I fix this.","You need some little wins to start building confidence;

My psychologist said confidence isn’t natural, it’s a biproduct of doing. 

But you don’t need to do something big and dramatic or life changing, you just need to focus on what you want from the moment. 

My advice, find something that truly keeps you mindful and in the moment, and practice appreciating it and thank yourself and your body for being ok to be In the moment. 

For me, I pull weeds in my yard. It’s maybe 5-10 minutes of just air, weeds and my yard. Maybe my cat sometimes, but nothing steals this time from me. 

Since I’ve started this, I swear I can see clearly again lol I finally started the YouTube channel I launched almost a full year before, started back at the gym with all new approaches I had learned but never executed on, I’m utilizing a lot of my workplace tools I used to teach in my own freelancing and life now to help me manage everything. 

If you’re anything like me, you’ve learned everything you can and are probably proud of it all, but it adds to the noise. You gotta give yourself space to organize your thoughts and be able to utilize them","Fellow knowledge hoarder who struggles with inaction here. I finally pinpointed some of my problem: the idea that making a choice out of the multitudes I have “closes the door” on the rest of the options. Which can be true in certain cases but usually isn’t. 

To use a small example, tv shows. When you have an hour free to watch something, you see all the potential opening in front of you. Choosing one option removes all the potential except for one. And somehow my brain views that lost potential as something that could be a threat to our happiness. But it’s really not. I can definitely watch all the shows I want to watch, I just need to pick one quickly and go with it.

Basically, you just gotta start things sometimes. Sometimes it’s the wrong choice, and your time could have been spent better with a different choice. But doing something is always better than letting the inertia of inaction and the fear of making bad choices keep you from doing anything."
t3_13iiiex,[Need Advice] Went from extreme discipline to basically zero. Very unhappy with myself and my life.,I'm learning to play the guitar.,"Sounds like you’re experiencing burn out. You worked really hard, you still work really hard, so first thing first, give yourself some credit. 

I recommend sleeping a little bit more, force yourself to go to bed before 11 PM, you are not resting enough. Working for 12 hours is definitely too much; work is draining your energy. If you’re independent and have the opportunity to decide your time, i suggest you to stop working at most within 8 PM. 

If the place you live in is not enjoyable for you and you live alone, consider to move in a less expensive environment.
By now, your mental and physical health needs to be your number one priority. Find a hole in your routine to take a moment for sport, jogging, yoga, quick workout at the gym (45 min is enough), boxe (even at your home if you want to!), there are many choices. 

If you don’t have much time to cook, which is a super relaxing and fun hobby, you can try meal prep, so you can make healthier choices and don’t have to think about cooking everyday; you can prep during the weekend.

20M college student. Pursuing Btech IT, currently in my 5th sem...

&#x200B;

I wanted to increase my GPA so I decided to study hard, I made a plan, a schedule, and other stuff but I am just not able to do it. I am never able to follow my schedule.

&#x200B;

Certainly, I know I have to start small and Yes, I did start small but I still wasn't able to follow my plan and make a habit.

&#x200B;

What's the problem I am facing?

There is no one fixed problem, it's more like a mixture of problems. I'll try to explain.

Okay Again, What's the problem I am facing?

**(1/4)** I am just not confident in my abilities and it's sort of becomes the reason ""why to even study for a day when I am gonna ignore my studies for a week after that"".  I am not confident in myself, whenever I try to make a habit, I will do something for 1-2days and (relapse) wouldn't touch it for 1-2 weeks or keep putting them off tomorrow (procrastinate).

&#x200B;

**(2/4)** I simply don't think I'd be able to do it, I am talking about remembering 800 pages of theory. I don't think I can do that. 2 reasons:

1st) I simply don't see myself there, a person who would be able to remember 800 pages in 3 months, even by breaking the problem i.e. doing 2,3, or 5 pages per day I am not able to do it. I understand the concepts and stuff but I know myself and I know it is impossible for me to remember 800 pages.

2nd) Refer to point 4/4 kindly

&#x200B;

**(3/4)** Everyone around me thinks I am smart af...even when I am in the bottom 20 of my class in academics, I don't know why. It's maybe because I subconsciously project myself as a smart guy. It's just not me, I feel am deceiving people because I don't want them to find out that I am fucking dumb. I swear I feel like my IQ is going down rapidly, In school, I was a fast thinker but now I am just sluggish when it comes to quick decision making, It's like my thinking part of the brain is fogged.

&#x200B;

**(4/4)** Whenever I open the book and I see black and white pages with theory, IDK what the fuck happens but I feel like my whole energy has been drained.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

oh man, help will be deeply appreciated, I am in a new low...Thanks.","Have you tried the coursera learning how to learn course?

Spaced repetition software like Anki could also be a game changer if you stick with it","First of all download Study Bunny app. It's basically like a pomodoro app which notes down the exact number of hours you study everyday. That way you can see how many hours you studied each month & the time of the day when are the most productive. 

You said that you can't study everyday because you don't think you can maintain that habit for a long time. In that case, you need to tell yourself that you neither have to study everyday, nor you have to study the same number of hours everyday. You don't have to maintain a streak of the most number of days you studied at a stretch. 

What you need to do instead is to fix the number of chapters you are gonna read in one week and the number of hours you'll give in total for that entire week. 

That way your goal won't be to study, say, 4 hours a day for 7 days a week to complete 5 chapters in a week. Your goal will actually be something like studying 3 chapters for a total of 15 hours in one week. So someday you'll study for 4 hour, some day you'll study for 2, some day you'll study nothing at all but at the end of the week you would have studied for 15 hours in total. And you would have completed your goal of 3 chapters.

Sure this method might mean you maybe studying less than what you thought you could have. But atleast it won't give you anxiety and you'll atleast get something done rather than nothing done at all because you were feeling under confident. 

Focus on the sum total. Don't focus on the streak you maintained.

You said you just don't think you can study a book of 800 pages, no matter how small you break down your goals.
Here's where you have to lie to yourself. Tell yourself that you can. Wake up everyday and tell yourself that you are capable of completing a 800 page book if you broke it down into reasonable number of pages everyday. Tell yourself that you see no reason why that's impossible. You can do it and you will. You gotta ""Fake it till you make it"". Up until now your brain has been constantly telling you that you can't do it. And it didn't even bother to give you reason why. But you'll give it a reason OP. You will tell yourself that you believe in yourself and hence you'll complete that book of 800 pages. 


People think that you are smart but you think you aren't. You think maybe it's because you are subconsciously projecting that you are smart. Alright then, maybe ever since you left school for college, you really are not that smart anymore. You said so yourself, didn't you? 

But since these college mates still think that you are smart even though you think you aren't, even though you are just pretending to be smart then I guess maybe you are less smart than what they think you are but you are definitely more smart than you think you are. 

OP you just need to trick your mind into being your bitch. Stop letting it control you. You start controlling it. Tell it whatever it needs to hear to get it working for you. Trick it, lie to it, comfort it with truth, comfort it with lies & fake confidence. Do whatever you can but remember that you will talk to your mind and you won't let it talk back to you. Because the only thing your mind is telling you these days is that you aren't smart or capable enough to accomplish anything. But in the end it's only you who knows the truth."

Suggest me some sleep habits or techniques that helped you.","I've finally managed to break my bad sleep habits. Here's how:

1. Start preparing for bed in advance of your bedtime. For example, if you want to go to bed at 10:30, set an alarm 1 hour to start doing bedtime routines. So at 9:30 you shower, brush teeth, start dimming/turning off lights, get stuff ready for tomorrow, etc.
2. Immediately stop using cellphone or computers at this alarm time as well. This period is your bedtime preparation phase and planning for tomorrow phase, nothing else.
3. Use settings in your smartphone which make the phone almost unusable at this cutoff time. Android has sleep routines. In this routine you can set it to automatically make the screen black and white and limit app usage. Use this. It's powerful. Then charge your phone at night far away from you in an ugly place. I put my phone on the floor at the other end of the room. Never on the nightstand.
4. Throughout the day, think ahead about your bedtime routine. Nothing happens spontaneously, including sleep. By thinking throughout the day, you mentally **prepare that your day will definitely end at this 9:30 cutoff and you must complete your tasks before then.**
5. Start at an easier bedtime and start pushing it back more and more as the habit gets stronger. Now I could make myself wake up at 5 AM easily daily if I wanted to just by changing when I start my bedtime prep routine.
6. Once you get the basics you can start to make the sleep routine enjoyable. Throw in things that are calming but not cellphone or computer related. Drink tea, write goals, write in a journal, etc within that hour.

If you find your mind racing while in bed, get out a pen and paper and write about the thoughts for a few minutes. Studies show writing on the issue to be calming and will silence the mental chatter.","1. Stop using gadgets in bed
2. Avoid blue light  for 1 hour after waking up and 1 hour before going to bed

Ask your parents for help if youre still young + have a good relationship to them. Some disorders make it considerably harder to lead a healthy, disciplined life and treatment (therapy) can make this journey so much easier.

When feeling uneasy and especially when getting palpitations regulate your breathing. Sit down if possible, breathe in, breathe out. Remember that the feelings will pass, as all feelings do. Palpitations can be scary, but they pass the fastest if you stay calm. A detail a doctor/ therapist might be interested in is whether the palpitations occur when you're active or when you're still (running/lying down etc.)"

t3_ojhfp6,[Need Advice] Feeling sleepy all the time,"I'm practicing dopamine detox these days because its not like I just want to try, I simply need it. I'm a very distracted person which simply hampers my studies. I've started with common things like no social media, no random searching on the internet, no youtube, not using phone (just using twice, once in the morning and once at night just to check mails, read some good posts on reddit etc.), no music (I don't watch movies and shows that much so thats already in control). 

Problem is while I study or work on something else as well, I feel sleepy, a lot. This problem is concerning because I have a healthy diet, and sleep for atleast 6-7 hours at night (usually I go to bed around 12), yet....

Previously in my old routine, I used to just put on the headphones and listen to music while working. That used to keep my mind active. But now when I fully want to concentrate, without music or anything, I just can't. No doubt, I've improved a lot due to my new routine and practice but feeling sleepy is the issue. 

Any advice on how to get over this? I want to control it rather than letting it control me and sabotaging my studies or work.","You're going to get some great advice on this, but I'll offer up something that will sound bizarre, but hear me out: brush and floss your teeth. 

I was dealing with the same issue last year despite being a healthy person. Admittedly, I've never been great at brushing twice a day or flossing (I brushed once, in the morning, and NEVER flossed). However, after switching to a new dentist, it was discovered that I had a mild case of gingivitis (the dental professionals will need to correct my terminology).

Long story short, it was explained to me that my body uses energy to fight off the infection of gingivitis, constantly; and that chronic fatigue is a consequence. Here's an article that explains it better: [https://nancyshibadds.com/p/BLOG-36442-2017.4.20-Is-Gum-Disease-Draining-Your-Energy-p.asp#:\~:text=The%20gums%20are%20rich%20in,feel%20worn%20out%20and%20tired](https://nancyshibadds.com/p/BLOG-36442-2017.4.20-Is-Gum-Disease-Draining-Your-Energy-p.asp#:~:text=The%20gums%20are%20rich%20in,feel%20worn%20out%20and%20tired).

I now brush twice and floss daily without fail, and that's because of the energy spike I felt within two weeks of not being a gross dude.","I don't understand the reasoning behind getting rid of the music, especially if it apparently worked well for you.

t3_q0nupo,[Need advice] I'm only living life for the next weekend,"I work a corporate 9 - 5 job, but because of covid and WFH, it's been more of a 9 - 9 kinda deal. I'll not get too much into it but I'm miserable during the weekdays. I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - 

Monday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. 

I want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. 

My current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.

How do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","I personally don't think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.

I can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!)."

t3_yexynj,[Need advice] I've been escaping reality for the last 7 months,"Not completely. There have been days and nights when I've had to face my reality. But it's so jarringly terrible that I always reverted to escapism.
Escapism is reading romance novels, watching Netflix, scrolling Twitter and Reddit, trying to find new friends, trying to hold on boys who don't show enough interest back, sleeping excessively, eating excessively, going out.
Reality is a big fucking exam I have to give, the weight I have to lose, a toxic family, an inability to make a schedule and stick to it (either due to personal reasons or because college is extremely chaotic and something or the other keeps getting in the way), feeling lonely and having no special person in my life, feeling disappointed by my friends and reliving past traumas.
I know a lot of this can be considered as excuses but for someone living this life, they're genuine reasons. I am trying. I really am.

Have a goal. Make a plan. Break it into small steps. Take action on small steps to reach your goal. Be disciplined a d consistent. 

Delete Netflux and Twitter and Reddit if need be. Orvlimit it to max 30 minutes a day. 

A marathon is run by taking small steps. And starts with making a decision and putting on your running shoes.

You can do it.","sounds like you're exhausting yourself doing a lot of things you don't enjoy; that's why you're struggling so hard and trying to escape reality. you're tired and depressed because you're in constant battle with yourself... there's a part of you screaming and clawing to be uncaged, stop fighting with it; it's yourself, you crave a relationship because you don't feel whole due to rejecting and casting away parts of yourself.

real talk, ask Jesus to help you out in understanding yourself and in being your true authentic self.

once you learn to be entirely honest with yourself, accept yourself, and trust your own will; you'll start to find inner peace. with a sated spirit and at ease mind, you will then have the energy and focus to do the things you know you actually want to do and it'll never feel like work."

I am an 18 year old man

There is a lot im doing wrong and i am scared, the emotions i feel are wrong, all my behavior or lack thereof is causing me fear

1. I am filled with false fear, fear that does nothing but prevents me from taking the steps to improve myself, i am always afraid when i try to think of improvement and i do not move as a consequence

2. I have no real personhood or core self, i do not hold any values, morals or virtues, my personality shifts to situation and person and it sickens me because i want to be a person but i am no one when i am not being stimulated and i have no real person to call myself as that person

3. I lack thought, i feel like i dont think deeply enough and when i actually try it doesnt go anywhere, i am willing to try to learn more and get better at critical thinking but i am in a pathetic no thought state

4. I feel out of control of my body and mind, when the desire comes to do sinful acts or be angry or overall act on instinct/impulse, i always fail at control or restraint, even before the initial urges my mind stops and i cant control myself or maybe thats what i like to say to ease myself of responsibility

5. My laziness is a constant in my life, i dont know if it is from the fear but i am in an inactive state, i do not have any discipline or internal anger to drive myself and i fail at trying to create that within me or i just dont try hard enough 

6. My psychology seems pretty simple, i look for a way out of most things or thought patterns because it scares or makes me uncomfortable, so i seek a way to stop feeling those things through false coping 

7. I live in patterns, i live day in and day out in patterns in my mind and my actions, it never ceases, i always can recognize the patterns which are harmful, but i am too paralyzed to stop them


I am only getting older, i know some responses are going to be about going to the gym but how do i even tell my ego and fear to shut up so i can get there

I go to college soon, i dont know how to become more stable, maybe that is a lie too


Any advice please, i do want change but my subconscious knows how to avoid the change and be the same forever 

I dont want to be 35 years old and still be 18 mentally","One thing I will say is a lot of things that you seem to be beating yourself for, are the same types of problems that you’ll find in a lot of people. I know it feels like you’re alone in your struggles but you are not.

Also, while reading this, it’s seems like you are demanding a lot of yourself and punishing yourself when you don’t meet those standards. First thing, I’d say is to focus more on being more gentle with yourself. It’s ok to have desires but try to stray away from the “do or die” mindset and just focus on thinking of it more optimistically. Don’t think “I have to do this or x will happen” but more “If I do this, x will happen”. 

Train yourself to do that everyday and you’ll see change eventually. You’ll be looking at your life with a healthier perspective and your desires will naturally be answered because of that. Patience and perseverance is key though. Take it day by day, and don’t tell yourself that you are running out of time, as long as you are working towards what you want to accomplish in the present moment, you have time.","I’ve been there. Turns out I had a lot of trauma that turned into anxiety that turned into numbness and/or inappropriate emotional reactions. I didn’t understand me cuz I couldn’t feel me. And I couldn’t feel me because it was unbearable. 

Maybe it’s today. Maybe it’s five years from now. (A therapist or close friend can definitely help expedite the process.) One day you feel your feels. Pat yourself on the back if you do. This is called emotional processing and it’s necessary to heal but it doesn’t need to be rushed.

You’ll be okay."

Also, motivational podcasts and online content is probably making you feel inadequate and lazy.

t3_104a78m,[Need Advice]Why does it so hard to take the first step to bettering yourself whether it’s facing your fears or overcoming an obstacles or working towards a goal..,"
2023 already begun but my mentality of living life has been the same since 2015 and I’m so sick and emotionally tired of it. Taking the first step to self improvement has been a struggle for me. I really feel so anxious and scared to working towards my goals and things I need to work on. Spring semester starts next week and I still haven’t signed up for classes and back of my mind that’s all I worry about. I worry and stress myself so much but I’m not facing my fears. I don’t know what it could be whether it’s anxiety or am I living my life in boundaries and fears. 

It’s so easy for so many people to just do it and not care about the outcome or failure. All they do is just keep pushing forward meanwhile I’m viewing life like birds eye view, wanting to predict the outcome and this thoughts of what if I fail or what I mess up. This constant anxiety and overthinking is holding me back from achieving my goals and living life to the fullest. It’s like I’ve made restrictions and created boundaries in my head. Sometimes I feel like my mind has become a prison","Lots of people are in that situation.

Divide what you need to do into steps. Know what the first, very small step is. Focus on just that. Take one step, then relax and reward yourself.

As you start actually doing things, usually the anxiety associated with a given step diminishes. You get used to it.

Make that first step very, very small. Do something every day.","Instead of setting up a big task that you can fail or succeed, set smaller, achievable tasks that you're unlikely to fail.

Instead of  saying 'I'll get perfect marks this semester', say 'on week 1 of school I will study for 20 minutes each day and make sure I finish my assignments for that day'. Even if you skip one day of study, 20 minutes won't make much of a difference on your final grade. But if you do study each day for those 20 minutes, you can be sure you completed that day's task.

I'll set myself as an example. One of my life goals is to run a marathon. The thing is that I've never really done any serious exercise in my life.

So instead of saying 'I have to run a marathon or else', I said 'I will run for 3 minutes each day for one week', then increased it to 5 minutes and so on and so forth. Eventually, my body adapt and my technique will be enough to do a marathon.

It's the same with your grades, if you work small tasks diligently, academic success should be within reach."

I've got a great support system at home and everything else in my life is going great as well. But this is the reason I wake up in the morning feeling as though someone is stabbing me in the heart and feel pukish whenever I think about it.

Does anyone feel like they’re over analyzing life and any decisions or tasks to work on. Like why do we over complicate things and any task we try to do, how come overthinking and fear prevent us from doing it. Why do we take people words personally and let it affect us.

My current methods centre around a huge clean/ tidy occasionally or a panic clean before guests arrive. I’d love to just maintain a level but can’t seem to ever manage it.,"No advice but just some food for thought - the 40+ hr work week was established when the assumption was that you would have a stay-at-home wife to do all of your cooking/cleaning/housework.

I am right there with you struggling to keep my apartment clean.

Good luck fitting more cleaning into your days and be kind to yourself!","Admittedly, by apartment is very small, but this is what I do:

Everyday, I just clean for 20 minutes. Sometimes, I make it 30, but 20 minutes is all I usually need, but I never do less than that. There is an amazing amount of housework that can get done in just 20 minutes. You won't finish on day 1, but keep going and every day your house will be a little bit more clean and tidy, until one day, you've run out of things to do during those 20 minutes.

The thing here though, is that on any given day, I don't make more mess than would take me more than 15 min to clean up (except on maybe days where I cook and bake *a lot* as dishes will take longer on those days). So 15 min is my base needs + 5 extra minutes to make sure I eventually can start cleaning my desk drawers. Be honest: how much mess do you make every day?"

t3_ph4bt8,[Need Advice] how to wake up early and not feel tired all day long?,"i'm currently 18 and just finished high school for the majority of which i woke up at 10 or 11am. i tried waking up early a few months ago and got down to 6am and noticed that my days felt a lot longer and productive but i've been a little stressed lately. i need to get an overwhelming amount of work done in very little time and just the thought of it tires me out. i'm currently at an all time low where i sleep at 6am and wake up at 4pm and get nothing done, feel terrible about myself and fall back into the cycle again. some of the things i've tried which didn't work out-

\-the biphasic sleep cycle 

\-staying up all night and day so i could go to sleep early the next night (multiple times)

\-all kinds of alarm things (putting it far away from bed, getting a puzzle alarm app etc.)

\-going on a run with someone early morning to wake up out of obligation (the only thing that was starting to work out but my friend bailed on me lol)

i feel like it's because i feel demotivated all the time nowadays. i tell my mom to wake me up but she doesn't really bother. if i do manage to get up early somedays, i feel tired no matter what i do and end up taking naps that last for hours (leading to not feeling sleepy at night and falling back into the cycle). i've tried coffee but it really doesn't work on me. i don't think i'm a night owl because i can get nothing done at night. i desperately want to establish a healthy sleep pattern and stick to it because the few times i've done it helped me become wayyy more productive and happy. every piece of advice would be helpful, thank you so much!",Buy sleeping mask. It helped me to sleep at 7pm and wake up at 3am in the college back then.,"I'm older than you now, but I struggled with this same exact issue. It's working for me now, but it took a lot of practicing to get here! Listen to your body to try not to get too discouraged.

Some less-vague ideas:
Sometimes I get up and do something else for a bit, then lay back down, and sleep comes easier. (Usually just something relaxing, like reading.) Other times I'll stay in bed, but try to occupy myself with something else. I'll try to say the alphabet backwards, or just tell myself I'm only going to relax tonight and not sleep. (It helps to take the pressure off!)

When I was really struggling, watching Futurama was the only thing that would slow my mind down enough to let me fall asleep. Not that I'd recommend using screens, but sometimes I just felt I needed a crutch. I kept reading & tried to learn more about how sleep works, and eventually I was falling asleep earlier & easier. I also experimented with other aspects, like diet, meditation, exercise, etc.

When I have nights now that I struggle through, I have a lot of practice with concepts that work for me. And I know why they work for me, which helps getting back to sleep much less stressful!

I think you're on the right track! I know how much it sucks to go through this, but I really do think any work you put in will pay off for you in unexpected ways."
t3_qor2kr,[Need Advice] Turned 30 recently trying to get my life back on track,"Hey all,

I turned 30 years old this year and ended up back living with my parents after going through a pit of depression about 6 years ago. In that time, I've graduated from a school in music production and am one course away from a diploma in HR which i'm still somewhat not convinced is entirely a real job lol... How do I somehow get my life together? I've been out of work for 6 months since finishing my last year of school and am super confused. I've worked a lot of entry level positions since I was 16 in retail, sales, customer service, warehouse as well as a bit of labour but never really stuck with anything for longer than 3 months to a year. I feel like I'm super arrogant as well for no reason and I just don't know how to move forward. I spent a substantial amount of time drinking and partying in university with little to no effort on school and ended up flunking out 10 years ago which was a  definitely a bit of a blow to my confidence as well as my drive/ambitions. I spent alot of my early 20's trying to pursue music and at some point that just seemed like a super unrealistic goal so I said ""screw it"" and gave it up... That's about the same time I started to get somewhat depressed. I like to think I'm not an unintelligent person and can sometimes be very resourceful but the second half of my twenties was just a big shit show and I feel like I'm trying to pick up the pieces.

To add to all that I have zero close relationships other than my parents (who are a bit fed up at this point) and zero friends at the moment after being one of the more sociable guys growing up (Maybe a bit narcissistic in hindsight) . I've let a lot of things die out in my life because I've struggled with hard work, dedication as well as forming deep relationships/moving forward. At this point, I'm thinking of going back to school for health sciences because it's really the only thing that I've been interested in the past 5 years and I've been active/lifted weights since I was about 13 years old. On the other hand I thought about going for computer science/programming because I've also played games for most of my life. Figured I could maybe make a career out of it one of those. I've also thought about going a more local community college which is in my hometown and working towards a trade certificate which would be a bit more stable even though I've never really been or worked in any trades environments. I dunno. At this point the only two people around me are my parents who give me feedback but their bottom line is to just get me out of the house asap. If you made it to the end of this you're the real MVP :). Any help would be appreciated.

TLDR: Turned 30 recently- diplomas in useless program thinking about going back to school or not really too sure how to fix my life, job and relationships.","I'm 31, and I'll tell ya, a lot of us don't have our shit together as well haha. I live part time with my parents (though, by choice), and otherwise I live abroad in different countries bc it's too expensive to live in my hometown (Bay Area).   


So #1 - give yourself some compassion and just know that we're all figuring life out one day at a time   


\#2 - Finish your HR degree, for sure. Don't give up on that. Get a job in HR for a little while and build some funds  


\#3 - During that time, work on yourself. Grace, etiquette, humility. If you have a day job, you can practice music at night or other hobbies.   


\#4 - volunteer. This one is always overlooked imho. Most people need a sense of purpose in their lives and it combats depression. Volunteering at a charity/organization for helping others will do wonders for your soul. Don't be afraid to try out several organizations. Just 2 hours per week is a good way to get your serotonin flowing  


\#5 - Give yourself a timeline of like 3 years. Don't make it 6 months, you'll set yourself up for failure. But don't give yourself 10 years either, because that'll delay some motivation. Figure out what your goals are, 3 - 5 - 10 years down the line and put your head down and get to work. There are a lot of youtube videos out there for self-improvement, so you could probably  learn about that in a weekend if you wanted to. Same with budgeting, deeper relationships, etc. Learn about them first, then put them to practice. Check in with yourself at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, etc. Once you hit a goal or are comfortable with your progress with something, add in another thing to the mix.   


Good luck!","Firstly Kudos for trying to pick up the pieces. It's not easy to do and it's great to see that you are actively trying to improve your situation.

I don't have specific advice in terms of the career you can pursue, but I have had a similar life trajectory. I messed up my 20s and ended up living with parents. Over the last year I've systematically worked to get back on my feet. My advice would be to list down all the things you need to fix, and tackle them one at a time. 

If you think you're arrogant, started fixing that part of yourself. Then systematically work towards getting a job. Once you have those things sorted, you can start meeting new people and developing friendships/relationships and so on.
Believe me it starts getting progressively easier. Just be self aware and start by fixing things one at a time."
t3_p5ulx3,[Need Advice] Thinking about taking a gap year,"I dont think im ready for college.

I think the gap year would let me develop more as a human but im also scared im gonna stay in this state and just keep putting it off. I have passions and hobbies that i want to explore in college but something just doesn’t feel right.","I say do it. I took a gap year the summer of 2020 and it was the best thing I could have done for myself last year. I was still in school but the pandemic made me realize that I was not happy with the degree I was pursing. So I left the program and just stopped. I worked the entire time and was figuring myself out. I ended up transferring to a university that I decided about a year later.
Having some sort of plan is the key though so you don’t get too distracted. And give urself a timeline of how long you may need the rest. And there is not wrong with extending that timeline too. A year or even 2, your body and mind are the most important things.
Also remember, THERE IS NO RUSH!! You cannot compare yourself to others because you are on a different path that they are. And there is nothing wrong with that. Your journey is gonna look different from everyone else. I also recommend TheBlissBean, Lavendaire, MucheleB, and RowenaTsai. They are all on YouTube and they make content regarding to school, lifestyle, finding yourself and being more mindful in general. There is also Matt D’Avella, Ali Abdaal, Nathaniel drew, Captain Sinbad, and Thomas Frank. They are on YouTube too and offer a male perspective on mindful lifestyle, productivity, and finding your interests","I wish I had done a gap year. I was in college less than a week after high school graduation. 

Make sure you get a budget together so you can still have some money for college, or a nest fund for when you decide to get a new place, set aside. And remember that you can always decide to do something else later. I'm 31 and working on my fourth degree, which is like my 7th serious career change. 

I've also gotten depression lately and I can tell you trying to do coursework at the same time is HARD. I have been doing minimal semesters and barely passing. 

I do suggest you get a license and a working phone sooner than later though. Those are hugely helpful when you're on your own. 

Set a hard deadline for the end of the year and be sure to mark when college applications and FAFSA submissions are due and when the semester officially starts. Oh, and some colleges DO allow you to apply a full year ahead. You can always choose not to go. And you don't have to pay tuition until the drop date (when the school automatically drops people from the classes for non payment)"
t3_wk4jnv,[Need Advice] I've become lazy/chill from not having a ton to do at work. How to get back into it?,"I work in finance and more specifically, I bounce around to accounts we have, help out, fill in for people on maternity/paternity leave, and do random projects. It's a rather high end job, six figures, fully remote. I've been with the company about 5 years now.

I've done new business transitions and been on some very hard, time consuming accounts. I've also worked for other companies where I put in 60+ hour work weeks regularly, had to go into the office always, etc. So I know what hard work really is.

Over the past year, I really haven't had a ton to do. My past two assignments have been very easy. Currently, my work is so automated that I work maybe a few hours a month... literally. I push a few buttons, let some VBA macros run, output files, and verify them. That's about it. These tasks typically took \~2 weeks (literally 80 hours of work) to do prior and since the automation, they take about 20 minutes now.

It feels like I've been on ""cruise control"" for over a year now. I spend the majority of my day getting up later, surfing the web, going for walks, lifting, and maybe playing a video game here and there.

My boss needed help, so I volunteered some of my time for a new account. The new assignment is over-the-top chaos, appears to be a lot of work, I have to learn a bunch of new things, etc. Because I haven't ton much over the past few months, I have zero desire to do anything work-related.

How do you flip that switch to want to learn again and do hard work? I have zero desire to really dig in and do any of it.","I’ve been in a similar situation in a similar industry. 

It’s all about perspective. Don’t look at it as flipping a switch to do hard work. Instead view it as building your reputation, legacy, helping your boss / developing that relationship. Think about what you *can* gain from this experience and focus on maximizing that.

Some additional advice. Find something you’re passionate about and the next time you’re less busy - pursue that. I’d recommend a side hustle / business that can get you paid outside your wage paying gig. Multiple income streams = security + flexibility.","Tough one. Being in a good space financially and career wise makes it seem like you have everything you've ever wanted. You've probably attained all your goals you've set for yourself up to this point? Time to set new ones? Phd?

t3_ommucw,[Need Advice] How to make myself choose the harder but better choice for myself,"It's 4:40am right now on a Sunday and I'm realizing how much of a mess my life is.

All of these I'm aware that they may all result in my early death. I'm also aware that I can make better choices by doing the opposite of those but why can't I? Why can't I choose something that'll better myself it just doesn't make sense to me. I just want this to stop. I want to get better and be disciplined with my life.","Your mind hates uncomfortable things right now, but in the future not so much. That's called the present bias. The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the ""pain"" associated with those.

For bad habits, it will take discipline, but there are some things you can do:

As you've pointed out, bad habits are almost always coping mechanisms. So what are the emotions, events and situations that are at the root? If you can tackle even some of those, you should see less of the bad behaviour. 

Second, try to find an alternative. 

For a better understanding: smoking and eating can help deal with stress. That goes back to prehistoric times when there was often danger. If you were eating, it was because you found a safe place to do so. Even today eating or smoking send signals to your brain like ""I'm eating/chewing, so I must be safe right now"" which helps against stress.

Chewing gum would give you a similar effect but without the bad consequences.

And probably the easiest thing to start with, change your environment. What barriers can you put in place that make the bad behaviour harder to do or unpleasant? And how can you make the good choices easier to do?

It's gonna take time to break bad habits, but it should get better once you start seeing some results.","One step further: actually reward yourself. When I started running I rewarded myself with a TV show I wasn't allowing myself to watch until the run, or a chocolate protein shake (I love chocolate). Find the things you love doing in the day, and save them as rewards for doing the new habit - no matter how small the new habit is."

t3_pugd66,[Need advice] How to keep my work and personal life separate?,"How do I keep my personal and work life separate? A bad day at work often spoils my mood enough to be absent at home, no matter how hard I try. My thoughts keep going back to what happened at work and how to rectify it.

And want to know if others face this issue too.",How physically active are you? When my mind is racing I find it best to get a good workout in. It will relax you.,">I often chastise myself for not being able to segregate the two. And I feel like I am the only one facing these issues.

This might be a good place to start.

What you're describing—having your home life impact how you feel at work, and vice versa—is completely normal. We are human beings, not computers. A computer can run Microsoft Excel for a while, then shut that program down completely and switch to a video game. Our human minds don't work that way. The emotions that you feel at work don't automatically shut down when you head home. And when you head to work in the morning, you can't just click ""Quit"" to turn off the emotions that you're feeling at home.

You're definitely not the only one who experiences this. A lot of people don't want to talk about it, but I'd guess that almost everyone experiences this same thing at least some of the time.

If you have a bad day at work and are still thinking about it when you get home, you might start by simply acknowledging that this is how you're feeling, and that it's totally normal. Maybe spend a couple of minutes talking to your partner about it, if that helps, just to get it out in the open and put it behind you. You might also do something that physically represents switching from work to home life, something like changing clothes or working out, something that you do every day when you get home from work.

You might try something similar if you get to work and feel distracted by personal issues. First, acknowledge that it's happening, and that it's normal. You might also create a ""start of your workday,"" routine. It could be something simple like sitting at your desk (if you work at a desk) and taking three deep breaths.

Overall, the thing that might be most helpful is to recognize that what you're experiencing is totally, completely normal, and that you're not the only person who experiences this, not by a long shot."
t3_qa4641,[Need Advice] Turned 30 recently having a hard time fixing my life,"Hey All,

Kind of looking for some advice. I just turned 30 a few months ago and I'm having a hard time moving forward/fixing my life -.-. I moved back to my hometown with my parents of about 75000 people a few years ago and haven't done much here since. I used to live in a much bigger city of about 1 million where I was doing my bachelors in geography about 10 years ago but I never ended up finishing. I have a diploma in music production which I don't do too much of anymore but I'm not really too sure what to do. Most of my childhood friends aren't around anymore or they are married with kids and I'm here just living with my parents. I do have some job experience which ranges from pizza delivery, customer service, retail, restaurant bar back, exterior painting, and a few other things from when I was much younger

I guess I'm just wondering what I should do. My parents want me to move out again at the end of the month and I'm having a hard time deciding where to go. I think I might move to a city of about 3 million people and go back to school for health sciences but I'm not too sure yet. I guess I was just wondering if anyone has had anything like this. My life really does feel like I;m kind of at the bottom of the hierarchy now even though I do have some job experience and I'm definitely not a stupid individual. I sometimes think of giving up because It would be an easy our and I sometimes have a hard time trusting others ! I'm really not a bad guy but I'm just frustrated. 

Any advice would be awesome. Thanks",,
t3_xr9mbt,[Need advice] How to develop study habits? Planing to go back to school after decades.,"I plan to go back to school after decade. I need a career change, because my current job is just not it anymore. I've been out of school for so long, I don't know how to study anymore.

Any tips?",Read Deep Work by Cal Newport. Great book on how to study. Borrow from the library. Worth buying as well. Or download free pdf from pdfdrive dot net.,"I know it seems pretty obvious, but for me, studying two weeks ahead really helps in the long run. When you are ahead, you can afford to take breaks, be sick or whatever, without getting left behind by the piles of homework. And if you are behind, catch up!!!

t3_oqoask,[NEED ADVICE] I can't focus 'cause I wait for text back.,"I've been with a guy for more than a year now. The thing, in short is that I have developed a habit of replying not too late to him since we started talking and I do expect the same in return, which sometimes he fails to do and that's okay.

When he doesn't reply me for a long time due to some reason I tend to wait for the text (not actively). It's like my subconscious mind is always waiting for the text back.

It really messes up my things as in the back of my mind I keep waiting for the text even tho i know that the reply is not important and eventually he will text me back.

So, how can I focus on my work instead of the text.
I really think I made it a habit (of waiting, leaving my things and replying).

How can I make myself understand that my work is more important than that.

Any advice?",arrange time to call him and call him after you're done working. a 1 hour call is far better than 4 hour texting,"Imagine you've already received the text back and it's friendly or flirty or loving or whatever you want it to be. How does it *feel* in your body when you imagine that? Perhaps satisfied, content, fulfilled, happy, at ease, etc.

I let my moms opinions ruin everything I’ve ever done. I have ptsd, Bi polar, depression, anxiety. It literally runs my life. Sometimes I feel suicidal for days at a time. Depression has been the normal mood since 14. I used weed and porn to cope with my shitty existence. I “attempted” suicide twice, honestly didn’t think I as gonna live past 16.

Still don’t have a “real job”. I’ve been doing Uber eats to get by, I feel like my brain is mush and I’m just roughting away. I feel so old (I know I’m not old but I’ve been cooking and doing my own laundry since like eight years old I had to be the dad of the house ok) I’m tired of thinking/feeling this way. I just want to live already, I know i have a good life to live I’ve just been dealt shit. I’m a hard worker with no motivation. I still feel suicidal, but I know I can’t kill myself now.

You have a head that wants to kill you, don’t listen to it. Fitness was my liberation, using my body. Maybe trying something new in your free time can help, or starting something old that you enjoy. Don’t think, just do more. There isn’t a cure for this disease of ours, but their is a solution. I realised every day I felt like shit because what the fuck did I do in that day but sit around, complain and feel sorry for myself. Motherfucker, I need to earn my happiness every, single, day. I need to apply treatment everyday or else I get soft, and my brain goes wild. Treatment being I need to work, workout, or do something I’m passionate about. I need to grind. Build your self worth.

I don’t know if this outlook is for everyone, but the way I see it nothing really matters in the best way possible. We are so insignificant in the timeline of human beings, I doubt my casual existence will be remembered in history. This is amazing for me, liberating. I know my depression doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, my fuckups don’t matter, what colour top I wear doesn’t matter. Obviously you can go to the full extent and go bad with this train of thought, hurt people and yourself, or you can use it to liberate yourself. What matters is how I perceive myself, and I know the truth is I can’t trust my brain. People seem to like me, I think I’m ok at some things like computer games. I know deep down under those first thoughts of Self hatred, I have it in me.

Don’t live in the past, that’s depressing. Don’t live in the future, that’s anxiety. Just do what u can do right now. It’s not about the harvest you reap, it’s about the seeds you plant. You have it in you brother, hard working and you sound like a good person. Very admirable for someone whose had a hard life.

I am in my last year of university and need to take a graduate exam to move onto masters and because of this I quit my job to dedicate more hours to studying. This was 3 months ago and I have barely studied at all. And all the hours that I should be using to study are being wasted on the things I mentioned above.

As a result of this, I stopped believing the promises I make to myself because I'll just end up sitting on the couch doing nothing either way.

Maybe write things down, every detail about how you are gonna study. How you are gonna tackle every part, be extremely practical and know your limits. Don't put too much expectations and stop planning out things roughly. Being specific will bring more clarity.

t3_yzepya,[Need Advice] Help me find a good habit tracker,"Hello! I've been trying out different habit trackers but struggle to find one that fits my needs.

I would like it to have most or all of the following functions:

- be able to add both one-time tasks and habit chains

- be able to add subtasks and -goals

- be able to add non-tracked tasks and appointments

- be able to set a deadline for tasks with reminder notifications and graphics (such as bright red text) for when a task is near its deadline

- be able to use the app as a calendar

- be able to use images or imagery

- that it has widgets

- that it works on Android


So far I've enjoyed Fabulous for habit formation. Its imagery depicting a journey really works for me. Unfortunately it's only for habits, not tasks. I really would prefer not to have to use several apps for this.

I recently found HabitNow that comes really close to what I'm looking for, but I find its graphics uninspiring and tasks only show up in the daily list if you don't assign a deadline for some reason. Also, you can only get reminders on the day of the deadline and not before, which is lacking for me.

Ideally the app would show a list of items each day like the following example:


Tuesday

Pay rent (monthly task, this day at the top and in bright red because deadline is next day)

Floss (habit tracking)

Go to the gym (also habit tracking) 

Movie night (one time task, set on this specific day) 

Buy a new umbrella (another one time task, set to show up as a reminder every day until it is completed)

I procrastinate things till last minute or start after a deadline. I know I can work better if I take things slow and properly prepare but instead waste my time. I am really bad at time management too. I need help.","I would begin by learning about procrastination and how it works. You're fighting blind if you don't comprehend what you're up against.   


The fact that procrastination is a consequence of ineffective emotional regulation can point you in the right direction.","One possible solution is that don't start with some upheaval task or don't try to finish a task at once. Tell yourself that you're gonna spend only 40 mins on this and no more even if you have really gotten into the rythm. This is because it will help your mind to condition it in a way that you'll think no matter how horrible a task is you won't spend more than 40 mins at a time. Do this with pretty much every task. Whether you love or hate it. Allot it 40 mins or any short period of time and don't extend no matter what. 

You said you know you can do better which means you have some level of confidence so sometimes people don't even start just because they think it's just a tough task. So you just need to fight that resistance. A lot of times if you're able to fight that resistance you realise that this task wasn't as tough as you thought it'd be. 

Also fear can drive people. Be fearful and really force your mind to think the consequences so that you can induce a visceral emotion in yourself about the consequences or the embarrassment you might have to face. 

Also have some hobby(small or big doesn't matter) that you can look forward to. That can help you to keep going when thinks get tough. You'll think that once you're done with all the crap you can spend some time on that and enjoy yourself. Hope this was helpful!"

t3_se5nrl,[Advice] I can't eat the 3000 calories I need every day to add mass muscle and I need advice,"I'm a guy who has generally always been insecure about his body because I was always so skinny. In fact, my low self-esteem from being skinny made me miss out on a lot of opportunities in general and I even stopped going to the beach with my friends because I looked humiliating (or that's what I thought). 

Now, I'm not so skinny anymore and I've started to build my self-esteem because I've met amazing people in my life who have supported me and let me see that I'm actually ""attractive"". 

I know attractiveness has nothing to do with it, but at least I know consciously that I'm not the monster I imagined. 

I have managed to improve my grades, I have begun to dress better and the way I like it, I have begun to get a hairstyle that I like and that suits me, and in general I am happy. 

HOWEVER, I still have the last and most complex, and that is to increase muscle mass even if it is very small. I just want to have some muscles (I don't want too much either). 

The problem is that my high school is far from my house and I always get up very early and stressed to get there. 
Therefore, I have a bad breakfast.

Any advice to those who are now following a diet and going to the gym?","Hey man, the easiest way to up your calories is through calorie dense food. Try adding a tablespoon or two of natural peanut butter to smoothies or protein shakes, a bit of olive oil to salads or roasted veggies, and snack on nuts. 

Whole milk is also really great for gaining mass. Decently calorie dense with a good amount of protein and fats.

Other healthy, calorie dense foods with decent protein include avocado, chicken with the skin on and naturally oily fish.","First off, how much did you eat before 3000 calories?

You've got the human anatomy working against you. Stomach distensibility (how the stomach stretches when you eat food) is something that you can't change overnight. For underweight people, their stomach barely stretches so it feels painful to eat more than their usual portion. For overweight people, their stomach stretches a lot so eating less than usual makes them feel excessively hungry.

This is why you should go with a gradual increase in calories. Plus, the bigger your calorie surplus is, the more fat you're putting on, not muscle. Your ideal surplus should be about 300-500 kcal above your maintenance per day, irrespective of how much you weigh."
t3_11xxjim,[Need Advice] How can I summon the same motivation I have for fitness to academic tasks?,"I'm someone who has endless energy for working out and fitness, like will do it to an almost excessive amount, always happy to do it, don't care much about pain, love pushing myself and trying to break PRs. However, getting me to sit down and do any kind of work or academic task is like pulling teeth. I hate it, I feel anxious about it, I do it for 5 minutes and my brain is screaming at me to quit and do something fun. I have the ability to succeed academically when I apply myself, it just feels like a near impossible task to ever sit down and do it whenever it's not a high stakes situation. How can I channel even a fraction of the discipline and enthusiasm I have for fitness into studying and learning?","Hey there! 

This is a fantastic question. 

Although I’m now doing college consulting and academic coaching, I no no longer teach in a classroom setting. 

Nonetheless, I’ve noticed a lot of my students have the same problem you have. They can listen to an interesting documentary about the fall of Babylon because it’s fun; or, they can read gushy romance manwhas in class for forever and a half.

However, even 2 minutes writing an analytical essay on Of Mice and Men is like pulling teeth! 

I believe this is because students are often unfamiliar with the different kinds of motivation. There’s the “fun” motivation and there’s the “flow state” motivation. (These aren’t official terms btw I just made them up) 

Fun motivation is when you’ve finished grading papers for the day and can sit at home playing Skyrim for hours until night. Your mind finds the activity engaging and therefore can do it for a long period of time. 

The “flow state” of motivation is when your mind is at peace. There’s no distractions; and, you can do seemingly boring tasks for a long stretch of time. You’re not really happy; but, you’re not in pain either. You’re just at peace. A good analogy for this is to think of long distance running. The first bit sucks. But, later on, you don’t really feel fatigued from running anymore. It’s not super good or bad; it just… is. 

The flow state may never be as engaging as fun. Academic tasks may never be as fun as fitness. Learning about derivatives is probably not as fun as playing God of War. 

But, you can condition yourself to become accustomed to the flow state. So, you mind can bear the burden of boredom and find it tolerable rather than torture. 

One method I recommend for this is to eat bland food. It sounds weird. But, next time you have to decide what to eat, choose the second best option. 

Sushi —> cooked salmon 
In n Out Burgers —> Mc Donald’s
Boba —> Lemonade

The reason you do this is to condition the mind to get accustomed to not having its way. It’ll learn that not having the #1 choice isn’t the end of the world. You can apply this principle elsewhere as well. 

Need to take a break? Don’t play video games. Instead, sleep or take a walk. This compromise can help the mind be less spoiled and be more likely to do boring tasks even if it doesn’t want to, making the flow state easier. You can also apply the principle of depriving instant gratification to the Pomodoro method and many others. 

Also, final note: remember that this is going to take time. Your mind doesn’t get trained within a day, and you’re going to have days of relapse. A good analogy is fitness and bodybuilders. They often have days when they can be disciplined such as cutting for a show. But, they relapse every so often! It’s natural, and mistakes are going to be part of the process! 

Let me know if you have any questions at all!","Your narratives (I hate it, it makes me anxious, its not fun) are probably acting as a self fulfilling prophecy.
      
Definitely need to reframe those to stimulate the reward centres of your brain. 
      
Try breaking academic tasks into small chunks (eg 20mins at a time to do one tasks) so that you can get a sense of reward from smashing them out. 
      
With practice it does become easier. It's brain training to push past the 5 minute point and every time you do it you get better at it."

This creates a lot of chaos for me and I'm also not very skilled at figuring out how to best spend my time. We're successful, but we should be doing more.

What I'm looking for - either a business coach or an accountability partner who can help me figure out the highest revenue producing activities and help me plan each day so that it becomes my main focus. 

I suspect I need to hire a coach. Basically someone that can lead me through exercises to define my daily/weekly/monthly tasks and projects, and how to determine how much time to spend on each.

Does anyone know of a service (or person) that can assist in helping someone in my situation? I don't need motivation or encouragement. I just need someone that has a process for determining where I should be spending my time and helping me structure my days.

Thank you so much. Love this sub!","It's actually very simple: every night, before you sleep, take a paper and a pen. 

Then write everything you want to do tomorrow.


Then put a ""T"" in the priorities. (T of TOP)

Then sleep.

When you wake up, start make the ones you put the ""T"".

And ""check"" It with the pen, in the paper.","Huh? I have a personal trainer, accountant, financial advisor, etc. Why not have someone that can help me plan my day?"

I keep my phone outside of my room (where my desk is) inside my bag by the front door. It's many walks away from me when I'm working which makes it inconvenient to use.

t3_qnn5nw,[Need advice] I’m not even functional under pressure. Only when threatened,"I’m failing miserably at work. Like, I can go days stressed but without doing a single thing and obviously it’s becoming a problem at work. Only when my boss threatens to fire I get motivated, but that motivation only lasts a couple of days.

Needless to say, I don’t even like my job. I am a lifestyle journalist so I have a lot of cool perks like gifts from luxury brands, trips, dinners at expensive restaurants. I have a totally glamorous life I couldn’t afford on my income. But other than that, I’m miserable. 

What can I do to be able to work like a normal person?","I have ADHD, so I have to basically give myself small windows of time to do specific tasks with “rewards.” Otherwise I experience similar stalling out.","life feels like a boring chore when I don't have gratitude for things. when gratitude is lost, my mind is only capable of coming up with excuses of why I shouldn't do the thing. I realised recently that I only accomplish goals and projects that I feel truly inspired to do. even if I need to come up with a narrative to tell myself of why THIS project is so important, for example if it's for somebody else I may feel more compelled to do a thing for them if I feel they deserve it. but what's really empowered me is finding all the reasons I want to complete these tasks that are for me, with my own vision in mind, visualizing it and bringing it to life is much easier than doing a measly task that somebody else told you to do a certain way. have fun and just know it takes practice so start with getting the gratification from completing small tasks and remember that your brain is hard wired currently to get gratification in more immediate ways so it won't be happy about this new delayed gratification thing for a while but stick with it, it takes6 weeks to rewire old habits"
t3_109wkgv,"[Need Advice] I am slowly losing all respect for myself. I genuinely feel that no one respects me, because I have nothing to be respected. Only my parents trust me, and it hurts me they do, because I'm not worthy of that trust. I'm good at nothing.","I don't know where to begin. I don't think I'm good at anything. I'm not useful to anyone. I stay at home, enrolled in a distance learning university course, but I don't study at all. I have not been studying for the last 5-6 years, since I was in school. I even did my last year of school twice, and right now I'm failing my last two semesters, and I haven't told anyone about it at my home. I'm hiding it, and thinking that I'll pass those subs next semester, but I don't think I can. I just don't study. I know the solution is to just study, but no matter how much I think or plan about it I can't do it. I always start, and can't continue. I have no self control. I even made this goal to study 10 min previous year a day, and I can't follow it.

But the problem is not just about studying. I don't do anything else. I go to play some sport, and I always find myself to be worse than everyone else. My friends also play with me, and they are improving while I'm not and trust me I try to get better. I have lost the respect I once had of being a good player. Now no one even thinks about me, and no one wants to take me in their team. I feel like an outcast. I also go to the gym (and this is the only good decision I made almost 6 months ago), and for the last two months my partner has been lifting more than me, and I just don't push. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel unable to push my limits in the gym even when I try. I'm doing worse than I used to. And my partner also doesn't talk with me like he used to. He was my best friend, and now he just doesn't make any conversation with me. I try to talk with him, and he would answer my questions, but will not start the conversation from his side unless it's really necessary, and friends aren't supposed to be like this I think. I feel like I have lost a best friend because I used to be very careless when I talked to him before. I said anything, and most of the time I used to talk negative about things. Maybe this got him and now things aren't same between us. Also when I go to play sports, even there people aren't any bit attentive towards me. I don't feel like going to play sports anymore. I don't wanna improve my sports anymore. I feel sad about it and it hurts when I realise what I'm thinking, but it's true. Genuinely, inside of me, I just don't want to play sports anymore or push myself at gym. I feel unable to.

Most importantly, everyone around me doesn't treat me with any respect. I can tell, because nobody pays attention to me. No one listens carefully when I speak. Maybe I have got myself in a bad company, but then I think why would anyone respect me? What do I have to contribute? Nothing. I am only wasting my parents money day by day, and returning nothing to the outside world. I only use my screens all day, waste time watching pornography or browsing reddit or some other shit, and just want comfort. Now I know if I start doing some things and tried to establish some good habits then things will change, but I have been thinking like this and trying to change myself for the last 6 years, and I think I have gotten worse. I think something is highly wrong with me, because I just can't do things I want to do. Why am I like this? I have no respect for left for me, and I don't know why I am writing this. Maybe I just want to tell someone how I feel. I feel completely destroyed from inside. Day by day my respect decreases for myself. I try to not compare myself with anyone but myself, but then I think I'm extremely slow and if others can improve then I should too. 6 years is a lot of time. I am only escaping my reality, and when I face it then I go back to escaping it even harder.

Due to this mentality, I am not eating well, and taking care of myself. I don't even want to take shit on time, it's this bad. What do I do? I feel extreme sadness. I feel like I'm depressed.","Hi there. Are you a woman? Have you had your blood tested for vitamin D, B, iron levels, TSH? I found that my inability to concentrate was in fact due to very low iron levels. Basically, I was running on less oxygen than everyone else for years. It didn't matter how much I wanted to do stuff, I just couldn't. It also made me feel depressed. Also, are you on birth control pills? A lot of women in recent years found out that made them depressed as well.

I think before you conclude it's just your motivation, rule out any physiological causes, because you won't be able to will yourself out of a biological problem or deficiency. You may even have had it for so long you think your energy levels are normal when they're not (and people will look down on you for being lazy and unmotivated when it's really not in your control at all).

Also that's why it's even more important that you start to eat regularly and healthy again, even if you don't feel like it, because motivation really is tightly coupled to your energy intake. Eat well.","I am a man. I will try to rule out any physical causes. From now on I am making my physical health my top priority. I will try to eat well, and I will eat on time. I will also try to take care of my health in any way I can. Drink water properly, maintain good posture(this is very imp, because I can't even sit while I'm eating), sleep well, etc. Thanks for this new insight. I don't know why I didn't think about it for so long. I really want to get better."

t3_v37kpt,[Need Advice] How to resist the urge to eat?,"I read the post about masturbation and it kind of put me in front of my problem: eating. Too much.
How to resist cravings? Like leftovers, etc… 
Send help. Right now I can only stay between 2.000 and 2.500 kcal while I should be at 1.500/1.7000.
I usually eat out of boredom. 

Any tips?","You have to know why you're eating. Are you bored? Is it emotional eating? Scarcity mindset? Body image problem? Eating disorder? Depression/anxiety?

You can't fix the problem until you know what it is. Eating is just the symptom."," A someone who struggled with dissorderd eating, imposing more restrictions when you are already (physically OR mentally) restricting WONT help your cause. For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.

When you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.

What helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very ""unhealthy"" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.

During that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot ""fail"" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. 

Btw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.

I know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.

F the bikini body, your happiness is more important. Treat the issue (could be anything, you gotta figure it out on your own), not the symptom (overeating)."

Now I have some troubles getting back to my routine. I can hardly wake up on time and I am so so tired. I used to do lots of things but now even the bare minimum is hard. 

Any tips?","First, it is important to realize that vacation is good for you and it is ok to recharge and relax. That is the purpose of the vacation. 

Maybe biggest mistake was that you ruined your sleep schedule but that will correct itself soon. Don't snooze etc. You will be tired few days but eventually body adapts and pick up new schedule again. Remember to eat enough healthy food to fuel your body. 

Mindset : Decide that vacation is over, it was temporary and now you have work period again and that daily routine is what you need to follow now.","Hmm, now that you're asking these questions I might get a better picture.

 I stayed at home during the vacation to recharge my batteries. I still went to sleep at my usual time (10PM) but woke up relatively late (8 or 9AM, compared to 6 or 7AM) so idk if this threw off my sleep schedule?

No drinking, I might've enjoyed a glass of cider every noe and then but not to that extent.

t3_130arkx,[Need Advice] How do you resist the urge to procrastinate after finally starting on a task?,"When I finally push myself on doing a certain task, I only end up doing it for a minimal period.

t3_t1rhmp,[Need Advice] How to deal with 'What makes you think you can do X' comments? AM I too stand-offish?,"Today I spoke to my mom about my dreams of going overseas to work and experience the culture.

My mom just went 'what makes you think its so easy'

Like, I know it's not easy, but can she just let me dream? I've never had such a big want before. The last time was in high school, and it's the same shit I got from my mom 'what makes you think you can be come a club president?' I never became the president, but I became the vice, and the president gave me full authority to handle training, events and competition while she spoke to the teachers, coaches etc.

Seriously. 'You can do sponsorship?' 'are you really that good a pianist?' 

I get it tho, that she's tired. I've not completed my degree yet at 27, and it's honestly difficult cuz I hate what I'm studying and I regret making the 'practical' choice. Also I've been working and have an online business while doing all this.

I just answered: what's wrong with dreaming big?, Look, if I want to do it, then I'll give it a go. At least I've tried even if I don't make it.' while I really wanted to say 'If you don't want to help, shut it.'

I realise now that this whole time, I've been waiting for her validation. I shouldn't be waiting, and I should head out and leave people with her kind of attitude behind. Got called an idiot for not knowing to cook when they wouldn't even alow me into the kitchen. 'We give you freedom' but that never actually happened. I had enough. I'm not waiting for their validation, praise, approval anymore. 

My school experience was the same: I trained my sopranos while my coach worked on the altos, she called me rude. I was the Head of stage managent for a uni event. There were boxes of sponsored items backstage, and no one informed us. I called the sponsorship team but no one picked up, so I moved the sponsored items out cuz we needed the space. As a result, some of the items got stolen. I got called stupid, and I gave them hell. 

It makes me standoff-ish, but I'm slowly realising I don't have a choice. (advice needed, DO I have a choice?). Standoff-is should have been my default mode. I need to learn to act without their validation.

As my friend said: people who aks you 'what makes u think u can do X' don't know what it takes to be great.

Advice on how to move forward?
- My habits are in sort of in place, working on it but it's slowly getting better.
- still dunno what I want to do, but I'm exploring slowly. Literally, I've asked God, bazi and tarot cards too. 
- how do u all deal with comments like my mom's?","You're 27. You should be putting this time and effort into your goals not asking strangers how to feel about what a person they don't know anything about feels about your goals.

Maybe your mom is mean... Maybe she's seen you lose interest or bite off more than you could chew one too many times.. We don't know. All the character analysis you got on her above are just assumptions and projections.

Your question was what to do about the comments and my answer is 'nothing'. 
You're an adult. 
You should set goals on your own, go after them on your own, earn them on your own. If people cheer you on or doubt you shouldn't matter.","> What makes you think you can do X?

Analysis Paralysis seems to be what you have. Possibly depression.

Setting aside a third space away from home like the library or coffee shop and blocking out time to plan steps… small steps in achieving what you need to do will help. It allows you to make small victories. “Therapy in a nutshell” is a good YouTube resource and “healthygamergg” on anxiety.

If you have things that saps up your dopamine and wearing your energy out line social media, tv, video games, drugs, alcohol, or pornography it’s time to ween off those.

Finding a job will be a lengthy process so you’d need to set expectations for that. Getting a professional resume reviewer and person to cater you to the right job with realistic expectations can help as well. You can find one for less than $150. It’s worth it. As they write your resume with your notes or update your old one.

Exercise especially running at the gym on a treadmill can be a keystone habit towards weightlifting. They are basically both attacking your paralysis through body chemistry and giving you mindfulness. Along with nutrition, sleep routine. 

If you’re on low income find a therapist to talk things out and map your actions.

Deep focus is something that needs to a lot of work as well. Where you are in a mode of just getting things done without excessive over thinking. Look up atomic habits and deep focus books also short summaries can be found on YouTube.

Meditation and yoga Excercise can also help you emotionally regulate as well.


I have your problem right now as well. In a different situation switching jobs and needing to study. But with deep analysis paralysis and no drive.

Small things that helped me are above especially exercise. Doctors all diagnosed with clinical depression and it’s something that takes time to address.

I wish you peace and strength on your journey","I am in the exact same position as you. Crippling mental health issues that are getting the better of me and preventing me from moving forward in my life all while being worried about time running away from me, which it is and fast. I can't give you any proper meaningful advice because if it was good advice I wouldn't be in this situation. 

One day at a time. Grab a pen and paper one night and just make a small list of things you would like to achieve. Don't make them big things, make them little things. Me for example, the other night, I wrote this list and put on it

- write a resume/CV 
- go for a walk every morning for 15 mins
- do laundry and tidy your room

You get the idea, once you achieve these little things, the big tasks won't seem so daunting. Something else I've been doing to fight my anxiety is go into the city or town whatever it is you have where you live and force yourself to talk to people. Anyone at all. 

As for motivational videos on YouTube, they won't really help too much. They are just videos made by people trying to capitalise on your rut for the most part. The only person that can help you fully achieve your goals is yourself. And you can do that, it just takes willpower. I've done it before and fell down and i WILL get back up again. 

I do recommend looking into stoicism. It can help greatly with the way you think and the way you approach problems. 

I wish you all the best"
t3_127c77r,[Need Advice] The cure for hypersomnia.,"I have the opposite problem of most modern adults. I don't struggle with sleep. Quite the opposite - I struggle with hypersomnia. Basically given the option I will seek out sleep and desire it pretty much all the time. It's unique from simply being ""tired"". I've had days where for one reason or another I didn't get good sleep and I can differentiate between ""I did not get quality sleep"" and ""I have gotten plenty of sleep but still feel sleepy"". 

Thus far all medical explanations have fallen flat. Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. Frankly I think it's mostly behavioral that stems from past depression (when I slept a lot simply for lack of desire to do anything else). That depression has waned but the sleep issue persists. It interferes with work (I can near automatically shut off alarms even when I add obstacles, I can fall into a nap after laying down only a minute or two, and so I tend to overslept and miss even things I want to do). 

Things I've tried: I try covering my bed with stuffed animals during the day as a deterent but they're easy to toss aside. I try keeping myself generally bust during the day though this isn't always practical (and doesn't help in the morning when the battle is hardest). Anything I would use to stay awake when I reach the point where my brain says ""sleep"" I will just remove them to get the sleep. Even if I know I will feel worse afterward (for those who don't know if you get too much REM you can become essentially ""sleep drunk"" and it's not enjoyable or helpful).",">Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. 

That doesn't mean it's not narcolepsy. Have you seen an actual sleep specialist?","It sounds like you need a sleep study, both a PSG and MSLT. I have narcolepsy and it basically means your brain doesn’t regulate your sleep-wake cycle appropriately. Narcolepsy can also just mean that you feel sleepy almost all the time (this is more or less how it is for me) or may even have sleep attacks (the unmistakable feeling that you just have to take a nap right now) or it can be some of both. The image of a person just suddenly collapsing into sleep is due to severe cataplexy which is a defining feature of narcolepsy type 1, and what the brain is doing is slipping into REM as a result of an emotional response. That person is also simultaneously conscious and awake. When you go into REM your muscles kind of weaken and paralyze so you don’t act out your dreams, and that’s what’s happening with cataplexy. It can also be very mild where one might feel their legs weaken or knees buckle when laughing or when someone get frustrated and they drop whatever is in their hand because they lose muscle grip. Narcolepsy type 2 generally looks like being excruciatingly sleepy all day. I have type 1, my sister has type 2. We’re both really damn sleepy but also sleepy in slightly different ways. Narcolepsy can come with it’s own insomnia feature of feeling most awake at night. But that’s just part of the sleep-wake cycle dysregulation. People with narcolepsy are also likely to have too much REM sleep and skip the deep sleep stage. And you don’t need all the symptoms, you could literally just be sleepy all the time and be diagnosed with it. Then there is also narcolepsy’s cousin idiopathic hypersomnia which is basically “We don’t know why, but you’re just pathologically sleepy”. It can look a lot like narcolepsy and narcolepsy can look a lot like it. Depression is common for both. Both disorders can be diagnosed and medicated.

I chose to not take meds because I get a lot of side effects from stimulants, so I manage with lifestyle choices. The biggest one for me is diet. Too many carbs and sugar and I’ll be a sleepy zombie. Too much pizza for dinner will result in being completely unproductive the following day. Caffeine too late into the afternoon, after 3pm will diminish my quality of sleep that night. I’ll sleep but my quality of sleep is terrible. Exercising and staying active is extremely difficult and too much can put me under, but just doing light exercise will help in the long run once I’m in the habit and get over the initial sleepiness hurdles. Anything drowsy inducing is off limits, avoid meds with drowsiness as a side effect which sucks when you have allergies, although antibiotics are unavoidable, and limit alcohol or just don’t drink at all. Knowing how much to sleep has helped tremendously. I function best at between 6-7 hours, less and I feel like hell, and more than 8 and I have sleep drunkenness all day and feel a different kind of hell. You can try to experiment with any of those.

But seriously, get yourself to a doctor and request a sleep study if you need a referral. Ask for both a PSG and a MSLT. Have a two week sleep log ready to go, and you can even show up with a self-administered Epworth Sleepiness Scale results. If your score is in the 8-10 range that’s common for sleep apnea, if you’re in the 17+ range you’re in the narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia range. Feel free to drop on by the narcolepsy sub in which we support folks with IH also. I’ve heard your story dozens of times, it’s common in our community. Don’t cheat yourself out of a potentially better life."

As recommended earlier in this thread set small goals. If you have a goal for where you want to be, even a small step forward is okay. Try to set your goals tied to doing the process rather than what you “should” look like. When you do the latter you’re constantly living in a state of not succeeding at your goal which will add stress to an already stressful life. Learning to love the process and using the scale as a metric to refine your process rather than define yourself is a helpful headspace. Examples of where to start could look like “for the next three months I will walk for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week” or “for the next three month I will stick to a meal plan and not snack 3/7 days a week”."
t3_10ecn4n,[Need Advice] My issues are spiraling out of control,"I need to change, but I’m not sure how, or rather where to start.

There are a bunch of issues, some more recent than others. It just seems like they’re culminating in a way now, making the overall situation worse.

&#x200B;

I procrastinate to the point of being self-destructive. For a long time, throughout school and beyond, putting things off over and over worked out perfectly fine, because with a little bit of last-minute crunch I was able to achieve most things, and the consequences for when I couldn’t were mild. In hindsight, this never forced me to develop the necessary skills and discipline for working continuously on projects, or myself in general. What little I have in that regard has been a struggle to acquire. However, it’s not even universal. I absolutely hate going to the gym, but I still do it regularly anyway. So, objectively, I can get off my ass repeatedly. I have some methods to restrain myself. But more often than not, I push of the important things over and over. Sometimes critically important things. So much so that it seems like I don’t care about myself at all. Going out of my way for other people is no problem, for me though…

&#x200B;

I have developed some agarophobia during the pandemic, and probably anxiety about confronting people, f.e. clerks for bureaucratic concerns, doctors appointments and so on. I’ve always been introverted, but not averse to people in general. Ever since the lockdowns, going out somewhere is suddenly a matter of discipline. Some instance in my brain just doesn’t want me to go anywhere, and I have to force myself through that every time, even though it’s not even particularly bad. Of course, this exacerbates the procrastination.

&#x200B;

I lie, reflexively, all the time, and then commit to those lies unnecessarily. About my plans for the day, about how I’m feeling, how a particular thing is progressing, a bunch of different things, really. Upon reflection, those lies seem to aid all the things above, as well as being more comforting than the truth for people around me. As if, in the moment, lying is quicker than explaining myself thoroughly, while the truth just makes the other party concerned, but still unable to help anyway. On top of this idiocy, I then commit to those lies to appear consistent, like having said I’m going to X at a certain time, and then “having to” go somewhere, like to public library, and working on something that isn’t even urgent.

&#x200B;

I waste time, instead, with things that aren’t even important to me. When I put off a phone call and rather start cooking something elaborate and then thoroughly enjoy it with other people, it’s still not ideal, but I’m mostly fine with it. Most of the time though, a part of my brain just seem to go like “avoid X at all cost” and fills the space “until” X with anything and everything. Youtube, games, chats with people, cleaning, researching, reading, doomscrolling, walking… Anything trivial. The large majority of which I won’t even remember the day after. Concerning is, how oftentimes I don’t even register that I’m purposefully avoiding something in the moment. It’s like being on autopilot, or a drunken binge. REALLY concerning is, that even when I do realize what I’m doing (or rather not doing) I can’t reliably lift myself out of it, and start. If I do, it is incredibly taxing. If I don’t, it feels almost dissociative, like I’m bewildered how I don’t care enough about this/myself.

&#x200B;

I also might have dampened my emotional responses somehow. When observing other people, having similar issues, they’re kickstarted into action by strong emotions, even without discipline. Their pride, self-loathing, feeling of obligation, spite, or concern about themselves or others are a strong impetus. Like a safety line, before things get too out of hand. I do have these feelings, but I sometimes wonder why they are so soft, and incongruent with the circumstances. I know this isn’t the solution to the overall problem, said people still procrastinate after all. But it contributes to my confusion how to approach this in general.

&#x200B;

I’m not clinically depressed. I really wish I was, that would be a comparatively easy solution. But that’s been eliminated by a psychiatrist for a while. I can’t seek psychiatric help either, though. In my country, ever since the lockdowns, those services have been utterly overwhelmed. If you’re not suffering severely, or aren’t a risk to yourself, or others, there’s simply no space at the moment. Waiting lists for appointments are 6-8 months. However, I need to do something NOW. Even more so, if I need to start with incremental change, which, unless any of you can provide a different epiphany, I obviously do.

&#x200B;

So, I’m turning to this corner of the internet, to see if any of you kind people have experience and input that could be helpful for me. Objectively, I’m good at assessing my situation and what needs to be done, what my needs are, how to provide for them properly, etc. What I struggle with is the application, the methods, the battle between my brain tricking me, and me tricking my brain. And figuring out where to start in this mess. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.

(Also, this has bloated a lot. If you’ve read this far, that deserves a Thank you all on its own. So thank you.)","Hey, I have been having similar feelings since the pandemic. I can really relate to your post and sadly I don't have much advice to offer. But know that you're not alone in this.","Unfortunately, I have experienced the same struggles with discipline. Regardless of what issue I was trying to solve, be it drinking, pornography addiction, not focusing on my education, I just couldn't stay motivated to keep at it. It was a never ending cycle of me not feeling proud of myself. It also doesn't help that I couldn't seem to find any meaning in my day to day actions.
  

  
Something that really helped me was setting short term goals for myself instead of big commitments. It made me feel optimistic and much more enthusiastic about my commitment to improve myself. I really believe focusing on doing something hard regularly is key to gain control. I urge you guys to also set yourself some attainable 
  
standards which you can pursue, instead of blowing the expectations you have for yourself to an unreachable degree.
  

  
I will share a resource which has helped me, and hopefully it can help you too. The website is provocatio.net, and they basically give you instructions on what physical exercises to do during the week. It gave me structure and mental strength which reminds me that I am improving as an individual.
  

  
Good luck guys. Hopefully we all become stronger."
t3_oh4l5b,[NEED ADVICE] Constantly self sabotaging and giving up on projects/career prospect when I start to get good at it.,"Context: Growing up, I was constantly praised for being “smart” because I enjoyed many things (especially creative endeavors) and being praised for them helped me excelled at many of the things I do. This is a double edge sword because I tend not to try as hard, often relying on my “talent” when needed and only picking up things that peak my interest or doing things I know I’ll be good at (thus, receiving more praise). The ego, I know. 

Well, fast forward to the ensuing detrimental consequences that is my current present, I [22F] have dropped out of college (because I didn’t enjoy it and felt like it was a waste of time and money) and have since picked up many interesting projects and explored many business ideas and have excelled in them but once I reach a point where they are considered “good/successful” I give up because I no longer enjoy it. This really sucks because I can’t build anything for myself long term and I can’t work towards anything in the long run. I really envy those who can work on a project for years (and enjoy it) and end up with something to show for it. Tbh, I really do try to push myself forward with it but it feels as though there is a huge wall of resistance pushing me back and I find myself hating the project or I’ll procrastinate. I’m not sure if there is some hidden insecurity or fear of failure thats holding me back… not to mention I have horrible self discipline. Any advice at all will be appreciated!",,
t3_zoz1hu,[Need Advice] How can I get disciplined when I don't care about my goals?,"Repost because I forgot flair, sorry

I understand that motivation is fleeting. I understand one needs to use discipline instead, to do it even if they don't feel like it.

The problem is, I don't even get fleeting motivation. I understand motivation is not helpful for actually completing tasks, but I get the sense that it's somewhat necessary for original goal setting. I can't set meaningful goals at all.

There's nothing I really want. Sure, every once in a while I think something might be nice, but then I think a little harder about what actually would happen, and realize that I actually am not interested in it at all. For example, I might randomly think ""hey wouldn't it be cool to play the piano"" but I have no real desire or emotion attached to it, and once I picture myself having learned to play the piano, I wouldn't want to play anyway, I wouldn't care that I could play, I just wouldn't really get anything out of it at all. That's not even counting all the effort in hypothetically learning how to play. I can't think of any goal that would really have any long term positive benefit that would outweigh the upfront pain and discipline.

This makes goal setting seem like an exercise in futility. Every single idea I come up with seems as random and pointless as if I randomly strung together a sentence. Getting better at math or reading a book or whatever, when I truly don't care about it and don't see any way I could apply the skills to get any benefit, looks exactly the same to me as ""My goal will be... 'Balance'... 'Shoe'... 'Under'... 'Knee'"". My response is always immediate bewilderment and a resounding *why?!*

I swear, I don't need a huge why. I regularly push through pain at work because an employee gets the job done until they decide to formally quit. I respond to emails and texts promptly no matter how anxious or busy or whatever I am because it shows respect. I do fine with health-related goals, because I can see the benefits of having more strength and energy, and ultimately staying healthy and independent for longer.

The problem is with self-improvement or overall living a more disciplined life, things I know I ""should"" do but can't really find any reason why. I'm just not a very disciplined person. I know discipline > motivation. But I just don't understand what the point of, for example, developing a hobby is, if all it really is doing something you hate just so you can get better at something you hate just for what, masochism brownie points?

This lack of discipline is starting to become even more problematic. I'm at an age where I need to apply to colleges and decide what I'm going to do, and I just can't bring myself to study and apply anymore. I've never had problems in school in the past, but I just can't see any benefits of going to college vs going to trade school. I have no interests, as long as I make enough to eat it's all the same to me. So it's not that I don't want to work on applications, it's that I don't want the applications to be done. I don't want to get good grades. It's suddenly very hard to muster up discipline to work towards things I don't actually want to happen.

I've tried just pushing through and following random goals for the discipline. I always heard that motivation will eventually follow action. This never happens. I start off trying to ignore my misgivings and just do it, over time (like for months, I am giving it a bit of a chance) I come to hate it more and more, and eventually the stress of trying to continue force myself starts carrying over into other areas of my life, until finally I admit that I hate it and I'm not going to get any foreseeable benefits and it's only getting worse. I give in and show that I don't have discipline after all. This hits especially hard with hobbies, because they require so much discipline, and there's no real reason for them other than personal fulfillment and enjoyment, which I never feel no matter how long I force myself or how good I get.

Then I hear on here that it never ends. You always have to use discipline. It's always a struggle. I just don't understand why I should try to be disciplined, if I'll always only struggle and never get any benefit.

People always say that the pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret, but what do you do when you genuinely just don't feel regret? Admittedly I'm young, but I've never regretted missing out on opportunities or not doing enough. I've only ever regretted working so hard at things that didn't matter, I wish I could've rested and relaxed more, and I wish I wouldn't have ruined the few interests I had trying to turn them into hobbies. I've always been more laid-back and don't really dwell on potential life paths anyway. Nothing is really important to me except my health which I already work to maintain, nothing really interests me enough to outweigh the pain of discipline.

With this attitude, it's very difficult to see why I should even bother. I know that ultimately I'm just whining, but I was just wondering if anyone knew what could help with this, or at least if anyone else is in the same boat? Is there anything I'm just not thinking of? Is it really just an unrealistic expectation to have a reason or a bit of motivation while setting goals? If they won't be meaningful anyway, what goals do I set, how do I even know I'm setting the right ones? Or am I just making a lot of excuses and I just need a swift kick in the pants lol

t3_ujj9vn,[Need Advice] How to control your sexual desires and urges,"I'm a young 23 years old single Man. I don't have a much active dating life, and I'm a virgin. 
But that's not the issue, I'm fine with being single, I'm focused on my goals and life. 
But sometimes I have these intense sexual urges, and I would usually mastrubate

But I have gone no Fap for almost a week and don't plan on giving up easily this time

But I still get these sexual urges when I see someone hot in real or on social media or randomly during night

How do I stop this or get a control over it? 

Would really appreciate help here!","Bro i suggest you one thing....
Forget about nofap.... 
Nofap is not something that you do..
Have you notice that whenever you work for something by giving you 100% you forget about fapping. 
That's what you should be doing. 
If you do something which means a lot to you and if you work 100% on it. Then nofap will naturally work. You don't have to think about it.
I am also going this. I wasted 2 years trying to ""do"" nofap alone. 
That's not how it work bro. Do your best on anything you love. 
All the best 🔥🔥💪💪💪","I found NoFap about 7 years ago now. Prior to it, all my roommates openly talked about porn, how many tabs they had open on their browser at night, etc. Like most early 20's males, porn was just considered normal.

I do think refraining from excessive masturbation or even masturbation at all is a good thing. Ideally you want a partner to be enjoying that shit with, but that's not an option for many in certain times of their life and that's ok too. The main issue I see with porn/masturbation for guys is they use it as a crutch. If you can just go fap to some hot internet girl, why go to the gym? Why strive for a better job? Why go out and meet real girls? Why try different things with your girlfriend or wife? All that requires effort, putting yourself out there, etc.

If you're doing it every night, multiple times a day, or using it as 'escapism' for stress or your problems when things get tough, that's when it can be an issue. However on the flip side, the NoFap community makes it out to be completely evil and like you should never fap, ever. It's very very very hard to just never do it ever again. The goal to them is to go on these 100, 200, 300+ day streaks and count days... which ultimately isn't sustainable. And when you do fail, it's very easy to really beat yourself up over it.

The better thing to focus on is ""not watching porn"" rather than ""stopping masturbation"". You don't want to be addicted to overstimulated porn images, which many times makes real sex boring and guys can't get hard. 

Per Chinese medicine there are rules for how many nuts you should be busting per every few days. I believe for someone in their 20's it's about every 3-4 days... any more and they believed you were basically ""wasting your lifeforce"". IMO, this really just means you're too focused on sex and should be focusing on other things in life.

IMO, reset your goals. Striving for 30 days or something to start is good. Make absolutely sure you know WHY you're doing this. If there's no WHY, when you're stressed, it's before bed, etc. you'll just rationalize it's ok and do it - this is why everyone fails.

Realize you're probably going to fail. Right now you'll swear up and down you won't, but 10 days in, 20 days in.... you'll give in or at least want to. That's when it really starts.

Delete any saved porn you have. Use a porn blocker to block websites as another means to stop yourself - it might not totally stop you as you can turn it off, but at least it's another step. Don't take devices into your room at night.

Biggest tip: Go do other shit. Get a main hobby. Dive more into your current hobbies. Lift. Run. You're going to have to focus on and do other things.

And good luck."
t3_rygxb9,[Need Advice] How do I un-fuck my life?,"So I'm 18, no job, and I kinda fucked up my college life. I haven't done a single thing for the first semester of college and now my second semester is coming up in a few days, and now one of my scholarship funding sources are asking for my grades. WHAT DO I DO?!

You might be wondering how this happened...well...

I have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my ""content"", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.

Another problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.

Even when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.

Now back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say ""I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester"", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say ""just do it"", but it doesn't work like that.

For stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination. Could I get some strong advice for someone who has suffered through a strong addiction of some sort?

Currently I am reading a book called “The Gap and the gain”. In it the author describes a concept where many of us are looking at the gaps in our life instead of the gains.  Here’s a scenario:  

Just suppose you’re walking along a paved highway toward a beautiful horizon.  The sun is setting just right, you feel the warm air and maybe even a gentle breeze.  As you’re walking you notice how far you’ve come, that’s living in the gain.  The opposite is focusing on how much further you have to go or living in the gap between where you are and where you have yet to go.  

When we measure success based on how far we’ve come we see what successes we have had up until now.  On the other hand, when we measure success based on how far we have to go we always feel disappointed.  Bc the thing is we can never actually get to the horizon. No matter how far we walk, run, drive.  The horizon isn’t there for us to get to. These are our ideals.  We will never actually measure up to our ideal self (which is usually ego driven). Our focus can always be on how far we’ve come and measure based on that, not how far we “feel” we have yet to go.  Which is usually based on fear of something.","1) exercise. The consistency is much more important than the amount. Do what you can.

2) Establish and follow a routine, especially in terms of your sleep schedule. Get up and get dressed every day, even if you just stay at home.

3) Practice self care. Not just the obvious stuff, either. Respecting yourself enough to keep a clean environment, practice good hygiene, and so on. It makes a surprising difference. 

4) Forgive yourself. The important part is to keep making improvements. It's about the journey much more than the destination - and sometimes we have to take a step or two backwards before we can move on. Small steps."

Talking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   
In a few days you'll love your new routine and you'll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don't have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there's always a little windows to stick something new you want to try. Be curious, test it, try new things, improvise but always follow your schedule, I like to organize my week during my sunday, this way I know exactly what have to be done in the following days, including when I'll rest.","You might wanna check out Nuj Alarm Clock.

t3_pd2sr0,[Need Advice] I cannot get started due to my intense procrastination and fear of failure.,"Some background: 
I am currently in my final year of uni and funnily enough, I know nothing about the subject I am studying. That fact alone scares me to death, accompanied by the fact that I have a massive exam coming up in 5 months and I haven’t started preparing. I know what I need to do, how to do it. But I just can't seem to get up and get it done. I get distracted easily and I think it's because I am scared of how much I actually have to do. But I cannot go on like this. 
I know that all I need is to get started. But I just cannot manage that. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I cannot go on like this.",I was diagnosed as a child. But I never received any treatment. I didn’t even know till a few months back when my mother told me that I was diagnosed as a child. It's extremely difficult for me to concentrate. Sitting at a desk or any place for more than half an hour and working is impossible. Is that because of adhd?,"Have you ever looked into ADHD as a possibility? This post and some of your post history sounds deeply familiar to me, and I have diagnosed ADHD (primarily inattentive)."
t3_13nhprw,[Need advice] I need to learn how to control and suppress emotions and feelings,"When I (30s M) have feelings, whether it be love, betrayal, happiness, sadness, etc, I feel it deeply, to the point my emotions affect my thought and decision making processes. My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.","I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.

The advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:

1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)

That's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.

2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.

3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.

Good luck!","Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don't suppress it, it will just bottle up and that's not good. Writing things helps me see it as it is and not with emotions but with logic and rationale."
t3_t1ag4b,[Need Advice] I keep having these extremely low days even though I'm very disciplined most of the time," I'm a 26 years old woman and I'm overall very hard working, high performing and disciplined. I'm working full time while studying to get my second degree, the first one was in english language teaching and the latter one is Computer Science & Engineering. I'm also learning german and I'm a licensed Muay Thai fighter. I've got a very well and balanced diet, I plan my meals carefully and prepare them every morning. I do yoga and clean up my house every morning before showering and going to work and I workout for 1.5 hours every evening, after a light walk no matter how the weather is. At work, during breaks, I try to read books. I don't drink or smoke. My hair and skincare is always on point. Everything is great!

But then, there are some days... About once in every two weeks I just can't bring myself to do anything at all for an entire day! I eat very unhealthily and eat everything I can, I eat onion rings and drink coke even though I don't even like the taste. I don't even brush my teeth or wash my face. I don't leave my bed the whole day and do nothing but watch stuff. Even though I feel absolutely disgusting and dumb on those days, even though I get bored of what I'm watching after just an hour and sick of eating disgustingly unhealthy stuff after a single bite, I just keep doing that. Even though doing so ruins my day and the day after that. Even if I can make an exciting plan for that entire day and do everything -I'm single, young pretty and I earn well, I just choose to do this and regret it after 10 minutes but still keep doing this. I don't know what's the problem with me or how I can solve this. Is anybody else like this? Any suggestions?

I’m at a loss. I do not know how to start. I have idea and I am ambitious I can feel it. I’ve gotten so lazy even though I work 6 days a week im usually always on my phone. My job is easy. I don’t even know how im still hired there. I’m so addicted to food. I’m so consumed by my phone. I’ve gotten so lazy I just do the minimum. I take 1-2 classes a quarter. I workout and eat just good enough to maintain the hard work and fitness I have worked for over the years. I make sure I am hygienic and clean. I have no motivation to do more than the minimum. I barely holding on. Procrastinating everything. I just can’t believe I spend a majority of my day staring at this fucking phone an average of 6-8 hours screen time. SIX TO EIGHT HOURS SCREEN TIME EVERYDAY . Like im zoned in and unaware of the real world. I take medication for adhd 5 days a week. Im a mess. I am trying to read more books and learn more. I just don’t know how to do this.


I have this notebook. I am writing down all my goals and bullet points on how I can achieve those goals then everyday I wanna write down my plans /to do list for the day. I also wanna use this to journal rather than use my notes app. I will still use my notes app but not as much.
I know I need to first fix my sleep. I THINK I can do that since I can look forward to sleep if im actually tired. So I think I can get that down. I know 2nd I need to reduce my
Screen time. I will do this by setting screen time restrictions on my
Phone and putting my phone far away when going to sleep. I also need to have a set food schedule. I need to  stop buying junk food for now. If someone offers a cookie, sure. But I will not willingly buy anymore junk food regularly. And I will write down what I eat and what I plan to eat. I will write out my whole plan for the day 

Now everything In between is what will make me fail. It’s the boredom and lack of motivation. Don’t give me that “it’s discipline not motivation” yeah well no shit. Why do u think depressed people are less ambitious than mentally healthy people? You can’t just say “suck it up” to everyone because it DOESNT WORK…. you think I haven’t tried to suck it up? 

What I’m asking for is brain hacks. Ways to stay on track. Ways to get shit done. How to deal with the boredom . How to stay consistent. How to stop failing. How to resist my phone. How to deal with the boredom long enough so that discipline becomes fun and easy. How to not feel excruciating boredom when I am not on TikTok or Netflix or Hulu or YouTube.  How to stop thinking of food when I am legitimately addicted to food and can’t stop thinking of it.  I wanna start now but I feel stuck. I can’t explain it I feel trapped . I feel trapped. I’m trapped. I stay stuck with these addictions and not changing, this I stay trapped. If I try to get disciplined I go crazy from boredom and anger and I hate my life because I don’t wanna fucking do the task and when I start the fucking task I take forever because my phone distracts me or I take long because the task is so boring it’s so boring boring boring  I know it will get better but for now how do I deal with this boredom?!!

PLEASE IM BEGGING U HELP ME","Disclaimer: none of this may be helpful, but I’ll give you what has worked for me at different points in my life. I’m just jotting down thoughts as they come so this might not be very organized, but the lessons/ ideas should still come thru. If you find this helpful and want me to clarify or add more things I’ve tried just reply back

I think brain hacks can help, but it seems like different ones will work at different times of your life and work for some and don’t work for others.

I have had varying degrees of laziness and problems with motivation throughout my life.

I’ve gone through periods where I’ve had nothing going on, playing video games all day and not even being able to have a sleeping routine. I tried so many ways during this period to be more productive and get out of the rut, but was unsuccessful. During this period I realized that I only was able to do things out of necessity. I had to have some kind of commitment that I was locked into and had to work towards. Like having a job that you force yourself to show up for because you don’t want to let people down and need the money. After learning this I went to the extreme and locked myself into a contract with the Air Force. I knew that once in I wouldn’t be able to just quit and I’d be forced to take action because there wasn’t another choice. My point is, you don’t need to join the military, but if you can find commitments in your life that would force you to take action maybe this could be a step in the right direction and possible solution to force yourself out of a rut.

At other points in my life the power of positive thinking helped. I read countless books over the course of years before I actually understood exactly what this meant. Anytime you look up how to get motivated or disciplined or whatever you get the same answers. Mindfulness, gratitude, positive thinking. I was always left thinking this is some blanket statement thrown out that didn’t actually mean anything and certainly didn’t help. Maybe there’s some truth to that, but regardless here’s what I learned worked for me in this realm. To me, It’s the process of changing your identity and reinforcing it. If you tell yourself and believe that you’re in shape or an athlete, it’s much easier to talk yourself into regular exercise because you believe the act of exercise is to the core of who you are. So anytime you are about to do something productive start by saying I am this, and then reinforce it with the actual act. Before you workout tell yourself I am an athlete and then reinforce it to yourself by exercising even if it’s for 10 min. Another example, tell yourself you a disciplined person and then read 10 pages of a book. Tell yourself you are mentally strong and then take a 2 min cold shower. It might sound crazy, but I’ve really noticed a difference after just a few weeks of doing this. You don’t need to do a half hour meditation routine everyday to reap the benefits of positive self talk.

On this topic, at one point of my life I was so miserable that all of my thoughts were negative. I would hold onto any failure or things I didn’t accomplish and beat myself up for it. This process of constantly thinking about the negative made me feel so much worst. I found out how much it was affecting me because one day on my way home from work I finally snapped and silenced my mind. Anytime I had a negative thought I would just shut it out. I would literally tell myself to shut up. I felt better immediately. Since then I’ve made a rule to just never think negative thoughts, I just have never found a time when they’ve been useful.

While constantly researching and trying things to change my discipline my process would usually go like this. I would learn one thing, try it, maybe it helped a bit. I’d forget about it look up some new technique, maybe it worked, forget about it. Rinse, repeat. I’ve learned that being organized and having things written down and having reminders helps to stay consistent. 

What helps me to do this is to always be running a 30 day challenge. I print out a habit tracker every month with a box for each action on each day to check off. I hold myself accountable by doing this with my partner and it has become a rivalry between us. We put conditions for the challenge where if one of us doesn’t check all the boxes in a day we have to do the punishment of the others choosing. For me if I don’t do my list I have to watch a marvel movie (which I hate) funny enough this has been a huge deterrent from me not completing my list. Not because the movie would be such a bad thing, but more out of stubbornness to not give my partner the satisfaction lol. One more thing to add I. This is to include things on your challenge that are obtainable and work yourself up each month. Discipline is like a muscle you have to work out to get continually stronger. You can’t go from being completely undisciplined one day to having completely disciplined the next. You have to work yourself up to it. Make sure to include things on the challenge like positive reinforcements before each task.

One of my items on my list is to create a “time box” for each day. This is a daily timed planner that outlines what I need to do for the day and at what time I need to accomplish it by. Keeps me organized and not save everything for the later part of the day so I don’t have to do everything at one time.

Finally give yourself some grace. It’s not easy to do these things, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Just remember that you are not alone, most people deal with the same things. Perspective is key, change the way you see things. Don’t say things like I have to go to work say I get to go to work, at least you have a job. Instead of saying I have to drive my busted up car say I get to drive my car, at least you have one, many people don’t. Chances are you are probably in a better spot than you think in comparison to how things could be. Be grateful for who you are and what you have. You could be sick and not able to do anything. I saw a video the other day that had someone asking if I offered to give you 10 million dollars would you take it. Everyone of course said yes. He then said okay I could give you this 10 million dollars, but you’ll only live for another week. Everyone then changed their mind. It stuck with me. I’m grateful to be healthy and though the money would be nice I’m happy to be healthy.","Thank you. I am trying one day at a time. The food thing is very hard as well as the phone. I’ve improved in some aspects, we pray 5x a day in our religion and I became a looot more consistent with that, I quit alcohol and drug phase from high school, more consistency with school, the medication helped me reduce my binge eating so I don’t feel as depressed and lost weight. 

I just feel like when some things are good, there are still a million things that are bad. Like sure I improved in these areas, but then I’m addressed with so much more responsibility and possibly getting married , and dealing with family and stress and I look around seeing an unorganized room when i know I have time to clean I’m just lazy.  Procrastinating important things. It scares me for the future especially for marriage. 

I appreciate your time to post this. I think food and screen time are my biggest weaknesses for now. Too much entertainment makes  the rest of life so dull. I will try to reduce carbs possibly try keto again and try to find other things to do aside from this stupid addictive phone."
t3_y3ddnb,[Need Advice] Tips on developing thicker skin for criticism?,"I’m an incredibly thin-skinned person when it comes to any sort of criticism. The second I hear any kind of criticism from a parent, professor, friend, or acquaintance, I feel incredibly deflated and my entire day is ruined. I think part of this comes from wanting to be liked by people and hating that people see something in me worth criticizing. But I want to change. Any advice on developing a more resilient attitude to criticism?","You need to grow your self confidence.

In my case. I studied some philosophy.

Also, you need to be smart to take this criticism like a good sign. Cuz if they have some critics about you, actually you need to think why are they doing this?

If you feel like you are doing things ok and you know who you are and have a clear goal and objectives that are aligned with your perspective of life, moral and ethics. 

Then there is a big chance that they only are making criticism about themselves. Cuz are ppl out there that doesn't have a little of confidence to achieve that you are achieving. Or actually envy your actual position or anything that you are doing. 

You need to be able to identify which critics actually are good for you. Be humble, and accept the critics that can be an improvement for you. Be smart, think about this critics like only information that comes to you. You decide to use it in the way you need. Don't waste good information but if the info comes with hate or trash words, just don't waste your time arguing or being mad, don't auto sabotage your mind.

In all of the cases that I mentioned critics are so good because if ppl are talking shit or want to demotivate you. It is sign that you are doing things ok. If they are good, the critics are constructive cuz they want you to be better. But in the other hand if they are bad, the critics are trash cuz they envy you and don't want you to success. 

But always listen, and take advantage of information.

Most of ppl actually don't want others to grow and have success in life cuz in that way they feel less bad.

Keep going.",Write down all the things you think are worth criticizing. Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective … that’s pretty much everything. Don’t take yourself so seriously.

But when the same human find himself in the front of other seductions where there are no apps to ""limit the use"" , then you will look at the core cause because at this poiny people usually get stcuk with self distructive behaviors

1. 12 years ago, I can't choose skirts for church meetings my parents wanted me to go to. I'd tell them I need a new skirt, and they'd get all pissed and shit while shopping for it. They attend a church that required girls to wear skirts so..... 

I got used to the idea of wearing the same 5 for 3 meetings a week. My mom started allowing me to get nice dresses/skirts etc after the older ladies at church bought me my first bible and some skirts.

But it came with a catch. I get to chose the skirt THEY prefer. In the end we'd buy the skirt I 'chose', but I'd rarely wear it, because I didn't choose it.

Obviously I got scolded because it was indeed a waste of money. I did wear them eventually cuz they were nice, I needed to develop more backbone. 

I get it that their sense of style is better, since I'd always later find their ideas to be pretty good,  but I'd like them to respect the choice they've given me. Moreover, I've caught them and my sister smirking about it. 

=======================

2. 7 years ago I needed a new laptop, so told my mom about it and we'd pay half-half. She was complaining about what kind of specs I want, how am I supposed to get it etc. I thought we were going to just ask our regular laptop guy for recommendations, as we've always done. So I took some time to search online and told her THE EXACT laptop I wanted, and the specs if I can't find the laptop. She got pissed again because 'there's no way she can find the laptop', even though I've told her I CAN GET IT MYSELF. 

In the end, she just bought a laptop based our regular guy's recommendation. It all turned out EXACTLY as I expected, and I just wasted my time researching about computer specs. I say 'researching' cuz my parents would complain about 'do you even know what X means?'

She herself had no idea what to do, and then she got angry at me about it. 

From then on, I'd ask my mom on what she expects. Or I'd be wasting my time like this again. If she dodges my question, I'd go on with my plan. I did that with my new phone.

=============

3. 3 years ago, I got a new phone cuz the old one got stolen. I needed it for work. For whatever reason, my mom thought I can go without. Yeah right, my boss and course mates are gonna contact me through fb messenger. She didnt like that I was going to get it via public transport. 

Why? 'It's not safe' 

I've explained a gazillion times HOW I'm going to get it, and its all routes and hours that I've frequented DAILY. NOTHING has happened to me on the train for nearly 2 years. 

On top of that, my dad complains about how we 'don't know how to use public transport to get around'  whatever that means.

I was pretty pissed that my mom wants X, my dad wants Y. Telling one side to please be considerate has never worked, so I'LL DECIDE FOR MYSELF. So I got my new phone the next day.

My dad asked me 'since when does our family use mirin?' maybe because it's my dad. When he says FREE CHOICE, he really means it. I just said 'now we do'. 

My mom wanted me to use beef instead of pork for my dish. When I asked why, she didn't answer. I'd need to make changes to the recipe if we're using beef, and honestly it'd be a waste of that beef. I also knew that if the dish tasted bad ON TOP OF not doing things my way, I'd be really pissed. So I said no, and gave my explanation. She was not happy with the answer. But I'm still gonna use pork instead. 

================

Call me inflexible but idk what else to do. No one has ever taught me how to fix my sensitiveness towards people who question my decisions. Now at 27, I still don't know how to fix it.",,
t3_13q8io6,[Need Advice] How do I manage my work and housework?,"
I am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it’s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. 
I just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .
Is it too much to ask ? Please help.
Also, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.","Cook in Batches like for 2/3 days. It saves a good chunck of time and you can use it for purposes. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.","Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it"
t3_qpvoke,[Need Advice] My shitty sleep schedule is making my depression worse! Tired but can't make myself sleep. Tried everything I could think of," My shitty sleep schedule is making my depression worse. The problem is that its a negative feedback loop. The later I stay up the less willpower I have to force myself to go to sleep.

I take Wellbutrin and it will keep me awake if I take it after like 9 am. The problem is that when I stay up till 2 am, and take it at 10 am I end up staying awake till 3 am the next night. Negative feedback loop!

I've tried all the things I can think of, that aren't just forcing myself to go to sleep because that's the one thing I can't do. I don't have insomnia, I can fall asleep fine as soon as I decide I want to. I get tired.The problem is that I never want to go to sleep. I hate my job and dread getting up and going to work in the morning. I don't want the freedom of ""after work"" to end.

I work from home and my hours are flexible, it's way too easy to stay up till 2 by justifying that my first meeting isn't till 10:30 the next day. But 2 turns into 4 and pretty soon I’m only getting 6 hours of sleep. 

I probably get around 6 - 7 hours of sleep a night. I know it doesn't sound terrible, but I know it is making my severe depression and fatigue even worse. Sometimes it feels like a form of self harm. I force myself to stay awake even when I’m not enjoying it. Even when I’m tired and feel sleepy. I don’t let myself go to sleep. 

I never really want to do anything but lay in bed on YouTube or Reddit and pretend that I don’t exist. I use my willpower to force myself to get out of bed and go to work, buy groceries, eat food, shower and go to the gym. I never look forward to anything, I even dread things I enjoy. Every minute of my life is a fight to push myself to continue. Every day I plan on going to sleep early, but by bedtime I’ve run out of willpower and just can’t make myself do it. 

I’ve done all the things that daytime me can to make nighttime me sleep:

* Red filters on all devices
* Blue light blocking glasses
* A sad light box to use in the mornings (haven’t really used it though, because I keep waking up with a light sensitive headache from sleep deprivation.)
* An analog alarm that is incredibly loud in the bathroom (I turned it off and went back to sleep)
* Sunrise alarm clock (Hurt my eyes and made headache worse)
* LED strips programmed to gradually turn on before wake up time
* Taking nighttime meds (one of which has sleepiness as a side effect) at 10 pm
* Taking melatonin, magnesium, GABA and L theanine (Makes me sleepy, but I just stay up anyway and feel like shit)
* Putting phone charger away from bed (I just ended up not charging my phone)
* Setting my phone to automatically shut down at 2 am (I just turn it on again)
* Having a nice bedtime routine with a cup of herbal tea
* Telling myself that if I get up early enough I’ll go buy a treat from a nearby coffee shop (I just didn’t get up anyway) 

Nighttime me is a clever bitch who can disable anything daytime me sets up to make myself sleep. The things on the list do make me tired, but I just stay awake anyway. I seem to have no consideration for my future self’s suffering so morning wake up calls do nothing. How do I fix this?","I say this with empathy, it sounds like this isn’t as much a problem with your sleep schedule as it is your mental health.

> I never really want to do anything but… pretend that I don’t exist

> I seem to have no consideration for my future self’s suffering

I understand you, because I’ve been there before, and I do hope it gets easier for you like it did for me. Try talking to a therapist? If you can’t, maybe talk to a few friends or family. Or journal things out by yourself, just to have a bit of mental clarity about what’s really affecting you right now. Bad sleep habits are often a symptom of the underlying issue, not the other way around. Please be kind to yourself.","Yea, I kinda had a feeling that the WFH situation was the biggest problem. I'm assuming you already realized this. I know you don't want to switch, but if your in the US there are a metric fuckton of job openings right now. I'd seriously consider it. If not, try to find a reason to go put and mingle, but with something productive and preferably a support group. I did language exchanges to learn Spanish and would use meetup.com and it made going out (which I hate, BTW) extremely fun. If you have a hobby, or maybe could make yourself get into one that has a group that does meetups I'd try that. Also, as for melatonin try .3 mg. I assume you have melatonin pills (I recommend getting the Natrol brand liquid dosed at 1mg and taking one dropper full which is .3mg, roughly) just about 1/15, basically a tiny nibble off the edge and try that. I used to have to take a double dose of Tylenol PM in addition to 5mg of melatonin just to fall asleep. I experienced major memory problems in my 20's until I researched and found the active ingredient in Tylenol PM could cause early onset dementia. Then I found research that showed .3mg of melatonin to be the best sleep aid. Now I can fall asleep at will, and have no issues not wanting to sleep, or fatigue and memory issues like before. Beyond that it sounds lime you know how to have proper sleep hygiene. I think if you can fix these two things you'll be good."
t3_yk8w5j,[need advice] I (30f) feel lost and don’t even know where to start changing my life,"I really don’t have any self worth or self esteem. A lot stems from me being a failure in life. I’m in my early 30s and only have a bachelors in art history. I have worked as an admin coordinator and don’t make much money. I definitely need a better job but don’t have skills or an education to get one. Other than that I don’t have any friends except for my boyfriend. Lately I signed up for a dance class so I hope I can make a friend there (I’m really shy and have a hard time reaching out). I need to rehaul my life because I’m not the person I want to be, but I just don’t know where to start.","It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure and self worth into what would be better described as a logic problem.   

If what you're doing isn't making you happy, then what might you do differently?  I know we're all creatures of habit, and it's hard to break a rut, especially if you need big changes, but stable homes get built brick by brick, and stable lives are built day by day.   

Try to find the least disagreeable change in the right direction you can tolerate and make it.   As yourself what your daily life would be if you were satisfied, and seek to mirror those actions until they become habit.","I hear ya, Life can be hard. I recently felt quite the same so i can relate to you. I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:

1. Assess my current situation
2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self
3. Create SMART goals 
4. Do a daily review of the day

**Assess the situation**.  
This is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  
I started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  
Infrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  
Then i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  
After that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.

This gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.

**Map out your ideal self**  
I basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.

&#x200B;

**SMART Goals**  
Way to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  
Relevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   


**Daily Review**  
The hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  


So these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life. Feel free to reach out if you wanna chat some more about it."
t3_w8hhhb,[Need Advice] Coping with severe phone addiction,"I've been working from home for a year - will start going to office twice a week from next month.
Since the beginning of the pandemic I started using my phone excessively.
The main addiction for me is mindlessly scrolling through social media. I'll start with Facebook, then go on to Instagram, then Reddit, linkedin and Twitter and then go down a youtube spiral and back to square one to do it all again.
Now I have multiple accounts on all these platforms and the amount of time I spend on my phone has gone up exponentially. Since last few months it has been hampering my work and productivity as well. I procrastinating and go on my phone and then end up not doing any work all day.

t3_14h6c47,"[Need advice] my brain is fried, I’ve avoided learning for years and it’s catching up to me at the age of 30","
Growing up, I didn’t have the motivation as a child. My parents were abusive in their own ways, and to each other. So I think that somewhat had a part in it. My mom got a divorce and that was super stressful on her with 4 kids to raise alone. So that’s 4 kids to constantly help with homework and there’s areas she didn’t remember or know about. No encouragement to join sports, etc. I know it was really hard for her and to keep up with 4 kids. She really tried her best. 

I lack knowledge in history, I know very few about our history. It never interested me. Throughout school, were given cheat sheets from our instructors to study from, based off our books. It was easy for us to pass the class. 

I was only really good at math in school, some of science, English, writing, etc. 

I want to be able to articulate what I’m saying. I can write it out but when I speak, it comes out all scrambled and it makes me even more anxious when I’m talking to someone. 

If a subject doesn’t interest me or I find it boring, it’s very hard for me to continue to learn/finish the assignment. 

To be honest, I don’t read. I used to love it as a child and collected books but idk what happened, I lost interest. I can’t find the motivation or interest to pick up a book. But I’ll read the news here and there, etc. that’s about it. 

I want to expand my vocabulary, be able to articulate, learn more about history (idk where to even begin).

I’m not even educated enough in politics, who most of our politicians are, etc. I never had much interest in it. I rarely keep up with the news (rarely watch tv anymore ever since I moved out of my mom’s house), I used to keep up with it with her. 

I also have a hard time learning, I think that may be due to me being partially deaf all my life. My ENT doctor refused hearing aids for me since I was a child. I recently met with a different audiologist 2 years ago and ask her about hearing aids and she said I’ve always qualified for it, she seemed really upset that I never received anything. She did mention that I’ve missed out on “so much learning,” from not having hearing aids. 

Sometimes it’s hard for me to comprehend what I’ve read, and to focus on it. So I’ll have to reread the whole thing again, or that sentence/paragraph, which frustrates me. I can’t sit and read for so long before I get distracted. 

I’ve also been going through very, very deep depression. With that, I’m even more disinterested and unmotivated.

I feel SO stupid and uneducated. When people talk to me about history, politics, anything that I lack knowledge in, I get so embarrassed and don’t know how to respond.","This sounds like ADHD. Check out the sub, do some research, and get an EVAL. After I was diagnosed and started getting medicated my anxiety, depression, malaise and inability to focus went away. I’m doing so much better at work, and and starting school soon. Just look into it. 

- Adult diagnosed person","Even as a child? I feel like I’ve been lazy all my life when it comes to learning

I’m a nurse. So all of the science courses were easy to me and since I was so interested in it (some subjects I forgot, because it was boring to me), I was able to sit down and study, watch videos, for hours and hours. 

When it came to writing APA papers, I was really good at writing them and got great scores. However, they were often late because the assignment required several pages, over subjects I had no interest in. I also can’t sit long and write a few papers in one sitting because I get distracted easily, or I get frustrated easily. 

I feel lazy and so stupid/ignorant, because I lack critical information that EVERYONE should know about (history, politics, etc.) Even what seems basic vocabulary to everyone else, I may lack in. I want to be able to use bigger words and know how to use them.

I feel SO behind and thinking about all of this makes me anxious af every single day"

t3_y27zmv,[Need Advice] How to escape from escapism?,">TLDR:  How do I escape from escapism?

The title says it all. I find myself escaping from my problems, and indulge myself in other (less important) activities that wastes my time. I understand it won't help me or be productive in anyway but i can't help it. 
After a lot of contemplating I figured it's just me trying to escape from everything that's even mildly unpleasant. It is stagnating my growth and I'm just sick of it.

So I've come here asking for your help","I'd suggest to try breaking down the 'complex' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)

For example: 

1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you're trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your 'excuse' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. 

The goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being 'complex' or 'scary'. You just see all things you did 'wrong' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren't that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be 'beaten' / fixed.

Besides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to 'stop escaping' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don't need it. Let's cross-check it altogether, let's not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you'd like to stop escaping in first place.

**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let's imagine (for example) it's social media. 

Fine - for the list of things you 'escaped', out of 10 things - let's imagine that 5 were 'escaped' due to social media distraction. If it's true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it's something else - doesn't matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).

**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before). Getting back to this same file will help you a lot, because it'll be your ""center for fighting escapism"" in some way. And a place where your next decisions/healthy habits might be started from.","escaping escapism? sounds like getting out a nail with another nail. 
Face your problems head on. It’s the only way. The only way out, is through. I know it sucks, sounds painful, and we want to avoid it, thus our dilemma.

t3_u7gixv,[need advice] can’t stop unproductive habits that I don’t even enjoy anymore,"Hello friends

I’ve not looked or posted on here for a long time in fact I don’t think I ever really gave this sub a fair shot. So here I am.

Part of my problem is I didn’t have many good role models growing up so I didn’t really do my homework at school and I was also a social outcast, got bullied a lot, isolated myself to protect myself from feeling pain and trauma from people. I can speak with people, give customer service, but in terms of going where there are people in my free time that’s something I’m resistant to doing and it’s been a problem for years. I’ve not had the best luck I went to a boxing gym years ago and didn’t work out. Went to a meditation group, few weeks later covid happene. Present day I’m no longer convinced I want any part of it after so long. I find it very hard to enjoy most peoples company and I’m not sure they enjoy mine either as my interests are few and a bit odd which makes me doubt it’s worth even trying anymore. 

So now what I had intended to write. I’ve been struggling it’s porn for a good few years, as in when I I use it I feel shit afterwards and the effect lasts for a few days. When I don’t use it for a few weeks or more I feel strong pressure to go back to it which I can’t handle long term. I play computer games and scroll through YouTube and most of time it makes me feel crap and I don’t enjoy it yet I continue with it because doing something that requires attention and learning seems to much effort like it is painful. Today I walked for a good few hours, I practice hrv breathing in the mornings, I meditated for an hour in total I’m guessing today and yet I still end up back on YouTube or playing video games then feeling crap afterward. I read some of a book today also, but it wasn’t an enjoyable experience this time so it put me off reading later in the day or the evening. So does anyone have advice for me mainly about how to stop doing unproductive habits you don’t enjoy doing anymore and a good way to think about trying something that requires more effort than one is use to giving?",,

To me this sounds like you've been very hard on yourself for a long time. Maybe early caretakers were hard on you and you learned it from them? Be kind to yourself, and give yourself a hug. Life is hard, and you have a lot on your plate (kids add so much to your daily tasks). You don't owe the world progress or perfection. But you owe yourself kindness. 

Something that helped me a great deal is this book: Taming Your Outer Child by Susan Anderson. It sounds hokey, and the exercises often feel stupid. I don't really buy into all the ideas in that book, but the exercises are compassionate and practical and give you an achievable path forward with an emphasis on building yourself up with kindness. Following the exercises in that book helped me go from bouncing around part-time work, to finally getting my very first full time job at 30. It's not overnight, and it's not linear. I really suggest sticking with it for at least 3 months.

One exercise I think is appropriate for all ages and you can do with your kids! The ""future you"" exercise can be really fun. Draw the you you want to be 5 years from now, you draw them or write them in as much detail as possible. Then, you write down something (one thing) you can accomplish today to bring yourself a little closer to that person. It can be ""go for a walk"" or ""draw for 5 minutes"" or ""write a list"". If you're feeling froggy it can be bigger, but it should be something you can accomplish easily today. Tomorrow (or next month, like it was for me) you can join that art class at the Y, or join a walking group, but today keep it simple. Do another thing tomorrow. 

Finally, please be kind to yourself. Living for your kids is admirable, but you have to live a bit for yourself, too. I'm sure you're children don't see you the way you're saying.

Of course, my sleep has been almost non-existant, I've stopped going to therapy, I've been drinking (well 7 days clean again but I'm an alcoholic and have recently relapsed and gone back on the wagon) I'm not exercising. I know a large portion of this can be attributed to the fact I lost my mother suddenly 2 months ago, it was a short, unexpected and devasting illness. But to be honest I was feeling very stuck before everything happened with mum and its just worse now, i can't blame everything on that. I'm just stuck in every aspect of my life.

I'm begging for some kind of release/get out of jail free card which I know is impossible. I know nothing anyone can say will be the magic words to fix me or fix the avoidance of work but I just don't know what else I can possibly do apart from walk into traffic to feel better. I'm not actually going to do that, I feel like I'm a failure at that as well but this is how desperate I feel right now.",,
t3_w90lop,[Need Advice] I feel terrible over not being productive,"Ever since I (17F) began quarantine in 2020, I have been stuck in this cycle where I just do nothing all day. I just wake up, stay on my phone & do nothing, and then sleep very late at night. 

 And now that summer is almost over, and school is about to begin, all I can only look back now and realized how much time I've wasted...all this free time, and I've accomplished ***nothing***. All it does is just make feel like a giant piece of shit. Here I am sitting on my ass doing nothing, wasting whatever time I could be doing something else...on my fucking phone.  

Every time I do try to set up some goals, and try doing better, for some reason, I just never start. I never actually implement the goals & start doing it. 

Now that college is on the horizon, I feel like it's all over. I feel like I'll never have the free time ever again...

I feel like garbage, I feel guilty for ***wasting*** so much time doing nothing. I literally have nothing to show for my summer except staying inside my house doing nothing. 

I don't know what to do, I just want this to stop. I want to be able to enjoy the things I once did. I want to feel like I actually *want* to complete my goals, rather it be something that keeps me off of youtube & tiktok. I tried blocking apps, I've tried deleting them, but I always just regress back, and I hate myself for it. I have a shitty diet, a shitty sleep schedule, and spend my days doing shit. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong at all or where to even start when trying to stop this. Just any help would be appreciated.","If you don’t forgive yourself for wasting time in the past, all you’ll do is feel shitty about yourself, when you feel shitty about yourself you don’t feel motivated to achieve your goals because you believe you’ll fail before you try.

You cannot change what you did before, only what you’re able to do now. Stop feeling guilty about wasting time, you’re 17 you have a lot of time ahead of you.",
t3_te33ym,"[Need advice] I’m married, late-20s, and am constantly hoping to escape life.","It always boils back to my job too. I am always trying to escape the responsibilities at my job. I’ve never wanted this job, it’s overwhelming with the responsibilities and I feel I can’t manage my time or projects adequately. I have such a hard time focusing and always feel every task is the world collapsing if I don’t get it right or know everything on the spot. It feels like everyone has huge expectations of me and I feel that I cannot fulfill them.

Project management is not my calling and I always want to just be working with my hands or doing something more trade related, but I  fear the decrease in pay. 
I tell myself often that this is a good opportunity that I should hold onto but I just can’t seem to manage it properly and am constantly wishing i could quit and have quite a few thoughts of suicide specifically due to the job… I just lose interest in everything and I like to blame it on this job. There are hobbies that I’m interested in but always feel that my time should be used differently. There’s this feeling that I’m never in the right place or always doing the wrong thing in that moment. 

I’m afraid also that this mind set wouldn’t change if I found another job. That I would just carry it with me for some reason.

Feeling very lost, stressed, and hoping to escape this reality but fear the shame of being a quitter and the pain it would cause my wife.

I need help, but I’m not sure I would truly utilize the help I receive. Who do I go to?",,
t3_uh7wy2,[Need Advice] No Work Ethic,"I have zero work ethic, I Google and research for answers and no matter what I do, I find myself every week with terrible ethic, I’m 17 year old Male but I’m homeschooled and soon to be in college, I pay my own car insurance and things of the sort. Every week I find myself making excuses to get out of work, to stay home, I’ve been through 3 jobs but am always trying to get out of work in them. I only work 3 days a week at 6 hours a day, I just never feel like going and always find excuses. I got my paycheck last Friday and now it’s Monday and I’ve already blown through it, my paychecks are half as big as they should be due to always skipping, how can I get better work ethic and drive, and a will to go to work and to enjoy it? I don’t want to be lazy. Every time I try to start good habits they last about 3 days and they end there.",,
t3_t7z46c,[Need Advice] Changing at 30,"Hey all. I hope you’re well today. I’m just looking for motivation and possibly some examples of people who have made drastic changes themselves for the better in their late 20s/30s.

Im 29, I’m in a lot of debt, my addictive habits and insecurities have lead me to lose 5 friends within the span of a year/ made me a bit of a recluse and my current career path is stagnant.
Those are the negatives.

The positives are that I have a workout routine that I am slowly improving upon, my current jobs give me a lot of free time which gives me time to look for new career paths/opportunities to go into. Also my family has a history of mental disorders so for the first time, I’m trying out antidepressants. They’re helping me keep a cool head but I see that they’re not going to change your habits.

I realized too that I have no sense of personal boundaries or sense boundaries for others which has deeply affected my personal relationships.

Is there anyone who has made changes in their life at that age? I understand it’s possible but I would just like to hear from someone.",,
t3_p7oimu,[need advice] how to stop comfort eating?,"hi, sorry for poor formatting as I’m currently on mobile and in a state of distress. im also not 100% sure this is the subreddit for this, but im giving it a shot

im 17 years old and i am obese. i have been almost my entire life. growing up, my father was incredibly abusive, and i would see my mother turn to food for comfort. chips, soda, pizza, takeout, you name it. 

eventually my mother worked up the courage to leave, but the habits remained. and i piggybacked off of them. this would be at approximately 13 years old when he left, and i was nearing 245 pounds (i am a taller girl, currently 6’1) and i was constantly bullied as well for my size, which fueled my poor habits. my mother didnt know how to comfort me, so when i would come home crying, she enabled me by taking me out for ice cream to comfort me. i know she meant well, but its a habit i cant break. 

with the pandemic, ive gained a SHITLOAD of weight. there are stressors as well contributing to that. my grandmother is battling cancer, my stepdad lost his job, and i find with my license ive recently acquired, i can easily go to shops and pick something up that i dont need. i want to change. i want to be healthy, i dont want to be fat my entire life. i want to enjoy my life without heaving after a flight of stairs. 

but i dont know how. so this is my last resort at this point. my mother is no help, god bless her. i am begging for some sort of advice or personal experiences relating to mine in some way.

i apologize if this is long winded. i am incredibly desperate, and wanted to add some backstory to get the situation clear.",,
t3_10hhpmg,[Need advice] How do you do it for yourself?,"“It” can be a lot of things for example: how do you workout for yourself? For a true desire to be healthy for YOURSELF, not because you want to look good for so-and-so, not because you want to look a certain way so others won’t see you as unhealthy or overweight, not for anyone. Only your own health and personal gains. 

I feel like I’ve always done things for praise from others or to look good to others. Won a trophy? Lots of congratulations from peers. Look skinny? People will be attracted to you and you will be more likely to be accepted. Get an A+ on a paper? Parents will say good job. 

I have only done things for the reactions of people not for me. I think what I’m asking is how do you get the internal drive to want to do things for yourself and your own personal gain.","One important aspect is that you need to think long and hard about what your own core values are - what do you think is truly important, in and of itself? Withou

Everyone has a different set of things that really speak to them on a gut level. It might be ""a dedicated work ethic,"" or ""being a dependable friend,"" or ""educating yourself,"" or ""going outside my comfort zone,"" or ""showing kindness,"" or any number of things. There's no right or wrong answer - but there are certain things that speak to you on a deep, foundational level.

When you consciously decide to engage in behaviors that are in alignment with your own core values, then you will increase the likelihood of intrinsic motivation - because you will respect the implicit value of your own efforts.",
