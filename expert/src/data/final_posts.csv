t3_uu5woe,"[Need Advice] I’m a 29-year-old male that has wasted 16 years of my life in video games, escapism, alcohol, and marijuana use, and feel so behind, I don’t know where to start.","I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?","PARAGRAPHS OP PARAGRAPHS

Honestly though you’re probably better off than you think if you see the problems. Most people aren’t very self aware. Just put one foot in front of the other and don’t give up even when you have the inevitable setback or relapse.","Video games can be harmful to professional development, yes. But it is also an emotional and social outlet. Not everyone needs to cut it entirely but I agree with the sentiment. Can be harmful and overused, like social media or the internet in general","Hey there! First off, congrats on the weight loss—that's a huge achievement and shows you have the ability to make significant changes. It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:

1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.

3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.

4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.

5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.

6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.

Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!","First off, congrats on the 100lb weight loss - that's a massive achievement that shows you're capable of significant change when you put your mind to it. Don't downplay it, even if the method wasn't perfect. You've already proven you can transform yourself.

The gaming and escapism make total sense given your background. But now you're ready to level up in the real world, and that's going to take breaking things down into smaller, manageable quests rather than trying to solve everything at once.

Start with creating a basic daily structure. Pick 3-4 fixed times each day for essential activities like waking up, eating meals, and going to bed. Stick to these times religiously for 2-3 weeks until they become automatic. This will help ground you in the present moment and give your days some scaffolding to build on.

For career direction, instead of trying to find your passion immediately, focus on building general workplace skills through any steady job. The goal right now isn't finding your dream career - it's developing consistency, responsibility, and basic professional capabilities. These transfer to any field you eventually choose.

To improve focus and presence, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes and do just ONE thing during that time. Could be reading, cleaning, job searching, whatever. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back to the task. Start with 20 minutes once per day, then gradually increase. This builds your ""attention muscle"" over time.

You're not as far behind as you think. Many people reset their lives in their 30s and 40s. The key is to stop comparing yourself to others and focus on taking small, consistent steps forward. You've already shown you can make major changes - now it's about applying that same determination to building the life you want, one day at a time.","It takes a lot of courage to share your story and acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve. First, let's give you credit for recognizing your patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. It's also great that you've made progress in some areas, like losing 100lbs, which shows you're capable of achieving your goals when you set your mind to it.

To start building discipline and structure, I'd recommend starting small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, focus on creating a daily routine that includes time blocks for self-care, learning, and productivity. You can begin by setting aside 30 minutes each morning for journaling or meditation to help clear your mind and set intentions for the day.

Since you mentioned struggling with scatter-brained thoughts and memory recall, consider using a planner or app to stay organized and keep track of your tasks and goals. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks can also help you build momentum and confidence.

To become more present and aware of your surroundings, try incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as taking short walks or doing a few minutes of deep breathing exercises. You can also practice active listening by focusing on the person speaking to you, maintaining eye contact, and asking open-ended questions to encourage meaningful conversations.

Remember that personal growth is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - celebrate your small wins, and use them as motivation to keep moving forward. You've got this, and it's never too late to make a positive change in your life.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're even writing this post shows you're ready to make a change, and that's huge. You've already lost 100lbs, even if you feel conflicted about how you did it, that's still a massive accomplishment. Give yourself some credit for that!

It's easy to get overwhelmed when you feel behind, so let's break it down. Forget about comparing yourself to your friends. Everyone's on their own timeline. Focus on small, consistent steps.

Since you're struggling with structure, start with ONE thing. Maybe it's waking up at the same time every day, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill on Khan Academy. Just one thing, and build from there. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight.

About the memory issues and losing perspective, try journaling. Write down those insights as soon as you have them. Even just a few sentences can help you remember and revisit those ideas later.

To be more present, try mindfulness exercises. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through short meditations. Even just 5 minutes a day can make a difference. When you find your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath or your surroundings.

As for finding a career path, don't put so much pressure on yourself to find the ""perfect"" thing right away. Experiment! Try volunteering, taking online courses, or shadowing someone in a field you're curious about. The goal is to explore and learn, not to find the ultimate answer immediately.

You've got this. It's a journey, not a race. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward.

t3_v5rvvy,[Need Advice] What do you do when you can't fall asleep but have to wake up early?,"Here I am, after 4 hours of trying to sleep when my body said no. It's almost 4AM and I have to wake up at 7AM in 3 hours. I don't know what to do. How to fall asleep. Why. What should I do??","My time to shine. Insomnia since age 9, been on prescription sleeping meds that mostly do the trick now. But, for short term solutions or when my meds aren’t kicking in:
The podcast “sleep with me” is great, literally bores you to sleep with mindless rambling. Or, the podcast “stuff you should know”, and pick a boring topic. And I’d echo the first comment about elevating your legs, even a pillow under the knees. Sometimes when I can’t sleep I try to sleep on the couch, are you able to change your scenery? Sometimes even the floor with pillows is weirdly enough to reset my brain. Another trick I use is to close your eyes and start planning something very far in the future that is non-consequential. Like your wedding day or exactly how you’d lay out a castle if you lived in it. Or, get out of bed and start reading a dry book, realize how tired you are, and get back in bed lol. Follow along to a 5 minute deep breathing video on the floor. An app I like that is very calming is called Monument- a simple puzzle game that has lovely music and colors. Lastly, everybody is human and sometimes rescheduling your morning event is the best thing- people will probably understand. Have some tools in your pocket next time it happens!

Edit: monument valley* is the app",Oh my god... his ww1 mustard gas segment scarred me. I would not want to dream listening to that,"Hey there! Sorry to hear you're having trouble sleeping. It can be really frustrating when you know you need rest but just can't seem to get there. Here are a few things you might try:

1. **Get out of bed for a bit**: Sometimes, just lying there can make it worse. Try getting up and doing something relaxing, like reading a book or listening to calming music, for about 15-20 minutes before trying again.

2. **Limit screen time**: If you haven't already, put away your phone or any screens. The blue light can mess with your sleep cycle.

3. **Breathing exercises**: Focus on deep, slow breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This can help calm your mind and body.

4. **Stay cool and dark**: Make sure your room is cool and dark, which can help signal to your body that it's time to sleep.

5. **Don't stress about it**: Easier said than done, but try not to stress about not sleeping. Sometimes just accepting that you might not get a full night's sleep can help you relax enough to drift off.

For the future, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help train your body to know when it's time to wind down. Good luck, and I hope you catch some Z's soon!","Been there - those nights are rough. At this point, trying to force sleep will likely just stress you out more. Since you have 3 hours until wake-up time, your best bet is to accept tonight as a reduced sleep night and focus on getting through tomorrow while setting yourself up better for the next night.

For right now: Get up and do something calm and low-key for 20-30 minutes (read a book, light stretching, etc) - no screens. Then try lying down again. If sleep comes, great. If not, at least rest your body even if your mind is awake.

For tomorrow: Stick to your normal wake time no matter what. It'll be tough but pushing through will help reset your sleep schedule. During the day, get some sunlight early, maybe take a short walk. No caffeine after lunch. If you absolutely need to, a 20-minute power nap before 3PM can help, but don't sleep longer or it'll mess up tomorrow night.

For better sleep going forward: Set a consistent bedtime routine that starts 30-60 minutes before bed. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Regular exercise (but not right before bed) can really help too. If racing thoughts keep you up, try writing them down before bed to get them out of your head.

The key is not to spiral about one bad night - it happens to everyone. Focus on building good sleep habits over time rather than forcing it in the moment.","When you're lying awake and can't seem to fall asleep, it can be really frustrating, especially with an early wake-up call looming. One thing that might help is trying to relax your body and mind - sometimes our brains can get stuck in overdrive when we're stressed about not sleeping. You could try some gentle stretches, deep breathing exercises, or even just focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. If your mind starts racing, acknowledge the thoughts but gently let them go without engaging with them. It might also be helpful to avoid screens for a bit, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep. Since you've only got a few hours left before your alarm goes off, you could also try setting a timer for 20-30 minutes and telling yourself you'll just rest during that time - sometimes taking the pressure off of actually falling asleep can help your body relax enough to drift off. Not ideal, I know, but hopefully something in there helps you catch a bit of sleep before your wake-up time.","Okay, that sucks. Been there. Honestly, with only 3 hours left, trying to force sleep might just stress you out more. Here's what I'd do *right now*:

First, get out of bed. Don't associate your bed with being awake and frustrated. Go to another room, dim the lights, and do something *really* boring and relaxing. Think: reading a physical book (not a screen!), gentle stretching, or listening to a sleep story. No phone, no bright lights, no mentally stimulating activities.

Second, when you start feeling even a little bit sleepy again, head back to bed.

For the long term, this sounds like a sleep schedule issue. Start thinking about a consistent bedtime routine. Things like cutting caffeine after noon, making your bedroom dark and cool, and winding down with a relaxing activity an hour before bed can make a huge difference. Maybe even try a sleep app to track your sleep and see if you can identify any patterns. Good luck!

t3_p07p49,[Need Advice] How to stop worrying about whether I am intelligent enough to pursue something and just do it?,"I’ve been struggling with this for a while now. I’m reaching the stage in my life where I am figuring out what I will be doing with my life, but I struggle to commit to things because I am constantly worried that if I fail, I will have to admit that I am not smart enough.

I want to be able to learn all the things that interest me, but I constantly doubt myself and feel like I may not be good enough. This has led me to limit myself and doubt every decision I make.  I know it’s an immature and damaging mindset to have but I haven’t been able to get rid of it because I am worried that I’ll feel like I wasted my life if I don’t prove to myself that I can excel at what I put my mind to. 

Edit: To add onto this a little more, I feel like I am constantly trying to prove to myself that I am intelligent, self aware etc, but then when I can’t do something or figure something out right away, I use it as a way to put myself down and say to myself, “see, you can’t be successful or knowledgeable because you couldn’t do this thing that other people can do easily” 

All advice is appreciated.

Edit: Id like to thank everyone for their comments and advice. There’s been a lot of helpful advice that I hope I can use to change my mindset and better myself",The best advice I've ever been given is that somebody stupider than you is doing what you wish you were doing.,"This is so simple but it helps me so much. 

Stop every thought, movement and word coming from your mouth. Essentially freeze.

When you’re ready, say this out loud. 3……. 2………. 1………… GO!

If it’s really hard start from 5. But silence absolutely everything. The thing you need to do the most will still be at the front of your mind. When you say go, and make the first gesture to move, your body starts doing the most important task on your list. Trust yourself.","It's totally normal to have doubts about your abilities, but remember that intelligence isn't fixed—it's something you can develop over time. Instead of focusing on whether you're ""smart enough,"" try shifting your mindset to one of growth. Start by setting small, achievable goals in the areas you're interested in. This way, you can build confidence through incremental successes. Also, remember that failure is a part of learning. Everyone struggles at some point, and it's those struggles that often lead to the most growth. Try to view challenges as opportunities to learn rather than as reflections of your worth. Lastly, surround yourself with supportive people who encourage your growth and remind you of your progress. You've got this!","Your mindset about intelligence is actually holding you back more than any real limitations would. Intelligence isn't fixed - it grows through effort and practice, just like building muscle. Every time you struggle with something new, you're literally making your brain stronger and more capable.

Instead of viewing struggle as proof you're not smart enough, try reframing it as proof you're learning. Nobody is born knowing complex things. Even genius physicists had to learn basic addition first. The people you think are doing things ""easily"" have usually just put in hours of practice you didn't see.

Here's what helped me break this cycle: Start with small challenges where failure has low stakes. Pick up a new hobby or skill that interests you, but isn't tied to your career or identity. When you mess up (which you will), notice that the world doesn't end. Keep a log of your progress to see how you improve over time.

The truth is, success comes more from persistence than natural talent. Being willing to be bad at something temporarily is actually a sign of intelligence - it means you understand that mastery takes time. Smart people aren't people who ""just get it"" immediately, they're people who keep going even when it's difficult.

Stop trying to prove your intelligence and start proving your dedication instead. Intelligence without action accomplishes nothing. Action, even with average intelligence, can accomplish amazing things. Pick something that excites you and commit to showing up for it consistently, regardless of how smart you feel on any given day.","It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and fear of not meeting your own expectations. One thing that might help is to focus on the process of learning and improvement, rather than the end result. Instead of worrying about whether you're ""intelligent enough"" to pursue something, try to reframe your thinking around what you can learn and accomplish with dedication and hard work. Remember that intelligence and ability are not fixed traits, but rather things that can be developed over time with practice and effort.

It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate your successes along the way. This can help build confidence and reinforce the idea that you're capable of learning and growing. Additionally, try to practice self-compassion when you encounter obstacles or setbacks - instead of using them as evidence of your supposed lack of intelligence, remind yourself that everyone faces challenges and that it's okay to make mistakes.

Lastly, consider the idea that ""good enough"" is, well, good enough. You don't have to be perfect or excel at everything you try in order to be worthy or successful. By letting go of some of that pressure and expectation, you might find that you're more free to explore your interests and pursue your passions without getting bogged down in self-doubt.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That fear of not being ""smart enough"" can be a real motivation killer. It sounds like you're stuck in a perfectionist trap, where anything less than immediate success feels like proof of inadequacy.

Here's a thought: reframe ""failure"" as learning. Seriously. Every time you stumble, instead of beating yourself up, ask ""Okay, what did I learn from this?"" Even the most brilliant people fail all the time; the difference is they use those failures to get better.

Also, try breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of thinking ""I need to master X,"" think ""I'm going to spend 30 minutes learning the basics of X today."" Small wins build momentum and confidence.

Finally, be kinder to yourself. You're not going to be an expert overnight. Give yourself permission to be a beginner, to make mistakes, and to learn along the way. Focus on the process of learning and growth, not just the end result. You got this!

t3_vyhoxf,[Need advice] I'm a 26 year old failure and I don't know what to do anymore.,"I'm 26 years old and I am a failure who is completely useless to society. What should I do?

I'm a stereotype loser. I'm 26. I still live with my parents. I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. 

It's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. 

I have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. 

How can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.

Edit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted. There are a lot of people who posted really thoughtful things and I appreciate that.","26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.

Life is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.

Figure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be ""to travel the world"" or ""to buy a house"" or ""get married and raise a family"" or as simple as ""get a job that lets you live comfortably"". Figure out what it is.

Consistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.

Break down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. 

The secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.

And if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer. If I was in your position, I would start there.",It's hard to do something you like when you don't even know what you like 😔,"Hey there, first off, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It sounds incredibly tough, but I want to remind you that you're not alone in this. Many people have felt stuck and found a way forward, and you can too. 

Let's start small. It might help to focus on building a routine that gives you a sense of control and accomplishment. Start with something simple, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a new hobby or skill. It doesn't have to be perfect or big, just something that you can stick to and gradually build on.

Consider exploring interests outside of your current job. There are tons of free resources online to learn new skills, whether it's coding, graphic design, or even something like cooking. This could open up new opportunities and help you discover what you enjoy.

Also, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a game-changer. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation. It's great that you're already on medication, but therapy can offer additional tools to help manage those tough thoughts.

Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate the little wins and be kind to yourself along the way. You've taken a big step by reaching out here, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and take it one day at a time. You've got this.","First off - you're not a failure. You're someone going through a really tough time, but you're here asking for help, which shows you want to make changes. That takes courage.

Let's break this down into manageable pieces. Your mental health needs to be the priority right now. Those thoughts you're having are serious, and while medication helps keep you above water, you might benefit from working with a therapist who can give you additional tools to manage those thoughts. Many offer sliding scale payments if cost is a concern.

For the career situation - journalism skills are actually pretty versatile. Writing, research, communication, and critical thinking are valuable in many fields. Have you considered content marketing, technical writing, or corporate communications? These often pay better than traditional journalism and have more job openings. Your degree isn't useless - it just might need to be applied differently than you originally planned.

Start small with building discipline. Pick one tiny goal for tomorrow - maybe it's applying to one job, taking a 10-minute walk, or writing for 15 minutes. Something achievable. Then do it again the next day. Small wins build momentum.

The debt feels overwhelming now, but it's manageable with the right approach. Look into income-based repayment plans if you haven't already. They can make monthly payments more reasonable while you work on increasing your income.

You're 26 - you have time to reshape your path. Many successful people didn't figure things out until their 30s or later. Focus on taking one small step forward each day. That's how real change happens.

If you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to crisis resources. You matter, and there are people who want to help.","It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles like this, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. First, let's acknowledge that you're not a failure - you're 26, and many people take time to figure out their path in life. It's okay to not have it all together yet. 

It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, and that's understandable given your situation. One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try focusing on what you can do today or this week to move forward. This could be as simple as updating your resume, applying to a few jobs, or reaching out to someone in a field that interests you.

Regarding your mental health, it's great that you're already taking steps to manage your symptoms with medication. Have you considered talking to a therapist who can help you work through some of these feelings and develop coping strategies? Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. 

In terms of turning your life around, it might be helpful to explore different areas that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your degree. You could try volunteering, taking online courses, or attending workshops to learn new skills and meet people in different fields. This can help you build confidence and find things that you enjoy, which can be a great motivator.

Lastly, please don't give up on yourself. You've already taken the first step by reaching out for help, and that takes a lot of courage. There are people who care about you and want to support you, and there are resources available to help you get back on your feet. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like things are tough - you got this.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's easy to feel overwhelmed, but turning things around is totally possible, even if it seems impossible right now.

First, about the mental health stuff: it's great you're on antidepressants, but if they're just keeping you ""above water,"" it might be worth talking to your doctor about adjusting the dosage or trying something different. Finding the right medication can make a massive difference. Also, have you considered therapy? Talking to someone might help you process those thoughts and develop coping mechanisms.

As for the rest, let's break it down. You feel stuck with your job and degree. Okay, journalism might not be the golden ticket right now, but it taught you skills – writing, research, communication. Those are valuable! Think about how you can leverage them. Maybe content writing, social media management, or even technical writing. Look for online courses or certifications in those areas – many are free or low-cost.

Regarding the ""failure"" label, ditch it. You're 26. That's young! Plenty of people change careers, learn new skills, and find their passion later in life. It's not a race. Start small. Pick one thing you want to improve – maybe it's learning a new skill, maybe it's exercising more, maybe it's just reading a book a week. Focus on that one thing and build momentum.

Living with your parents isn't ideal, but it's a reality for many people these days. Use this time to your advantage. Save money, learn new skills, and plan your next move. Don't beat yourself up about it.

Finally, about having ""zero interest"": that's probably not true. Everyone is interested in something. Think back to what you enjoyed as a kid, or what topics you find yourself reading about online. Explore those interests! Join a club, take a class, volunteer. You might discover a hidden passion.

The key is to start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. You've got this.

t3_oexyx3,[need advice] how do you force yourself to wake up early without feeling miserable,"I’ve always been a night owl for as long as I can remember. I love staying awake at night, and I naturally tend to fall asleep around 2 to 3 AM and wake up around 10-11AM feeling well-rested. But lately I’ve really had a desire to try to become a morning person so that I can be more productive throughout the day. Do you guys have any tips on how you wake up early, like 6 AM? How do you force yourself out of bed when all you feel like doing is sleeping for “five more minutes.”

Edit: just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to contribute such helpful comments! I may not be able to comment on each individual post, but I will try to read as many tips as I can and incorporate them. I hope others find these tips just as helpful as I did :)","I’m the same as you. I used to spend the whole night scrolling the internet, binge watching, buying useless stuff, whatever. Waking up at 1pm easily. Over the past year I’ve decided to get my life in order. Didn’t especially focus on my sleep schedule issues, but on my general well being. I listen to my body more, I rest more and quit drinking, I take the time to do painting / drawing, whatever creative activity calms me down. Cut out all social media except for Reddit sometimes, never at night. I started feeling more relaxed in the evenings, and I came to enjoy reading a book at 10pm as much as I used to enjoy binge watching Netflix all night. Being far from screens, I get tired, I fall asleep. Naturally, I wake up earlier and earlier every week, step by step. 

My point is, I’ve used every technic I could find to become a morning person before, and it never worked (I was late EVERY day to my job for 4 years). It is only when I started taking care of myself globally and on a more spiritual level too that it has changed. Feeling good and proud about yourself is the best way to actually want to get out of bed and face the day.","* A normal sleep schedule
* An accountability partner getting me to follow said schedule, who also is my partner
* A happier partner
* More time do to the fun stuff with said partner
* Nice breakfasts together
* Two squabbles less
* Also what the others said","Hey there! Transitioning from a night owl to an early riser can be challenging, but it's definitely doable with some gradual changes. Start by adjusting your bedtime in small increments, like 15-30 minutes earlier each night, until you reach your desired wake-up time. Consistency is key, so try to stick to the same sleep schedule even on weekends. 

Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, meditating, or taking a warm shower. In the morning, place your alarm clock across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. Once you're up, expose yourself to natural light as soon as possible to help reset your internal clock.

Lastly, give yourself something to look forward to in the morning, like a delicious breakfast or a few minutes of quiet time with a cup of coffee. It might take some time, but with patience and persistence, you'll likely find it easier to wake up early and start your day on a productive note. Good luck!","The key to becoming an early riser isn't about forcing yourself - it's about gradually shifting your sleep schedule and creating the right conditions. Since you naturally fall asleep at 2-3 AM, try moving your bedtime earlier by 15-20 minutes every few days. This gradual approach is much more sustainable than trying to suddenly jump to an early schedule.

Make your morning routine something to look forward to. Maybe it's a really good coffee, a peaceful breakfast, or some activity you enjoy. Having a compelling reason to get up makes a huge difference.

For the actual wake-up part: Put your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. Once you're up, immediately open your curtains or step outside - natural light helps reset your circadian rhythm. The first 5 minutes are the hardest, but if you can push through those, it gets much easier.

Most importantly, be consistent with your sleep schedule, even on weekends. Your body craves routine. If you stick to roughly the same sleep and wake times, your internal clock will eventually adjust and waking up early will feel more natural.

Remember that feeling groggy when you first wake up is normal for everyone - it's called sleep inertia and typically lasts 15-30 minutes. Power through it, and you'll feel more alert soon enough.","One strategy that might help is to start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually working your way up to your desired wake-up time of 6 AM. This can make the transition less jarring and allow your body to adjust. Additionally, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can signal to your brain that it's time to sleep, making it easier to wake up in the morning. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, and opt for relaxing activities like reading or meditation instead. When your alarm goes off, get out of bed immediately and expose yourself to some natural light - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make you feel more alert. It might also be helpful to have a reason to get out of bed, whether that's a morning workout, a quiet moment of reflection, or a cup of coffee, so find something that motivates you to start your day on a positive note. Remember, it may take some time for your body to adjust, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.","Hey! I totally get the night owl struggle. Shifting your sleep schedule is tough, but definitely doable. Here's what's worked for me and others I know:

First, don't try to jump straight to 6 AM. That's a recipe for misery. Instead, shift your wake-up time by 15-30 minutes *earlier* each day. This gradual approach lets your body adjust.

Second, create a compelling reason to get out of bed. ""Being more productive"" is a good goal, but what *specific* activity will you do at 6 AM that you're actually excited about? Maybe it's a workout, a quiet coffee and reading session, or working on a passion project. Having something you *want* to do makes a huge difference.

Third, optimize your sleep environment. Make sure your room is dark, quiet, and cool. A consistent bedtime routine (even on weekends!) signals to your body that it's time to wind down.

Fourth, the ""five more minutes"" trap is real. Try putting your alarm clock across the room so you *have* to get out of bed to turn it off. Once you're up, immediately expose yourself to bright light (sunlight is best) to help suppress melatonin.

Finally, be patient and consistent. It takes time to rewire your internal clock. Don't get discouraged if you slip up occasionally. Just get back on track the next day. Good luck!

t3_usjxu3,How to ignore the “I don’t feel like it” persisting feeling? [Need advice],"I would so love to know how to ignore my feelings and just get work done, especially the “wah I don’t feel like it” feeling. This feeling is so damn strong that no amount of motivation or willpower to persist is working with me

Even if I keep repeating affirmations in my head or try to force myself so hard to push past the feeling and keep working, I just end up quitting somehow. For the love of God, I need advice please 😅","It could be a bit of hit and miss, but I like the simplicity of it and for some tasks it does work. To shut down your mind you might try to count down 5,4,3,2,1 before the negative voice engages and ""just do it"". Mel Robins explains it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czz2qv2kBA0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czz2qv2kBA0)For me nothing works *all the time,* I have to switch things up a bit from time to time. And some days work just won't happen, I'm learning to live with that and let it go. The goal is to reduce the number of such days, but I doubt I will ever eliminate them completely. Good luck!","IN addition to leonmessi's response, you could also send your friend 100$ ahead of time and say ""send this back to me if and only if I go to the gym today""","I totally get where you're coming from. That ""I don't feel like it"" feeling can be a real hurdle. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Sometimes the thought of doing a big task can be overwhelming, but if you just focus on starting with a tiny part of it, it can be easier to get going. Also, try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes and commit to working for that short period. Often, once you start, you'll find it easier to keep going. Lastly, consider creating a routine or schedule that incorporates your tasks at the same time each day. This can help make the action feel more automatic and less reliant on how you're feeling in the moment. Keep at it, and remember, building discipline is a gradual process!","The ""I don't feel like it"" feeling is totally normal - but here's the thing: discipline isn't about feeling like doing something. It's about doing it anyway. Think of it like brushing your teeth - you probably don't wake up excited to do it, but you do it because it needs to be done.

Start by accepting that the feeling will be there. Don't fight it or try to push it away with affirmations. Instead, acknowledge it and then take action regardless. ""Yep, I don't feel like doing this right now. I'm going to start anyway.""

A practical approach that works well is the 2-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll work for just 2 minutes. That's it. Usually, once you start, you'll find it easier to continue. If after 2 minutes you still want to stop, you can - but often you'll have built enough momentum to keep going.

Another effective strategy is to break down your work into smaller, less daunting chunks. Instead of ""I need to study for 3 hours,"" try ""I'm going to read one page"" or ""I'll solve just this one problem."" This makes the task feel more manageable and gives you small wins to build on.

Remember: your feelings don't have to drive your actions. They're just passengers along for the ride - you're still the one steering the car.","I think the key here is to stop trying to ignore or fight the ""I don't feel like it"" feeling, and instead learn to acknowledge and work with it. Rather than relying on motivation or willpower, which can be fleeting, try building habits and routines that make it easier to get started on your work. For example, break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and create a schedule that you can stick to. That way, when the ""I don't feel like it"" feeling hits, you can tell yourself that you just need to do this one small task, and then take it from there. It's also important to recognize that it's normal to not always feel like doing something, and that it doesn't mean you're not capable of doing it. By focusing on building discipline and habits, rather than trying to muster up motivation, you can make progress even when you don't feel like it. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons behind your ""I don't feel like it"" feeling - is it boredom, fear, or something else? Once you understand what's driving that feeling, you can develop strategies to address it and stay on track.","Hey, I totally get that feeling – it's a motivation killer! It sounds like you're trying to brute force your way through it, which can work sometimes, but it's definitely not sustainable.

Instead of ignoring the feeling, maybe try acknowledging it, but then shrinking the task. Like, if you're supposed to work for an hour, tell yourself you'll just do 5 minutes. Seriously. Set a timer. Usually, once you get started, that initial resistance fades, and you'll keep going. If you *really* still don't feel like it after 5 minutes, then stop! But you'll probably find you're already in the flow.

Also, make sure you're not burnt out. Are you getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks? Sometimes that ""I don't feel like it"" feeling is your body telling you it needs something else. Good luck!

t3_pr596o,[Need Advice] I have the most important exam in my life in a few days and I am too scared to prepare,"I am just so overwhelmed I can’t study/write the paper. I am freaking out and am self sabotaging. I feel like I need someone to hold my hand and help me focus but I am an adult. Can’t find the courage and can only focus for 25min before panicking again. I am already so late. 
If I would write the paper I think I’d be fine and pass it. But I am wasting time for weeks now

I do so bad under pressure. Through university my fear got so bad. It’s the last exam of my life. It counts the most.

Do you have any mindsets or techniques that help ?

Edit: Rn I am productive again. But working really slow. I already read all your input and it has helped. I’ll reply later!

Update: Hey guys! I did it! I worked through three nights, didn’t get nearly any sleep and still went to work only to continue to prepare. I PASSED and I did much better than I thought I would! Now my marks have improved slightly and I never ever need to go through this shit again. Omg. It feels like starting a new life honestly. 

I wanted to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. I came back to this post when the panic came back and every tip I read helped me to focus. I am saving this post to revisit it and I hope this collection of great thoughts will help others too! 💛","I will give you my advice, but I think I should provide some context to help you decide what is it worth.

I am a doctor currently finishing a dual specialisation in two specialities, one in pathology and one in clinical medicine. I have had to sit a LOT of exams, some of which were among the most stressful and intense experiences of my life. I would have similar anxiety spirals in the lead up to them. Exams are stressful.

Before each exam, or during each storm of panic, the single most helpful thing I did was breathe. Sit up straight at your desk, close your eyes, and breathe in deeply, hold it for a few seconds, and then out. Google “box breathing” for more detailed techniques. It is amazing how much the simple act of breathing can pull you out of your thoughts, reaffirm you are alive, and that it will all be ok.

The second most important thing to do is take small steps. Set yourself small, achievable goals. Write a paragraph, or read some text, then break for 5 minutes and have a cup of tea, or some other small, easy reward. Lengthen the amount of time you spend working until you find your mind drifting, then another small break. Small breaks are ok, and essential to remaining productive over a whole session. I do 50 minute sessions, 10 minute breaks, but find the mix that is right for you. If you can only do 25 minutes, that is ok. 25min is > 0 min.

&#x200B;

Finally, beware the mental trap of exams. Exams trick you into thinking they are the most important event in your life, and are linked to your worth as a person/student/academic/whatever. They are neither. They are simply another small hurdle in  a very long journey getting you where you want to be.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, but regardless, good luck.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Breathe, small increments, take the long view.

edit: grammar.",I think his name is James Scholz on YouTube,"Congrats on passing your exam! It sounds like you really pushed through despite the pressure. For the future, consider trying the Pomodoro Technique to manage your focus and anxiety. It involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break, which can help make tasks feel more manageable. Also, remember that it's okay to ask for help or accountability from friends or study groups. They can provide support and help keep you on track. Lastly, practice self-compassion. It's easy to be hard on yourself, but recognizing your efforts and progress can boost your confidence and reduce stress. Good luck with everything ahead!","Congrats on passing! What an amazing accomplishment - you pushed through despite the anxiety and proved to yourself that you could do it. Those all-nighters and pushing yourself to keep going even when it felt impossible really paid off.

For anyone else reading this who's in a similar situation: When you're paralyzed by exam anxiety, start with tiny chunks. Set a timer for just 10 minutes of focused work. Anyone can do 10 minutes. Once you get going, it's easier to keep going. If you need to stop after 10 minutes, that's fine - take a short break and do another 10. 

The key is breaking through that initial wall of panic by making the task feel manageable. Your brain is trying to protect you by avoiding what feels threatening, but you can outsmart it by starting so small it doesn't trigger that fear response.

Remember: You don't need to feel ready or confident to take action. Action comes first, then confidence follows. Just take that first tiny step, then another, then another. Before you know it, you'll have built momentum.

To the OP - enjoy your well-deserved relief and pride in what you accomplished. You've proven you can push through intense pressure and succeed. That's a powerful lesson you can carry forward into future challenges.","Congratulations on passing your exam and overcoming your fears. It's amazing how you were able to push through and achieve your goal despite the immense pressure you were under. Your update is a great reminder that with the right mindset and support, we can accomplish what seems impossible. 

For anyone else who might be struggling with similar feelings of overwhelm and self-doubt, one technique that could be helpful is breaking down study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks, like you mentioned focusing for 25 minutes before taking a break. This can make the task less daunting and allow you to build momentum. Additionally, creating a schedule and sticking to it, even when it feels like the smallest step, can help build discipline and confidence. It's also important to remind yourself that it's okay to feel scared and that many people have been in your shoes before. Having a support system, whether it's online communities like this or friends and family, can provide the encouragement needed to keep moving forward.","Hey, congrats on passing! That's huge! It sounds like you went through hell to get there, but you did it.

Since you're saving this post, let's add a few things for future you (and anyone else reading):

First, remember that feeling of relief and accomplishment. Really lock it in. When the pressure starts building again, try to recall this victory. You *can* get through it.

Second, break things down even smaller. You mentioned 25-minute focus periods. That's great! Next time, aim for even shorter bursts if needed. 10 minutes of focused work is better than an hour of panicked avoidance. The Pomodoro Technique is your friend here.

Third, be kind to yourself. You're not a machine. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Acknowledge the feeling, but don't let it paralyze you. Maybe try a quick 5-minute meditation or some deep breathing exercises when the panic starts creeping in. There are tons of free apps for that.

Finally, now that you're done, really focus on recovery. Get some sleep, eat well, and do things you enjoy. You earned it! Building better habits is a marathon, not a sprint, and you just finished a tough leg. Time to recharge for the next one. You got this!

t3_zz45ua,"[Need Advice] Anyone else start something, become obsessed with it for a while, then lose interest and stop doing it?","This happens to me all the time. It's like I jump from one interest to another. I wanted to learn drums a few months ago and now I'm all about learning to dance. I'm watching tutorials on YouTube and teaching myself some moves but I'm worried if I'll keep this up. I'm worried I'll lose interest either when I find something new or when this gets too hard. I've been jumping from one thing to another all my life, a jack of all trades situation. I also keep wishing I continued the things I started few years ago so I would've been skilled in them now but that's not the case and that makes me sad. Anyone else like me? How do y'all deal with it?",It's likely that what you really enjoy is the feeling of discovering and learning about something new rather than the thing itself. Maybe you should look into making the process of learning more direclty enjoyable,"Omg I totally relate about the snide comments about unfinished projects! My family just discourages me from trying something new now because they think I won't follow through, I don't entirely blame them for this but it hurts fosho","Hey there! You're definitely not alone in this. It's pretty common to get excited about new things and then lose interest after a while. One thing that might help is setting small, achievable goals for each interest. Instead of thinking about mastering the drums or becoming a pro dancer, focus on learning one song or one dance routine. This way, you get a sense of accomplishment without feeling overwhelmed. Also, try scheduling specific times in your week dedicated to these activities. Consistency can help build a habit, even if it's just 15 minutes a day. Lastly, it's okay to have multiple interests! Being a ""jack of all trades"" can be a strength. Just remember, it's about enjoying the journey, not just the destination. Keep exploring and have fun with it!","This is a really common pattern - it's called the ""shiny object syndrome"" and tons of people deal with it. The good news is you can work with this tendency instead of fighting against it.

Try setting a minimum commitment period for new interests - say 3 months. During that time, you have to stick with it no matter what, even if something new catches your eye. This helps build follow-through while still letting you explore different things.

Another approach is to cycle between 2-3 core interests rather than constantly picking up new ones. For example, you could rotate between drums, dance, and one other activity. This way you're still getting variety, but you're building skills over time instead of starting from scratch.

The key is accepting that it's okay to have multiple interests - you don't have to master everything. But by setting some structure around how you pursue them, you can make meaningful progress while still keeping things fresh and engaging.

For the immediate situation with dance - try setting specific, achievable goals (like learning one full routine) rather than just practicing randomly. Having concrete targets makes it easier to push through when motivation dips. And if you do end up moving on eventually, that's fine - you'll have accomplished something tangible first.","I think many of us can relate to your experience. It's great that you're recognizing this pattern in yourself, as that's often the first step to making a change. One strategy you might consider is setting a ""minimum viable commitment"" for each new interest - instead of diving all-in and risking burnout, try committing to a smaller, manageable goal, like practicing dance for 10-15 minutes each day, or dedicating one day a week to learning. This can help you build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, you might reflect on what draws you to each new interest - is it the creative expression, the challenge, the social aspect? Identifying your underlying motivations can help you find common threads between your various pursuits and potentially transfer skills or habits from one area to another. As for dealing with the regret of not continuing past interests, try to focus on the present and what you can control - rather than wishing you'd stuck with something years ago, think about how you can apply the lessons you learned from those experiences to your current endeavors. Remember that it's okay to have multiple interests and explore different passions - the key is finding a balance that works for you and allows you to make progress without feeling like you're constantly starting over.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to get that initial burst of excitement and then have it fizzle out. The ""jack of all trades"" thing can feel cool, but also frustrating when you wish you'd stuck with something longer.

One thing that's helped me is to focus less on the ""obsession"" part and more on building a sustainable habit. Instead of going all-in on dance every day for hours, maybe try scheduling just 30 minutes, 3 times a week. Make it a non-negotiable appointment with yourself. That way, it's less likely to feel overwhelming and you're more likely to stick with it even when the initial excitement fades.

Also, try to identify *why* you lose interest. Is it the difficulty? The time commitment? Boredom? Once you know the trigger, you can plan for it. If it's difficulty, break down the learning into smaller, more manageable steps. If it's boredom, find ways to make it more engaging – maybe find a dance partner or join a class.

Finally, don't beat yourself up about the past. The fact that you're aware of this pattern is a huge step. Just focus on building better habits *now*, and you'll be surprised at how much progress you can make over time. Good luck!

t3_ste3n5,"[need advice] Procrastination on literally everything, even the things i like, i ruining my life","So i more and more notice how bad i actually procrastinate. But it is not just the things i don‘t like doing like studying etc. its also things i really enjoy or that are completely normal to do. I procrastinate on things like getting out of my bed, brushing teeth, going down to drink something, laying in another position when watching a video in bed(actually true :/ ) drawing(which i actually really enjoy doing), walking 3 steps to get lip balm even when my lips are really hurting, sports and so much more. I Basically procrastinate every single thing. And it’s not like im on my phone all the time(well most of the time) but i also procrastinate while doing nothing. And it isn‘t like an „out of sight out of mind“ type more like not doing but really wanting to do it, i feel really really shitty while procrastinating because all im thinking about is what i should be doing right now. This sometimes goes so far that i actually dont sleep at night, i can procrastinate for hours at night watching stupid youtube videos while feeling sick about myself. Then suddenly its 4 at night and i didn‘t do shit, so i tell myself it’s too late now and i basically wasted all that time for nothing at all. My grades are failing hard, i may have to attend this year again and i would have to leave all my friends behind.

I really don‘t know what to do anymore, i managed to read some books like Atomic Habits but i didn‘t do any of the methods. I used to have really good grades when i didn’t need to study as much and i also know that if i just study a can get excelent results but i just don‘t do it. Also if i start i have like an 10 minute motivation boost till i fall back into a depressive state of procrastination. I don‘t know if its adhd or something(ADHD is running in my Family like crazy, my dad is in early retirement because of it, and my brother who was diagnosed as well also has similar problems)

I just feel like im fucking my entire life up because i achive little to nothing every day. Everytime i go to bed i feel like i wasted this day once again.

(Sorry for bad spelling im typing this on my phone and english is my second language)","Same. And I haven't found any way or method that universally, always helps me cope better with this. In a way that makes sense - to be human means to operate in changeable situations, and to not always do what should be done. So the solutions are also going to look different day-to-day and sometimes they won't work. The key thing is to try different stuff, to have lots of different ""tools"" to try in this situation, but even that will not always work. One of the most difficult hurdles is using a tool in the first place, just as you articulate. But, I believe you can do it at least some of the time! I believe you can develop some tools for moment-to-moment use. And hopefully you can find something to help longer-term too (I agree that depression and ADHD are possible underlying things that are happening here).

Some things that help me, to give you an example of what I mean by ""tools"":

-Lots of forgiveness. Actively speaking to myself in a kind, forgiving, compassionate way. It's important because forgiveness clears my energy and creates security in myself, which encourages me to risk trying things that might not work. Plus kindness is the nice thing to do. It's soothing. It's a way to parent myself through difficult feelings. If I do want to be mean to myself, I try to at least do it in a joking or ironic way to make myself laugh in the process. Laughter makes things seem less serious. But generally, I assume if I can't do a task that it means I am feeling vulnerable in some way and need soothing and compassion. I could speak to myself kindly or ask someone else for a hug or something like that.

-Deciding a first action, setting a 5 minute timer, then acting once the timer goes off. It's like that ""countdown"" technique people use to get themselves moving, but with a longer range, to give the subconscious mind time to adjust to the idea. One reason to procrastinate can be a struggle with making transitions between different activities (changing from activity A to activity B). Giving myself a slower pace of change can help me with transitions sometimes at least. And making the signal external to me reduces the work my mind has to do. Often I am thinking ""do it now!"" and I don't act, in fact I feel I can't. But sometimes when the timer goes off 5 minutes after I decided my action, I can act. If not, I can set the timer 1-2 more times to see if it works then. If not, only 15 minutes have elapsed and I know that I tried to find a way out of being trapped and that because this didn't work, I can see that the problem is not going to be easily solved this time.

-""Wiggle your big toe"". It's a scene in the film Kill Bill where the character must get her legs to work, so she starts with intensive focus on one toe. Can't do a big movement like turning your whole body or sitting up? Try a small one.

-Promise myself a reward and then give it to myself once I have done something. Even something small like putting on the lip balm could count if it's something difficult for you and if thinking about a reward for doing it helps you actually do it. Don't judge what you consider a reward, figure it out and accept it and work with it. (I am food motivated. I loathe the idea of leaving the house as a reward because it feels like a task in itself.)

-Physically changing my location/movements while keeping my mind blank. Don't know why this works, but it does sometimes help me. For example, I was standing up staring down at a whiteboard, trying to get motivation to clean it so I could use it. But I just felt dread and reluctance. Then I made my mind blank, and just sat down next to the whiteboard, only seeing it through my peripheral vision. Pretty quickly, I felt a change internally. Suddenly the task felt doable and I got up and got going with it, no internal ""forcing"" necessary. If I need to clean, making my body just mindlessly pick things up and put them other places can actually get me into the right frame of mind to genuinely start cleaning. It's like, if figuring things out mentally isn't helping, then engage the body first!

-Try and really dissect certain situations for what is creating discomfort, reluctance or dread. This might be extremely difficult (it is for me), so it's not somethingto push - but gently be aware of. For example, I realised I often don't leave bed because I dread being cold. It took me a long time to recognise that, even though it is simple. Judging that doesn't help me - wrapping up warmer while in bed in preparation to leave does. Underlying reasons can be much less obviously connected to problems, though. My therapist guided me through a decision making technique and it starts with ""feel and acknowledge"". Before deciding what you should do, perhaps try to understand yourself in that moment? Only after doing that can you negotiate between your wants and your needs. One way to cultivate awareness of this is to ask yourself whether anything negative has happened recently, that might be affecting your mood, energy or concentration in general. Because those things affect the decisions you make, if you are struggling in the afternoon and in the morning you argued with someone, the struggle might have little to do with the task and everything to do with the argument. Finally, deeper things like fears and insecurities can prevent action - in this case you cannot brute force a solution, but need a gentle set of steps to follow, or an alternative way of looking at the task so that it doesn't feel so scary and important.

-That brings me to ask whether you have received any external support recently? It seems like some of the problems here are self-sustaining in the sense that you feel behind and unable to catch up, which would increase your worries and stresses, which would decrease what you can cope with. Perhaps someone else can help you see the situation in a different light that seems more manageable, could get you some supports so you're not facing it alone? 

These things listed above are just possibilities. And, I am sorry I added much of my own experience - you are your own person and solutions will come from you, not from others. But I do know what it's like to go through this. I hope this post helps you a bit. Please let me know whether anything I said was unclear.","Also, it may not be ADHD, there could just be some issue with executive dysfunction (you can't connect wanting to do a thing, with actually doing the thing).","Hey there! It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination, and I want to say you're not alone in this. Many people face similar challenges, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few things you might try:

1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about everything you need to do. Try breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if you want to draw, just commit to setting up your drawing space. Once you're there, it might be easier to start.

2. **Set Timers**: Use a timer to work in short bursts, like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break). This can help you get started and maintain focus without feeling overwhelmed.

3. **Create a Routine**: Establishing a daily routine can help reduce decision fatigue. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and schedule time for activities you enjoy and need to do.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you mentioned spending a lot of time on your phone, consider using apps that limit screen time or block distracting sites during certain hours.

5. **Seek Support**: If you suspect ADHD might be a factor, it could be helpful to talk to a professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your situation.

Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself as you work through this. You've got this!","Given the family history of ADHD and the symptoms you're describing, getting evaluated by a mental health professional would be a smart first step. But while you work on that, let's focus on some immediate strategies you can use.

Start incredibly small. Like, microscopically small. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE tiny habit - maybe just putting your feet on the floor when you wake up. Don't worry about the full morning routine yet. Just feet on floor. Make it so stupidly easy you can't talk yourself out of it.

The key is breaking the paralysis cycle. Right now you're stuck in a loop where everything feels overwhelming, so you do nothing, which makes you feel worse, which makes everything feel even more overwhelming. We need to prove to your brain that you can follow through on intentions, even tiny ones.

For the late night YouTube spiral - install a website blocker that activates at a certain time. Make the decision once, in advance, rather than relying on willpower when you're tired. Even if you don't sleep right away, lying in bed without screens is better than feeding the cycle.

For studying, try the 5-minute rule. Tell yourself you only have to study for 5 minutes. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you start. If not, that's fine - you still did 5 minutes more than zero. Tomorrow, do 5 minutes again.

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is to start building evidence that you can do things, even small things. Each tiny win creates momentum. Your brain starts to believe ""I'm someone who follows through"" instead of ""I always procrastinate.""

Take it one absurdly small step at a time. You don't have to fix everything today. You just have to put your feet on the floor.","It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and it's affecting all areas of your life. First, let's acknowledge that recognizing the problem is a huge step, so kudos to you for that. It's also great that you've read books like Atomic Habits, even if you haven't implemented the methods yet. 

One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one or two things you want to work on each day. Make a tiny goal for yourself, like ""I'll get out of bed and brush my teeth as soon as I wake up"" or ""I'll study for 10 minutes without any distractions."" These tiny wins can add up and help build momentum.

It's also interesting that you mention having a 10-minute motivation boost before falling back into procrastination. This could be a clue to working with your energy levels rather than against them. Try breaking down tasks into shorter intervals, like 10-15 minutes of focused work followed by a short break. This might help you stay on track and avoid burnout.

Regarding ADHD, it's definitely worth exploring if you suspect it might be a factor. Talking to a doctor or a therapist could provide valuable insights and help you develop strategies tailored to your needs.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's clear that you're beating yourself up over procrastination, but remember that everyone struggles with it to some extent. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't give up – keep working on making small changes, and celebrate your tiny wins along the way.","Hey, I really get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're stuck in a tough cycle, but it's definitely something you can break.

First off, don't beat yourself up too much. Recognizing the problem is the first step. You've already done that!

Since you mentioned Atomic Habits, maybe try REALLY small steps. Like, instead of ""brush teeth,"" it's ""put toothpaste on toothbrush."" Seriously. Make it ridiculously easy. Once you've done that, the rest of brushing your teeth is way more likely to happen. Same with getting out of bed – maybe just put one foot on the floor. The goal is to lower the activation energy for these tasks.

Also, about the ADHD thing – definitely worth looking into. Since it runs in your family, talking to a doctor or therapist could be a game-changer. Even if it's not ADHD, they can help you figure out what's going on and develop strategies.

For the studying, try the Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. It's less daunting than a huge study session, and you might find that 25 minutes turns into more.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix this overnight. Celebrate the small wins, and don't let setbacks derail you completely. You got this!

t3_oj6km5,[Need Advice] How do you keep going when you think your failing at everything,"Lately I have been feeling that in whatever I do , I fail in. I’ve been working out for a while now , and I feel I see no progress and it sucks. The same goes with relationships and goals I set for myself. Am I just being impatient or am I supposed to change the way I’m doing things. Anything helps.","Change your definition of winning. 

Don't define it based on what you can't control. Define your wins by the actions you take not the outcome of those actions.",-Michael Scott,"Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough patch, but remember, progress isn't always visible right away. When it comes to working out, sometimes the changes are happening internally before you see them externally. Try tracking small wins, like lifting a bit more weight or feeling more energetic. As for relationships and goals, it's worth reflecting on whether your expectations are realistic or if there's a small tweak you can make to your approach. Patience is key, and sometimes it's about adjusting your methods rather than overhauling everything. Keep going, and don't be too hard on yourself—every step forward counts, even if it feels small.","Progress often feels invisible when you're in the thick of it. Think of it like watching grass grow - you won't notice daily changes, but look back after a month and the difference is clear. For working out specifically, try taking progress photos or logging your weights/reps rather than relying on how you feel. Having concrete data helps cut through that discouraging ""nothing's working"" mindset.

As for feeling like you're failing at multiple things - that's actually pretty normal when building new habits or pursuing goals. Success isn't linear. The key is to break down your larger goals into smaller, measurable chunks. Instead of ""get in shape,"" aim for ""do 3 workouts this week."" Instead of ""improve relationships,"" maybe it's ""reach out to one friend for coffee.""

One thing that helped me was keeping a simple journal where I write down one small win each day, no matter how tiny. Some days it might just be ""got out of bed"" or ""drank enough water."" Over time, those small wins add up and help you see your progress more clearly.

Remember that consistency beats intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to burn yourself out trying to do everything perfectly. Give yourself credit for showing up and keeping at it, even when it feels like you're spinning your wheels.","It's normal to feel like you're not making progress, especially when you're putting in a lot of effort. One thing that might help is to take a step back and re-evaluate how you're measuring success. Instead of focusing on the end goal, try breaking it down into smaller, achievable milestones. For example, with your workout routine, instead of getting discouraged by the lack of visible progress, focus on showing up consistently and completing your workouts - that in itself is a win. Additionally, consider seeking out accountability and support from friends, family, or a mentor who can offer guidance and encouragement. It's also important to remember that progress is rarely linear, and it's okay to make adjustments along the way. Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to change your approach - it doesn't mean you're failing, it just means you're learning and adapting. Keep moving forward, even if it feels like a small step at a time, and celebrate those small victories along the way.","Hey, it's super common to feel like you're spinning your wheels, especially when you're putting in effort. It sounds like you're hitting that wall in a few different areas, which makes it even tougher.

First, with working out, are you tracking your progress in a measurable way? Sometimes progress is happening, but it's hard to see without data. Try logging your weights, reps, or even just how you feel during/after workouts. Also, consider if your routine needs a tweak. Maybe you've plateaued and need to change up the exercises or intensity.

As for relationships and goals, break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. Big goals can feel overwhelming, but small wins build momentum. And with relationships, are you communicating your needs and expectations clearly? Sometimes a little adjustment in communication can make a big difference.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to re-evaluate and adjust your approach. Maybe you need to redefine what ""success"" looks like for you right now. It's not always about massive leaps; sometimes it's about consistent effort and small improvements. You got this!

t3_10ntzgh,How to stop imagining conversations? [Need Advice],"I obsessively envision conversations in my head where someone says something rude/demeaning to me and I make a good comeback. I suspect this has something to do with me being a pushover with terribly low self esteem but I’m fed up with it being the only thing I can think about, a lot of the time I don’t even realise it until I’m mid-thought.

It’s easy to say ‘stop imagining it’ but when it’s your only source of confidence, the ability to just ‘stop’ vanishes.
It’s also easy to say don’t be a pushover but I’m very scared of people (tfw bad childhood full of screaming parents) and I don’t know how to get a backbone.

How can I stop? This started a few years ago and it’s plagued my life since. Some extra information, I’m turning 19 this year, I’m neurotypical (I was evaluated in 2021 because I can’t make friends, but turns out I’m just a weirdo from a bad family), and I’ve been trying to stop this for years now but it feels impossible, I give in every time because it actually makes me feel good about myself. I can’t afford therapy and tried a few years ago but it didn’t really help for no reason other than they just weren’t equipped or knowledgeable about what I’m dealing it.","When I catch myself doing that i tell myself  ""stop hurting your own feelings."" It sounds cheesy but it reminds me that i am just creating my own negative energy.","Ooh, I like this one.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a tough cycle, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few steps that might help you break this habit and build some confidence:

1. **Awareness and Redirection**: Start by trying to catch yourself when you begin imagining these conversations. It might help to keep a small notebook or use a notes app on your phone to jot down when it happens. Once you notice it, try redirecting your thoughts to something else, like a hobby or a task you enjoy.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: Consider incorporating some mindfulness exercises into your routine. This can help you become more aware of your thoughts and give you more control over them. Apps like Headspace or Calm offer free resources to get started.

3. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have these thoughts, but remind yourself that they don't define you. Try to replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations. It might feel awkward at first, but it can gradually improve your self-esteem.

4. **Assertiveness Training**: Since you mentioned being a pushover, practicing assertiveness can be really beneficial. There are plenty of free resources online, including videos and articles, that can teach you how to express your needs and stand up for yourself in a healthy way.

5. **Community Support**: Even if therapy isn't an option right now, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share experiences and get support from others who understand what you're going through.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You're already taking a big step by seeking advice, and that's something to be proud of. Good luck!","This is actually a pretty common coping mechanism - your mind is trying to build confidence and process social anxiety through these imagined scenarios. While it provides temporary relief, you're right that it's not a healthy long-term solution.

Here's what's worked for others in similar situations: When you catch yourself in these thought loops, try redirecting that mental energy into real-world confidence building. Start small - maybe practice making eye contact at the store, or giving a genuine compliment to someone. These tiny wins create actual positive memories to replace the imagined ones.

For the underlying confidence issues, consider joining a supportive group activity where social interaction isn't the main focus - maybe a running club, volunteer organization, or hobby group. This lets you build social skills gradually while having a shared activity as a buffer.

You can also work on physical confidence builders that don't require other people - regular exercise, learning a new skill, or completing small daily challenges you set for yourself. The goal is to create real achievements that prove to yourself that you're capable and worthy of respect.

When you feel the urge to imagine these scenarios, try asking yourself ""What small thing can I do right now that would make me genuinely proud?"" Then do that instead. Over time, you'll build a foundation of real confidence that makes those imagined conversations less necessary.

Remember that building genuine confidence is a gradual process. You don't need to transform overnight - just focus on making small improvements each day. Your awareness of the issue and desire to change it is already a huge first step.","It sounds like these imagined conversations are serving as a coping mechanism for you, providing a sense of confidence and control that's missing in your real-life interactions. To break this cycle, you might want to try addressing the underlying issues - your low self-esteem and fear of people - rather than just trying to stop the thoughts cold turkey. Since therapy isn't an option for you right now, you could look into online resources like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) workbooks or self-help books that focus on building confidence and assertiveness. 

Additionally, you might find it helpful to practice small acts of assertiveness in low-stakes situations, like speaking up in a group setting or expressing your opinion to a friend. This can help you build confidence and develop a sense of self-efficacy that's not reliant on these imagined conversations. It's also worth exploring ways to challenge and reframe the negative self-talk that might be contributing to these thoughts - for example, by writing down positive affirmations or practicing mindfulness exercises. Remember that overcoming deep-seated habits and fears takes time and patience, so be gentle with yourself and try to focus on making progress rather than achieving perfection.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. Those imagined conversations can be super addictive, especially when they're a way to feel in control. It's tough to just ""stop,"" so let's look at some alternatives.

First, recognize the trigger. You mentioned you often don't realize you're doing it until you're already in the middle of it. Try to catch yourself earlier. Maybe keep a small notebook and jot down what you were doing or thinking right before you started imagining the conversation. Over time, you might see a pattern.

Second, replace the habit. Instead of just trying to stop, try redirecting that mental energy. When you catch yourself, consciously shift your thoughts to something else. It could be a simple math problem, a song lyric, or even just focusing on your breathing for a minute. The key is to have a go-to replacement ready.

Third, work on building real-world confidence. Since the imagined conversations are filling a need for feeling assertive, try small steps in real life. Start with something super low-stakes, like asking a question in a store or politely disagreeing with a friend about something minor. The more you practice being assertive in small ways, the less you might need those imaginary scenarios.

Finally, regarding your past trauma, while therapy is ideal, there are resources you can access in the meantime. Look into free online resources about assertiveness training and managing anxiety. Even just understanding the psychology behind your reactions can be empowering. There are also some great self-help books on these topics.

It's a process, and it's okay to slip up. Just keep practicing, and be kind to yourself. You've got this.

t3_w0amka,"[Need Advice] I did it and now I'm depressed, now what?","During lockdown 2 years ago I decided to take my life seriously. I started exercising, got back into reading, discovered what I wanted to do and re-enrolled in study.

Before then I drank too much, stayed up all night, smoked, worked dead end jobs and/or had stints of unemployment. In high school I was a straight A student.

Cut to now - I did really well in my course, got a full-time well-paid job in my industry (with nice people), I started playing sport (full-contact aggressive sport) and have gotten pretty fit. I have a partner who supports all this.

So why do I feel so abundantly depressed? I can barely take care of myself, I suddenly feel like a bad friend bad partner bad worker bad player. 

I feel bad at everything. I feel unsatisfied with life. I miss feeling light and irresponsible honestly. 

I don't know what to do with this feeling it's so unmotivating, it's not how I expected to feel at all. It honestly makes me want to drink.

So I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this, and how they approached it. (I'm 28F btw, if that matters)","Probably because you’re doing what you think you should than what you truly wish to do 

You say you discovered what you wanted to do but is it truly what you want to do? Are you using societies expectations to find a path which is acceptable to it’s metric. 


You said you got into reading, exercising and studied. All of these are fantastic but they’re also the cookie cutter approach of being productive, rounded and living a balanced lifestyle. 

Is it true to you is the question? I’m not saying give up reading or exercising. What I’m saying is, you need to find your bliss not what you think will bring you bliss.

Which also isn’t the drinking, smoking or dead end jobs. 

You don’t need to set the world on fire. You just need to enjoy your time here.",You're ignorant. Stop talking about something you clearly know nothing about.,"Hey there! First off, it's really impressive how much you've turned your life around. It sounds like you've achieved a lot, but it's also totally normal to feel a bit lost or down even after hitting big milestones. Sometimes, when we focus so much on achieving goals, we forget to check in with ourselves about what truly makes us happy day-to-day.

One thing that might help is to reintroduce some of that lightness and spontaneity you miss. Maybe set aside some time each week to do something just for fun, without any pressure to be productive or ""good"" at it. It could be something creative, a hobby, or just a day where you let yourself relax and do whatever you feel like.

Also, consider talking to someone about how you're feeling. A therapist or counselor can provide a safe space to explore these feelings and help you find balance. Remember, it's okay to feel this way, and reaching out for support is a strong step forward. You're not alone in this, and things can get better. Keep taking care of yourself!","First off - congrats on making such massive positive changes in your life. What you're experiencing is actually pretty common when people transform their lives dramatically. It's like getting everything you thought you wanted, only to feel oddly empty afterwards.

The thing is, when we're in ""improvement mode"" we have clear goals and metrics - lose weight, get the job, finish the degree. But once we achieve those things, we can feel a bit lost without that next clear target.

Consider this: maybe it's time to shift your focus from external achievements to finding meaning and joy in what you've built. Instead of viewing your job/relationship/fitness as things to maintain, try setting new kinds of goals - maybe creative projects, learning new skills within your sport, or finding ways to mentor others who want to make similar life changes.

The urge to return to old habits is your brain seeking familiar comfort, but drinking won't fix the underlying emptiness. You might want to explore therapy - not because anything's wrong, but because having support while navigating this new chapter can be really valuable.

For now, try to be patient with yourself. You've climbed a huge mountain - it's okay to take time adjusting to the view from the top. Maybe start a journal to track small daily wins and set some fresh micro-goals that excite you. The discipline you've already shown proves you've got what it takes to figure this out too.","It sounds like you've made some incredible changes in your life over the past couple of years, and it's amazing that you've found a career path and activities that bring you fulfillment. However, it's not uncommon to feel a sense of emptiness or disconnection after achieving our goals, especially when we've had to work so hard to get there. It's like you've been climbing this mountain, and now that you're at the top, you're looking around and wondering what's next.

One thing to consider is that you might be experiencing a bit of an identity crisis. You've spent so much time focusing on self-improvement and becoming this new version of yourself, but in doing so, you may have lost touch with some of the things that brought you joy and made you feel carefree. It's possible that you're mourning the loss of your old self, or at least the freedom and spontaneity that came with it.

Rather than trying to suppress these feelings or beat yourself up over them, maybe try to explore what's really going on underneath. What are some things that you used to enjoy doing before you started making all these changes? Are there any hobbies or activities that you've had to put on the backburner that you could revisit? It might be helpful to find ways to incorporate some of that old carefree spirit into your new life, even if it's just in small ways.

It's also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings. They can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore your emotions and develop strategies for managing them. And hey, it's okay to not have all the answers right now - it's normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. Just taking the time to acknowledge and validate your feelings is a huge step forward.","Hey, it sounds like you've made some incredible changes in your life, so first off, huge congrats on that! It's totally understandable to feel a bit lost even after achieving so much. Sometimes the ""after"" doesn't match the ""before"" picture we had in our heads.

It sounds like you might be experiencing a bit of an identity crisis. You've worked hard to become this new version of yourself, but maybe you haven't fully integrated it with who you were before. It's okay to miss parts of your old life, even the ""irresponsible"" bits. Maybe try to find healthy ways to incorporate some of that lightness back in. Could you schedule in some fun, low-pressure activities? Think about what you enjoyed before that wasn't destructive, and see if you can bring some of that back.

Also, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you have to be *perfect* at everything now. You're a beginner in your sport, relatively new to your job, and still figuring out the partner thing. Give yourself some grace! Focus on progress, not perfection. Maybe set smaller, more achievable goals in each area of your life.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of talking to someone. A therapist could give you tools to navigate these feelings of dissatisfaction and help you integrate your past and present selves. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help. You've got this!

So you're not really ""getting ready to work"" so you're more motivated. But you don't do it in the morning because now that blind motivation is actually coming to fruition and you're now unmotivated. It's akin to being really excited to go skydiving and then getting freaked out by jumping out of the plane. You knew what you needed to do prior, but when faced with the open door 5k ft in the air, all of a sudden you freeze.","It's pretty common to feel more motivated at night because your mind is winding down from the day's activities, and you might feel a sense of urgency to get things done before the day ends. In the morning, though, your brain is still waking up, and it can be tough to get back into that motivated mindset. One thing that might help is creating a simple morning routine that includes something you enjoy or look forward to. This can help kickstart your day on a positive note. Also, try to set small, achievable goals for the morning to build momentum. Over time, this can help you carry some of that evening motivation into the next day. Remember, consistency is key, so keep experimenting with what works best for you!","This is a really common pattern - getting a burst of motivation at night but struggling to follow through in the morning. The key is understanding that motivation isn't reliable, but you can work with your natural energy patterns.

Try this: When you feel that evening motivation, use it to set yourself up for success the next day. Write down 1-2 specific things you want to accomplish, prepare what you'll need, and make it as easy as possible for ""morning you"" to get started. The smaller and more concrete the task, the better.

For the morning itself, don't wait for motivation. Instead, focus on building a consistent wake-up routine that doesn't require much thinking. Start with something really simple like drinking a glass of water or making your bed. The goal is to get moving before your brain has time to talk you out of it.

Remember that this isn't about forcing yourself to become a morning person. It's about creating systems that work whether you feel motivated or not. Start small, be consistent, and gradually your morning resistance will decrease.

What specific task would you like to tackle first thing tomorrow? Sometimes just naming it can help make it feel more manageable.","It sounds like you're experiencing a common phenomenon where your motivation and energy levels seem to peak in the evenings, only to crash in the mornings. One possible explanation is that your brain is more alert and focused at night due to the release of certain neurotransmitters, but then crashes after a poor night's sleep or lack of morning routine. To combat this, you might want to try establishing a consistent wake-up time and creating a morning routine that signals to your brain that it's time to be productive. This could be as simple as getting some natural light, exercising, or meditating for a few minutes each morning. Additionally, you could try breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling them in the evening when you feel most motivated, then reviewing and building on your progress in the morning. By doing so, you might find that your motivation becomes more consistent throughout the day.","Hey, I get that feeling! It's super common. A couple of things might be happening. First, nighttime often feels less pressured – the day's over, so you feel free to dream and plan. Second, maybe you're not getting enough sleep, so your willpower is drained by morning.

Try this: Before bed, write down *one* super small, achievable task you'll do first thing in the morning. Like, ""drink a glass of water"" or ""stretch for 5 minutes."" The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Getting that first win can kickstart your motivation for the rest of the day. Also, experiment with your sleep schedule and see if getting more rest helps. Good luck!

The thoughts/opinions that best define you're character/personality  aren't your very first thoughts on a subject, but your second ones.

The first opinions that come to your mind are usually snap judgements that involve little thought and so they tend to reflect close associations your brain has made, aka biases(even if they might not be logical), and so they are mostly determined by the environment you were raised in.

On the other hand, the second opinions you form about a subject require you to put in some more thought into it, which forces you to be more rational in your judgement, because you can apply you're reasoning skills now.

Therefore, your second thoughts on a subject are a much better reflection of character because they reveal how rational you are, and how much you let your own biases influence you.

If you are already recognizing that you're initial reactions around poc are irrational and caused by your personal bias against them, then you are already going in the right direction.

Good luck with your problem, and remember, everyone has their own biases, what's important is that you don't let them override your reason. Biases are just mental hurdles meant to be overcome.","I had to tell my ex to STOP visiting horrible sites that were so anti-women, red-Pill-ish in nature.

2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it's based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.

3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.

4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.

5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds. Listening to their stories and perspectives can be eye-opening and help you grow.

Remember, change takes time and effort, but acknowledging the problem is a huge first step. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself as you work through this.","Recognizing these thought patterns and wanting to change them is a great first step. Breaking free from prejudiced thinking takes conscious effort and practice, but it's absolutely achievable through discipline and intentional habit-building.

Start by catching yourself in the moment when these thoughts arise. Instead of letting them flow automatically, pause and actively challenge them. Ask yourself: ""What evidence actually supports this view? Am I making unfair generalizations? What other factors might explain this situation?""

A practical approach is to deliberately expose yourself to perspectives and stories that humanize people from different backgrounds. Find documentaries, books, or podcasts created by people from the groups you have biases against. Learning about individual experiences and achievements helps break down stereotypes.

Another effective technique is to practice ""replacement thinking."" When you notice a prejudiced thought, immediately replace it with a more rational, fact-based observation. For example, if you catch yourself thinking ""that's typical of [race],"" consciously shift to ""that's typical of individuals who make poor choices, regardless of background.""

Remember that changing thought patterns takes time. Be patient with yourself while remaining committed to improvement. Each time you successfully challenge and redirect a biased thought, you're building new neural pathways and better habits of thinking.

Consider keeping a private journal to track your progress and reflect on what triggers these thoughts. This can help you identify patterns and measure your improvement over time.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change harmful thought patterns, so kudos to you for recognizing the issue and seeking help. Recognizing and challenging our own biases is a difficult but crucial step in personal growth. One strategy that might help is to practice critical thinking when consuming media - ask yourself if the narrative being presented is balanced, if it's perpetuating stereotypes, and what other factors might be at play. Additionally, try to seek out diverse perspectives and engage with content that challenges your existing views. When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and reflect on why you're thinking that way - is it based on personal experience, or is it a product of societal conditioning? By becoming more aware of your thoughts and actively working to reframe them, you can start to break down those biases. It's also important to remember that having racist thoughts doesn't define your worth as a person, but rather it's an opportunity to learn and grow. You might consider exploring resources on unconscious bias, privilege, and social justice to help broaden your understanding. Remember, changing thought patterns takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep working towards a more empathetic and inclusive mindset.","Hey, it's really commendable that you're recognizing these thoughts and wanting to change them. That takes courage.

It sounds like you're dealing with ingrained biases, and breaking those down takes conscious effort and discipline. One thing that might help is actively seeking out positive stories and perspectives from the groups you're having these thoughts about. Make a conscious effort to diversify your social media feed and the news sources you consume. Expose yourself to different viewpoints and experiences.

Another thing you could try is challenging your own thoughts when they arise. When you catch yourself thinking something racist, ask yourself: ""Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? Is there another way to interpret this situation?"" It's like training a muscle – the more you challenge those thoughts, the weaker they become.

It's also worth considering *why* you might be having these thoughts. Are you feeling insecure or threatened in some way? Sometimes, biases are a way of trying to feel superior or protect ourselves. Understanding the root cause can help you address the issue more effectively.

Finally, be patient with yourself. This isn't going to change overnight. It's a process of unlearning and relearning. Acknowledge your progress, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. Keep at it, and you'll gradually start to see a shift in your thinking. Good luck!

t3_ovy4lf,[Need Advice]This out of desperation,"(M23) I am going nowhere and my days are playing in a loop.
I haven't had a productive day in a year . I dont have any  motivation i scroll though reddit and YouTube all day. I blame outside influences for my failures.
I just sit in parents house and act like I am studying for an exam to get a job . Nothing interests me. I dont even remember what it is to be productive. 
The regert is neither i am enjoying my life nor doing anything to improve.","Ah yes, classic depression. I was in your shoes. Pretended to study and go to college library to trick my parents. Was on youtube and reddit browsing for 16 hours a day. I would refresh youtube and reddit non stop but because I was on it for too long, I'd run out of new things to watch. It was for dopamine rush.

I'd assume discipline is not your issue, I've worked out 1-2 hours a day, ran everyday for 1 hour, lost 25kg and got somewhat muscular, that took discipline, but when I sat down in my chair to study, I couldn't. 

I chugged coffee, energy drinks, forced myself to study but nope, it did not work. This was last year, I was 23 then. I remember crying to my parents because I could not focus. 

Watched thousands of videos of Jocko Willinks, Gary vee and all those motivational gurus to ""discipline"" myself. It did not work. This was not a matter of discipline. 

Imagine if you were digging a hole but for no reason. Why the fuck would you do that, you're gonna last a day and stop because there is literally no point. But imagine if you know there was diamond under there, and it was only a matter of time until you dug up that diamond. Now, you're gonna start digging.

What is the difference? One has a goal, the other does not.   

You need to set a goal. And a plan to get there.","I agree with the others, get a decent job and grow social skills. Then get into a gym or workout from home. 

Job, social life, and fitness. 3 things to work on and won't overwhelm you.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but the good news is that you can definitely turn things around. Start small—pick one thing you want to change and focus on that. Maybe set a goal to limit your time on Reddit and YouTube to just an hour a day. Use the extra time to explore something new, like a hobby or a skill you've been curious about. It doesn't have to be related to your career; just something that sparks a bit of interest. Also, try setting a simple daily routine. Even if it's just waking up at the same time and going for a short walk, it can help create a sense of structure. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. You've got this!","Hey there. What you're describing is a really common struggle, especially after extended periods of low productivity. The good news is you've already taken the first step by acknowledging the situation and reaching out.

Start incredibly small. Pick one 5-minute task for tomorrow morning - it could be making your bed, doing a few pushups, or reading one page of a book. The key is to make it so ridiculously easy that you can't talk yourself out of it. Do just that one thing consistently for a week.

For the scrolling habit, try setting a 30-minute timer when you pick up your phone. When it goes off, get up and walk around for 2 minutes. This creates a pattern interrupt and makes you more conscious of time passing.

As for the job hunt - break it into tiny chunks. Instead of ""studying,"" pick one specific topic and work on it for just 25 minutes. Use the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focus, 5-minute break. Even one Pomodoro per day is progress.

Remember that motivation follows action, not the other way around. You won't suddenly feel motivated one day - you have to start moving first, even if it's just baby steps. The momentum will build naturally from there.

Check back in after trying these small changes for a week. Sometimes the hardest part is just getting started.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and that's a tough place to be. First, let's acknowledge that recognizing the problem is a huge step, so kudos to you for admitting it and seeking help. It might be helpful to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try setting a tiny goal for yourself each day, like dedicating 10 minutes to something productive, whether that's reading, journaling, or even just taking a short walk. As for the outside influences, it's easy to get caught up in blaming others, but try to focus on what you can control, which is your own actions. You might also want to explore what used to interest you before you felt like you lost motivation - was there something you enjoyed doing? Revisiting old hobbies or passions could be a great way to spark some excitement again. Lastly, consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about how you're feeling - it's possible they're not aware of the extent of your struggles and may be able to offer support or help you find resources to get back on track. Remember, getting out of this rut won't happen overnight, but taking it one step at a time can make a big difference.","Hey man, I've been in similar ruts before, and it sucks. It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of avoidance. The key is to break it, even in small ways.

First, stop pretending to study. Seriously. Acknowledge to yourself (and maybe even your parents) that what you're doing isn't working. Honesty is the first step.

Next, pick ONE tiny thing you can do tomorrow that's productive. Don't aim for a complete life overhaul. Maybe it's just going for a 20-minute walk, cleaning your room, or spending 30 minutes actually applying for jobs. Just one thing.

The next day, try to do that one thing again, and maybe add another tiny task. The goal is to build momentum, not to suddenly become a productivity machine.

Also, consider limiting your screen time. Even just an hour less of YouTube/Reddit can make a difference. Replace it with something else, even if it's just staring out the window.

Finally, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. It happens. Just get back on track the next day. It's about progress, not perfection. You got this.

t3_wuwy6h,[Need Advice] I am turning 22 and I just feel like a loser and a failure.,"I am turning 22 in a few months and I feel very lost and confused, so much so I feel like a loser and failure in life.

To give more context, I moved back to my parents place in 2020 when COVID struck and I graduated from university last year(2021) during COVID, I still stay with my parents and haven’t yet started a full time job, I really don’t know what I want to do, I have given a shot at these professional qualifications and I have failed 3 times back to back. I don’t know whether I should continuing pursuing these qualifications. I really don’t know what I want to do or where I want to work. 

My Mental Health and Physical Health have also taken a dip, since all my friends are quite far away from my parents place, I barely have anyone talk to or just have social interactions. I have also gained over 20kgs in the past two years. I am barely motivated to workout or just take care of myself, I feel stuck and just sad and lonely in life. 

To add to the misery, it really hurts when you see your friends and peers achieving things in life, starting full time jobs or having stuff figured out and doing something in their life. I just feel like I have wasted a year of my life. I feel so lost. 

Please I am desperate for some help, just need a wake up call, please please,somebody just help me, I really don’t know what do or where to start anymore.


EDIT - I am overwhelmed with the amount of response I got guys, thanks a ton guys for the advice, I sat and read all the replies and thanks a lot guys for the words of encouragement, I really feel much better now. Again thanks a lot guys, and I am going to work on myself and get myself back on track. Thanks guys!!","Dude, are you me? I'm sitting here on my 23rd birthday feeling exactly like you describe for the past year. I'm trying to make small changes in my life but nothing ever sticks. Do you want to team up and help each other build a plan that gets us out of this mess?","Lots of people who tried ""figuring out"" their depression now lie in the graveyard. You obviously know nothing about mental health problems. OP is trying to figure things out by asking for advice on *how* to get better, and you can't even come up with one simple suggestion lol.

OP, Psych2Go and BetterThanYesterday YouTube channels helped me a little bit, I know what it's like to have no one to confide in and not have enough money. It's not a cure or anything, but it's better than nothing and maybe a good place to get more ideas.","Hey there! First off, you're definitely not alone in feeling this way, especially after the chaos of the past few years. It's okay to feel lost, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few steps that might help you get back on track:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one small habit to work on, like going for a 10-minute walk each day. This can help boost your mood and get you moving without feeling overwhelming.

2. **Set Simple Goals**: Instead of focusing on what you haven't achieved, set small, achievable goals. Maybe it's applying to one job a week or spending 30 minutes a day exploring different career paths online.

3. **Reconnect with Friends**: Even if they're far away, try to schedule regular calls or video chats. Social interaction can really help improve your mental health.

4. **Explore Interests**: Take some time to explore what genuinely interests you. This could be through online courses, volunteering, or even just reading about different fields.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, everyone moves at their own pace. It's easy to compare yourself to others, but your journey is unique. Celebrate small victories and be patient with yourself.

You've got this! It's all about taking one step at a time. Good luck!","Hey there - first off, you're not a loser or failure. You graduated during one of the most challenging periods in recent history, and that alone is an achievement. Many people your age are in similar situations, even if social media makes it seem otherwise.

Let's break this down into manageable steps. Start with your physical health since that affects everything else. You don't need motivation - you need routine. Pick one small thing to do daily, like a 10-minute walk. That's it. Don't worry about weight loss yet, just build that one habit.

For the career situation: Instead of viewing those qualification attempts as failures, see them as data points. They're telling you something important - maybe this isn't the right path, or maybe you need a different approach. Take a week to explore other career options. Look up ""day in the life"" videos for different professions. Sometimes seeing the actual work helps clarify what you might enjoy.

Regarding social connections: Join local groups or clubs related to any interest you have, even if it seems minor. Check Meetup or Facebook events in your area. The goal isn't to make best friends immediately, but to have regular social interactions.

Most importantly, stop comparing yourself to others. Everyone's timeline is different. Your friends' highlight reels on social media don't show their struggles and doubts.

Pick one small thing to start with today. Just one. Maybe it's that 10-minute walk, or sending one job application, or joining one local group. Tomorrow, do it again. Small steps compound over time.

You've already shown you can achieve things by graduating. Now it's time to build on that, one day at a time.","It's amazing that you're recognizing your struggles and reaching out for help - that takes a lot of courage. First, let's acknowledge that feeling lost at 22 is completely normal, and it's not uncommon for people to take time figuring out their careers and lives. It might be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks, like updating your resume, applying to a few jobs, or dedicating 30 minutes a day to self-care. 

Regarding your professional qualifications, instead of giving up, maybe try to identify what's going wrong and work on improving those areas. It could also be worth exploring different fields or industries that might be a better fit for you. As for your mental and physical health, have you considered joining online communities or finding local groups that align with your interests? This could help you meet new people and build a support network.

Remember, comparing yourself to others is unfair to yourself - everyone's journey is unique, and social media often only shows the highlights. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help. Now, it's about taking small steps towards progress, not perfection. You got this, and you can start rebuilding your life one step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's awesome that you're reaching out and ready to make a change. Turning 22 and feeling lost isn't uncommon, especially with the pandemic throwing things off. Don't beat yourself up too much about comparing yourself to others; everyone's on their own timeline.

Since you're feeling stuck, maybe try breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of focusing on the big picture of a full-time job or those qualifications, what's one tiny thing you can do today to move forward? Maybe it's updating your resume for 30 minutes, going for a 20-minute walk, or reaching out to one friend.

Regarding the qualifications, maybe take a step back and re-evaluate if they truly align with your interests and goals. If not, it's okay to explore other options. There are tons of free online courses and resources to learn new skills or discover different career paths.

For your mental and physical health, start small. A short workout, even 15 minutes, is better than nothing. Find an online workout video or just put on some music and dance. As for social interaction, try joining online communities related to your interests or hobbies. It's a low-pressure way to connect with people.

The key is to focus on progress, not perfection. Celebrate small wins and be kind to yourself. You've got this!

t3_t207sh,"[Need Advice] My wife divorced me because of my porn addiction, PIED and depression. I need your help."," Hello there,

Threw away account. If I'm posting in the wrong sub please guide me where to post it.I live in a big mess now. There are many things in my life that needs my attention. I want to tell my story which I hesitated many times to write.

As I said I'm a 40 years old man. I got married 7 years ago from the kindest and most beautiful woman I ever saw. I never had any relations before marriage. Just after marriage, I discovered that I have erectile dysfunction. No body knows why. I'm on the overweight side so Endocrinologists said that I need to loose weight to optimize my hormonal profile. My psychiatrists talked about watching porn and porn induced erectile dysfunction. Urologists don't have answers, for them I should proceed for implant surgery which other doctors are refusing since I'm not completely flaccid. Not before I solve my porn addiction and overweight problem.

I tried hard loosing weight staying away from porn but everytime I fail, I get depressed and I become worse than before. I know some people my consider this nonesense but I always had problems with my self confidence and social anxiety. That was the final blow. Eventually my wife left me. that was 1 year ago. My depression starting reflecting on my behaviuor with her. I started treating her badly but i never hit her before you jump to conclusions. Although by the time she left me, I already had started seeing psychiatrists but she couldn't take it anymore. I love her so much. I want her back. She never did me any harm and I treated her badly. I want to fix myself but I don't know if I can do it or no.

I need to become athletic to correct all my hormones which I never did in my life even as a kid I wasn't active. I was a bookworm then a geek but never an active person. I need to stop watching porn which is the only thing now that gives me any kind of joy. I want to loose weight which increased dramatically since she left me. I need to take my medications again. After this I need to have the courage to accept that i may need a surgery after all this effort.

I live alone in another country that my motherland. I have a successful career in this country. Although I'm not happy with it and every day I think about quitting and returning home but I try to do my best since it's the only thing left. No body of my colleagues understands what i'm going through. No body will even if I told them. Multiple nationalities working togehter so it's not the mosr friendly atmosphere. My psychiatrist is saying that quitting my job will be like committing suicide. I live alone. No family, no relatives nearby and only two friends that I'm very ashamed to tell them the truth. Even if I tell them, each has his own world and problems nowadays.

I need to be able to cook myself daily healthy meals. I need to exercise, loose weight and become a real athletic. I need to clean the house. Since my depression worsened my personal hygiene level has detriorated dramatically. I need also to study hard for an exam that I've been failing each year for the last 3 years. I need to quit watching porn. I need to quit staying glued to my phone screen for long hours. The older I get, the harder it gets to achieve anything.My work routine isn't regular which is another problem. I wake up at 5:30 am everyday. sometimes I go home by 3:00 pm, sometimes 7:00 pm and sometimes I spend a full 24 hours working (really 24h). No rules.

I don't know what I'm asking for. Am I searching for motivation? Or searching for someone to tell me that's impossible and stop trying. am i just venting, I don't know. All I know that reddit helped me several times in different situatiuons. I need your help again.","Your situation is not impossible and in a years time you can be a totally different, happier, healthier, better version of yourself.

Firstly I think it’s important to acknowledge you may never get your wife back. And I think trying to make these changes as a means of getting her back is a complete waste of time. Not only does this disrespect her autonomy, but you may not deserve to have her forgiveness based on the way you’ve treated her. 

I would look at this as a journey to self actualization; and if there are good things that come of it then great. It took your wife leaving and you being SO unhappy that you have to make a change. Please don’t think that this level of motivation is going to exist forever.

To be quite frank I would be surprised if you were able to do this on your own. I certainly wouldn’t try as my first option.

Get a group of people dedicated to you, on your team, and working together to assist you.

* A personal trainer 2-3x per week 
* A nutritionist or a meal-planning service
* A therapist who specializes in addiction 
* A therapist who specializes in CBT/Self esteem 
* Change your phone to a non-smart-phone
* Shut off your internet at home
* Get out of the house and join social things like meetup or other events 
* Start journaling and picturing the life you want to live and the person you want to be and break that down into actionable steps to get there 

You said you are successful in your career; so dedicate this to yourself and your improvement. You deserve to live a happy and healthy and fulfilled life.","Meditate, have a morning and night  routine, start losing weight slowly, walk an hour a day (no music, just self-reflect) do this for 3 weeks then try if there's something changing in you.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. First off, remember that change is a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Start by focusing on one or two areas that you feel you can tackle first. For instance, try setting a simple goal like going for a 10-minute walk each day. This can help with both weight loss and mental health. As for cooking, maybe start with easy, healthy recipes that don't require much time or effort. 

Regarding your porn addiction, consider seeking support from online communities or therapy groups that specialize in this area. It can be really helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through. 

Also, don't be too hard on yourself about your work situation. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but try to find small moments of joy or relaxation in your day. And remember, it's okay to reach out to your friends. You might be surprised at how supportive they can be. 

Lastly, keep in touch with your psychiatrist and follow their advice. You're not alone in this, and taking these small steps can lead to bigger changes over time. You've got this!","First, know that you're not alone in dealing with multiple challenges at once. Many people have rebuilt their lives from similar situations - it's difficult but absolutely possible.

Let's focus on small, manageable steps rather than trying to fix everything at once. Start with these three fundamental areas:

1. Basic self-care: Set a simple morning routine. Shower daily, brush teeth, make your bed. These small wins build momentum and help combat depression. They're your foundation.

2. Physical health: Start walking 15 minutes daily, no matter what. Just 15 minutes. When that becomes easy, gradually increase it. For nutrition, begin by preparing just one healthy meal per day. Master that before adding more.

3. Porn addiction: Check out r/pornfree for specialized support. Install website blockers and find a replacement activity for when urges hit - even if it's just going for a walk or doing pushups.

For your irregular work schedule, create different versions of your daily routine - one for regular days, one for long shifts, etc. The key is having a plan for each scenario.

Don't worry about becoming ""athletic"" right now. Focus on building basic healthy habits first. The rest will follow naturally.

Regarding your career - your psychiatrist is right. Keep your job for now. It provides structure and stability while you work on yourself.

Remember: progress isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, and that's normal. The key is to get back on track immediately after a slip-up, no matter how small.

Start today. Right now. Take a shower, make your bed, go for a 15-minute walk. Then come back tomorrow and do it again. That's how rebuilding begins.","It takes a lot of courage to share your story, and I appreciate your honesty. It's clear that you're facing a complex set of challenges, but it's great that you're acknowledging them and seeking help. 

Firstly, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the big picture, focus on making progress one step at a time. For example, start with small changes to your daily routine, like cooking healthy meals or exercising for 10-15 minutes each day. As you achieve these small wins, you'll build momentum and confidence.

It's also essential to address your porn addiction and depression simultaneously. Consider seeking professional help from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide support as you work towards recovery.

Given your irregular work schedule, it might be helpful to create a flexible routine that adapts to your changing work hours. Use a planner or app to stay organized and prioritize your tasks, including time for self-care and relaxation.

Remember that rebuilding your life takes time, effort, and patience. It's not impossible, but it will require dedication and perseverance. You've already taken the first step by sharing your story and seeking help. Now, focus on making progress, no matter how small, and celebrate your successes along the way.

As for your wife, it's understandable that you want her back, but it's crucial to focus on your personal growth and development first. Work on becoming a better version of yourself, and then you can reassess your relationship and consider reaching out to her in the future.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself, and try to reframe your mindset around your struggles. Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes, focus on what you can do differently moving forward. You've got this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't give up on yourself.","Hey man, that sounds like a really tough situation, and it takes courage to lay it all out like that. It's definitely not impossible to turn things around, but you're right, it can feel overwhelming when you look at the whole picture.

Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Pick *one* thing to focus on this week. Since your health is a big concern, maybe that's cooking one healthy meal a day, even if it's just a simple salad or grilled chicken. Or commit to a 15-minute walk each day. Small wins can build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.

For the porn addiction, try setting small goals there too. Maybe start by limiting your usage by 30 minutes each day. Find something else to fill that time, even if it's just reading a book or listening to music. There are also a lot of resources online and support groups that can help with addiction.

As for your job, maybe explore options for a less demanding role within the company or start looking for something different. It doesn't have to be a drastic change right away, but having a plan can ease some of the stress.

Don't be afraid to lean on your psychiatrist and be honest about how you're feeling. They're there to help you navigate this. And maybe consider reaching out to those two friends, even if you're ashamed. True friends will understand and offer support, even if they're busy with their own lives.

You've got this. Just take it one step at a time, and be kind to yourself along the way. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

t3_xt8obp,[Need Advice] Struggling to forgive myself after wasting academic time,"I took 4 years off after high school because I knew for a fact I didn't know what I wanted to do and I had a feeling I wasn't mature enough to take college/internships/network as seriously as I should. I'm now 22 and feel so behind everyone else and feel like a failure for taking time off. I'm just now starting college this upcoming semester and probably won't graduate until I'm nearly 26, unless I can find a way to manage extra credit hours while working. How can I stop focusing on the past and comparing myself to other people my age who have already completed their degrees?","Wish this was the top comment. This is the most important thing in the world. Shame and guilt will not help you, moving forward and taking action will. Obviously mental health is important, work through your guilt and shame, but never let it paralyze you.",I’m 42 and going back to school next month to finish an undergraduate degree in psychology. It’s never too late.,"Hey, first off, it's great that you're taking the step to start college now. Remember, everyone's path is different, and taking time to figure out what you want is actually a smart move. Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Focus on Your Journey**: It's easy to compare yourself to others, but try to focus on your own progress. You're starting college with more life experience, which can be a huge advantage. 

2. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your college journey into smaller, manageable goals. This can help you stay motivated and give you a sense of accomplishment as you achieve each one.

3. **Time Management**: Since you're considering extra credit hours, time management will be key. Use tools like planners or apps to keep track of assignments and deadlines. Prioritize tasks and set aside specific times for studying and working.

4. **Forgive Yourself**: It's important to let go of the past. You made the best decision for yourself at the time, and now you're moving forward. Be kind to yourself and recognize that it's never too late to pursue your goals.

5. **Connect with Others**: Try to build a support network with classmates or join study groups. Having people to share the journey with can make it more enjoyable and less isolating.

Remember, success isn't a race. You're doing what's right for you, and that's what matters most. Good luck with your studies!","Taking time to figure yourself out was actually a mature and responsible choice. Many people rush into college right after high school because it's ""what you're supposed to do"" - then end up changing majors multiple times or dropping out entirely. You saved yourself both time and money by waiting until you felt ready.

Your timeline is completely valid. Life isn't a race, and there's no universal schedule you need to follow. At 26, you'll have your degree AND four years of real-world experience that your peers won't have. That perspective and maturity will likely help you get more out of your education and make better career decisions.

Instead of viewing the past as wasted time, try reframing it as preparation time. Focus on what you can control now: crushing your classes, building relationships with professors, and pursuing internships. Your age can actually be an advantage - professors and employers often appreciate older students who bring more focus and life experience to the table.

Remember that success stories come in all shapes and sizes. Colonel Sanders started KFC at 65. Vera Wang began designing at 40. Your path is uniquely yours, and that's perfectly okay. Channel your energy into making the most of your college experience rather than dwelling on when you started it.","It's great that you're recognizing the pattern of self-criticism and comparison that's holding you back. One thing that might help is to reframe your time off as a deliberate choice, rather than a waste. You took those four years to figure out what you wanted and to mature - that takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. Now, you're starting college with a clearer sense of purpose, which can actually be a huge advantage. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own goals and progress. Set specific, achievable targets for yourself, like completing a certain number of credits per semester or landing a part-time job in your field. Celebrate your small wins along the way, and remind yourself that everyone's path is different. You might also find it helpful to talk to a counselor or academic advisor about your feelings - they can offer valuable guidance and support as you navigate this new chapter. Remember, it's not about being ""behind"" or ""ahead"" - it's about making progress towards your own goals, at your own pace.","Hey, it's totally understandable to feel that way when you're starting something new and looking back at what others have achieved. But seriously, 22 is still super young, and you made a conscious decision to take time off and figure things out. That shows maturity, not the opposite!

Instead of focusing on the ""what ifs,"" try shifting your perspective to the ""what nows."" You're starting college with a clearer head and probably a better idea of what you want, which is a huge advantage.

To stop the comparison game, try setting really specific, achievable goals for *yourself* each week. Like, ""Attend all my Monday classes"" or ""Study for 2 hours on Tuesday evening."" Small wins build momentum and confidence. Also, consider limiting your social media time if you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to others there.

As for managing extra credit hours while working, start slow. Don't overload yourself right away. See how you handle your initial course load and work schedule, then gradually add more if you feel you can handle it. Time management is key – try using a planner or app to schedule everything, including study time, work, and downtime.

You've got this! Focus on your own journey and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. You're not behind; you're just on your own timeline.

t3_w8lmqp,[Need advice] How to clean my house properly and keep it clean all the time?,"This is embarrassing tbh because it’s considered to be an easy task for most people. I (29F) have always neglected my house. It looks like pile of trash and clothes everywhere. I’ve tried to see YouTube videos, googled etc, but I just can’t clean properly. I don’t know why I’m like this. I can’t even have guests. I can’t understand why I’m like this.

I know people think I’m just lazy but I’m not. I work, study and take long hikes very often. It’s difficult to describe the feeling I get when I think about cleaning my home. I feel defeated.","You're like that because no one has taught you how to clean. We aren't born knowing how to be tidy, we have to learn, so that's not your fault at all. Once you clean your house, It's mostly about maintaining that level through routines. I recommend unf*ck your habitat and the flylady for some simple routine building. 
To get the house where it can be managed though, you may want to enlist some help if it's really bad. But the amount you have is finite. Can you grab a trash bag, set a 5 min timer, and fill it with visible trash? You can start by sorting laundry into one place (can be a big corner pile even) to do a load a day until it's done, and a bag of trash on a timer a day. It didn't get messy all in one day, so you won't get it clean that fast either. But by taking small steps it can get better faster than you think. Good luck!","You seriously just described my exact situation. I feel overwhelmed with 3 generations worth of stuff, and I also feel like I need to sell everything I'm able to because I could use the money. But it is so damn overwhelming to even think about throwing away or donating, much less selling. I get so stressed I end up doing nothing, and am miserable every day due to all this stuff taking up my space. It's insanity","Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself—cleaning can be overwhelming, especially when you're juggling work, studies, and other activities. Here’s a simple approach that might help:

Start small. Pick one area or room to focus on, like your bedroom or living room. Set a timer for 15-20 minutes and do what you can in that time. This makes it less daunting and helps build momentum. Once you see progress in one area, it can motivate you to tackle others.

Create a routine. Try to incorporate a few minutes of tidying up into your daily schedule. For example, spend 5 minutes each morning making your bed or clearing surfaces. Consistency is key, and over time, these small habits can make a big difference.

Consider a decluttering session. Sometimes, having too much stuff can make cleaning feel impossible. Go through your things and decide what you really need or love. Donate or discard the rest. Less clutter means less to clean.

Lastly, don't hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's a friend or a professional cleaner, sometimes a little assistance can make a huge difference and teach you new strategies.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got this!","Hey there - first off, you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Cleaning can feel really overwhelming when things have piled up, but it's absolutely something you can tackle with the right approach.

Start by breaking it down into small, manageable chunks. Pick one area - like your coffee table or a single counter - and just focus on that. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see what you can get done in that time. When the timer goes off, you can stop if you want to. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue, but knowing you *can* stop makes it less daunting.

For maintaining cleanliness, the ""two-minute rule"" is super helpful: if something takes less than two minutes (putting clothes in the hamper, washing a dish right after using it), do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from building up into overwhelming piles.

A simple daily routine can make a huge difference:
Morning: Make your bed, put away dishes from the dish rack
Evening: 15-minute cleanup, wipe kitchen counters, quick sweep

Don't aim for perfection - aim for ""better than yesterday."" Some days you might only manage one small task, and that's okay. It's still progress.

Consider getting a few basic organizing tools like storage bins or a hamper for each room. Having designated spots for things makes it easier to maintain order.

Remember: You're not ""lazy"" - you're learning a new skill set. Just like hiking, it takes practice to build up your cleaning habits. Start small, be consistent, and you'll get there.","It's great that you're acknowledging the issue and wanting to make a change - that's the first step to developing discipline in any area of your life, including cleaning. One strategy that might help is to break down the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire house, try focusing on one room or area at a time. Set a specific goal, like cleaning the kitchen counters or doing a load of laundry, and give yourself a deadline to complete it. This can help build momentum and make the task less daunting. Additionally, consider creating a routine or schedule for cleaning, so it becomes a regular habit rather than something you have to think about constantly. You might also find it helpful to identify the specific feelings or thoughts that hold you back from cleaning - is it the physical effort, the decision fatigue of figuring out where to start, or something else? Once you understand what's holding you back, you can start working on strategies to overcome those obstacles. Remember, developing new habits and discipline takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't give up.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of being overwhelmed by cleaning. It's definitely not just laziness, and it sounds like you've got a lot on your plate already.

Instead of trying to do a massive clean all at once, maybe try breaking it down into super small, manageable chunks. Like, literally just focus on one drawer or one corner of a room for 15 minutes. Set a timer, and when it goes off, you're done for the day. You might be surprised how much you can accomplish in those little bursts, and it doesn't feel so daunting.

Another thing that might help is to connect cleaning to something you already enjoy. Listen to a podcast or audiobook while you tidy up. Or, reward yourself with something you like after each short cleaning session.

Also, don't be afraid to ask for help! Maybe a friend could come over and help you get started, or even just keep you company while you clean. Sometimes having someone else there can make a big difference. Good luck, you got this!

t3_uvlurd,I'm so tired of procrastination and feeling like shit [Discussion] [Need Advice],"So I have been a procrastinator since I was 9 and I'm currently 18 (F). Every time I have a project or homework to complete, I always waste time until the evening or night before to start. I then over-stress myself and panic as I pull an all-nighter and take 2 hours of sleep then wake up at 3am in attempt to finish it. Sometime I just feel like my life will lead to nowhere successful and I'm a mess. Not only do I procrastinate with my academics, but I also struggle to get things done around home in my daily life. I would procrastinate with my laundry, repainting my room, cleaning my room, learning something new, completing a non-school project, etc. I feel so helpless and annoyed with myself sometimes. Finals is coming up next week and I still haven't gotten things done.

&#x200B;

Edit: I will go into further details in this edit.

Some comments have asked me what are the reasons I procrastinate. Shamefully, I have to admit that spending time on the internet contributes to me wasting a lot of my time. Most of the time, I simply don't feel like working on my tasks, and instead I turn to anything else besides working on my deadlines. I would rather watch youtube, browse reddit, read novels, play games, play guitar, sleep, binge eat, etc. instead of doing what I should be doing. I do believe that having internet connection and my own personal devices aggravated this condition.

I stated in the beginning that I have been a terrible procrastinator since primary school, and it was because I never did homework. My single parent father migrated to this country when I was 4. He barely speaks English and is hardly literate in the language. My father was also too busy during the day earning income for the household. Since Grade 1 in primary school, I would have missing assignments and homework because unlike other pupils, I did not receive any help from my parents on my school work. If it was homework assigned in the workbooks, I was able to complete them at home. However, if there were assignments that required crafts or cardboard/poster creation, I would have nothing submitted at school, which resulted in no marks for that part.

Other than that, I was incredibly creative. I used to hand-sew tiny clothes for dolls, build miniature furniture and make small food models out of paper. I was also passionate about drawing, writing stories and creating comics. Between Grade 1-2 my average performance score was %75, Grade 3-5 %87, and during Grade 6 I averaged 91% which lead to my admission into a highly ranked secondary school in the country. However, that was only the beginning to my downfall as what I was used to previously did not apply to secondary school. As I gradually adapted to the changes, I was still struggling and performed very mediocre.

I believe I fell apart when a lot of at-home research was involved for assignments and homework. I was so used to focusing well in class, excelling in test papers and getting good final scores. Then when I'm home, I was used to having all the time to myself. In the case for secondary school, a lot of projects, researches and homework were involved for coursework scores. Besides, if you didn't do your research at home, you were likely not going to understand what was discussed in class by the teacher.

Between ages 9-14, I had Sunday classes where I would learn our native language (my father and I). During this time, I developed a bad habit of stacking the entire week's worth of homework over to Saturday, which I would rush to finish for the next day. I used to waste time until around 4-6pm to start my work which lasted up to 12 a.m on Saturday.

I genuinely believe that I enjoy learning in classes, but I hated doing extra work at home. I do not get the feeling of doing research and homework in my home environment. I also hate having to carry the panic and guilt into every class knowing that I haven't or barely did the homework or research. Sometimes if I don't do the research, the teachers would discuss a topic and I would not be able to understand.

I must also mention that I have serious commitment issues. As for all of you that suggested I do journaling or create to-do lists etc. This is to justify why these methods don't work. I have tried many times in the past to create time schedules for tasks and journaling in a diary everyday, but what happens is that I would eventually stop very soon.

Unlike my other family members, I am used to having a messy room since I was around 8. The time I would actually clean my room is when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon rush of adrenaline to get rid of the junk in my space. That very rare and sudden adrenaline is also what I often required to pull me through some big tasks. Besides that, I'm typically just a lazy slug.","What you need are two things:

1) A mentor. 

Anyone who you can trust that can support you and help you to develop the skills you need to be able to be more productive and achieve your goals. This person can help you by giving you advice, helping you train, support you when you fail or provide the kind of influence you need to reach the level of success your mind is pushing you towards. 

2) Habits:

You need to develop habits that will propel you into the future and towards your inner self's level of expected success. Habits are best defined as small repetitive steps that lead towards an expected outcome. They are easy to start and over time, become engrained into your daily ritual to the point of subconsciousness. 

Break the mindset that your path to success is A to B. It's really A to Z. Start small. Start with easy changes that do not require a lot of effort or change who you are overnight. Build from there. Find the inner developmental triggers that work for you by expirimenting and learning about who you are as an individual. This skill will help you to direct yourself towards change and ultimately, success. 

Understand the value in trial and error. Failure is a gift that leads to success. 

You can do this. You have the fire within you. Remember, the longest journey starts with a single step.","Yes yes yes! I’ve always been a serial procrastinator. I’ve spent my 20’s trying out different methods, and asking others for their strategies that help. I’ve found some that work well for me, and some that haven’t. That’s ok, and I can’t expect it to suddenly change overnight. It’s something I will continue to work on and test. 

I break tasks into teeny tiny chunks (as small as you can go!) so you only commit to a little thing (much easier than a huge task!), get it done quickly and feel good about yourself and your achievements (which motivates you to do more)
I also love lists. Bright, colourful ones that look fun to me, and I can colour in tick boxes, or fill up a barometer (to track my progress and watch my successes add up)
False deadlines with accountability’s key for me. I tell my friend or family ‘I need to finish this task by this date, and I can do *this* as a reward’. Those people often don’t even need to check in on me, but the accountability to another is far more powerful than to myself. 
I also set timelines. “This research needs to be done by 10:00 on Tuesday. This paragraph needs to be done by 12:00 on Wednesday” etc. 

Keep googling, keep asking others, and start finding out your techniques to side step procrastination 👍 good luck","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Procrastination is a tough habit to break, but it's definitely possible with some small, consistent changes. 

First, try breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about an entire project, focus on just the first step. This can make starting feel less overwhelming. Also, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes to work on something. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, you'll find it easier to keep going.

Since the internet is a big distraction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting sites during your study time. You can also try the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make study sessions feel less daunting.

For your home tasks, try to incorporate them into your daily routine. For example, do a quick 5-minute tidy-up every day instead of waiting for that rare burst of energy. 

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to struggle, and change takes time. Celebrate small victories and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. You've got this!","Thanks for sharing your story so openly. Your situation is really common - procrastination tends to become a cycle that feeds into itself, especially when we develop the habit early on. The good news is that you're aware of it and wanting to change at 18, which gives you plenty of time to develop better habits.

From what you've described, it seems like the home environment hasn't been conducive to focused work, and you've gotten used to separating ""home time"" from ""work time."" A practical solution would be to find a different physical space to do your work - like a library, study room, or quiet café. This creates a mental separation and can help break the association between home and procrastination.

For the immediate term with finals coming up, try the ""Pomodoro Technique"" - work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Start with just ONE 25-minute session. Don't think about the whole project, just commit to those 25 minutes. Most people find that getting started is the hardest part, but once you begin, it's easier to continue.

For the longer term, start building what I call ""small wins."" Instead of trying to change everything at once, pick ONE small task - like doing laundry on a specific day of the week. Make it ridiculously easy to achieve. Once that becomes routine (which might take a few weeks), add another small habit.

The internet is clearly a major distraction for you. Try using website blockers during your study sessions. Forest is a good app that gamifies staying off your phone. You could also try the ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach - physically put your phone in another room while studying.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about being consistent. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.","It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with procrastination, and I appreciate your honesty. Given your history and the factors that contribute to your procrastination, it's clear that this is a deeply ingrained habit that will take time and effort to change. 

Firstly, acknowledging that you enjoy learning in classes but struggle with homework and research at home is a crucial insight. It might be helpful to explore ways to make your home study environment more conducive to productivity. This could be as simple as dedicating a specific area for studying, free from distractions like your bed or gaming console.

Since you've mentioned that traditional methods like journaling or creating to-do lists haven't worked for you due to commitment issues, let's consider an alternative approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, start with small, manageable goals. For example, commit to working on a task for just 10-15 minutes without any distractions. After this short period, take a brief break before returning to the task. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help build momentum and make tasks less overwhelming.

It's also important to address your internet usage, as you've identified it as a significant contributor to your procrastination. Consider implementing website blockers or apps that help you stay focused on your tasks during certain periods of the day.

Given that finals are approaching, let's focus on creating a plan for the next week. Break down your study material into smaller chunks, and allocate specific times for reviewing each subject. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible, but don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – simply acknowledge the setback and get back on track.

Lastly, remember that developing discipline and overcoming procrastination is a journey. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. You've already taken a significant step by sharing your struggles and seeking help, so keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step each day.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Procrastination is a tough cycle to break, but it's definitely possible. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a long time, and you've got a good understanding of why it's happening.

First off, don't beat yourself up too much. You're aware of the problem, and that's the first step. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can actually make procrastination worse.

Since you mentioned internet distractions, maybe try some strategies to minimize those. Could you use website blockers or apps that limit your time on certain sites while you're trying to work? Even just putting your phone in another room can make a difference.

You also mentioned that you don't like doing extra work at home. Have you considered changing your environment? Maybe try working at a library, coffee shop, or even just a different room in your house. A change of scenery can sometimes help with focus.

Since you have commitment issues with journaling and to-do lists, maybe try a different approach. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, start with one small, manageable task each day. Something like ""work on homework for 15 minutes"" or ""clean one small area of my room."" The key is to make it so easy that you can't say no. Once you've built up some momentum, you can gradually increase the time or complexity of the tasks.

Also, remember to be kind to yourself. When you do procrastinate (and you will sometimes), don't use it as an excuse to give up entirely. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track as soon as you can. You've got this!

t3_1264dcn,"[NEED ADVICE] When I travel, I feel a strong urge to go home and work on my projects. When I'm actually at home, I just hesitate. anyone else?","When I'm not home, I'm wasting my time and I feel strongly that I should go home and do something productive, like working on a project. It's a shame I'm here because I'm always busy and not involved in what I do.

&#x200B;

But when I actually got home, those feelings were blown away and I was just hesitating.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had this experience? ","Yes and no.

When I’m travelling, especially when stuck driving for long hours or the entire day just to get somewhere, all my brain can think about is What We *Could* Be Doing If We Were At Home. 

If I dwell on that, it’s overwhelming and ruins the entire trip. 

So, I try and utilise my notes app on my phone, and all of these Things That I Could Be Doing I write down and assure myself we will go over them when we get home (by “we” I mean myself and the urge to do these things lol). 

Whenever I get home, I first have to deal with massive waves of intense aggression and frustration. I’ve been like this since I can remember, only difference now is I have tools to help vent the frustration instead of just blowing up at everyone. 

But I also utilise this Frustration Time to my advantage — I open up my computer and set up my To Do word document, and get my phone out and set it up so I can type up things from the notes app straight into my computer. Then, when I’m pacing around hunting for something to do to calm me, everything is already set up to go on my desk. 

So I make it as inviting as possible to just sit down and start typing up these notes of All The Things I wanted to do. 

After awhile of typing up, and seeing how many of the things I wrote in the notes while I was travelling *were already written down on my computer ages ago and forgotten about*, the problem solving gears start ticking in my brain, and I start looking for which of these To Dos I can cross off **today**. 
Before long I’ve just spent several hours working on a To Do plan and my brain is in overdrive thinking about how it can achieve those things. Then it’s just a matter of actually getting up, and like with the computer and the notes - setting up a task so that everything is ready to just *go*. 
You need to tidy that bookshelf? Pull everything off the bookshelf onto the floor. Organize the books from the decorations from the video games. Now you’re already halfway there and your brain is probably already getting excited thinking about how it can better arrange the bookcase. 

***

If you can’t get into that headspace at all when you get home, try wandering around your house doing random tiny jobs. Wipe that bench down, put that thing in the bin, put your dirty clothes from your travels into the wash. 
If your brain is anything like mine, it’ll start seeing all these other things it could be doing, and it’ll direct itself to them once you start.","this is my every single day, it's me and my adhd fighting really hard","It sounds like you're experiencing a common issue where the idea of working on projects feels more appealing when you're away from home. One thing that might help is setting up a dedicated workspace at home that you associate only with productivity. When you get home, try to spend just 5-10 minutes in that space working on something small. Often, starting is the hardest part, and once you get going, it becomes easier to continue. Also, consider setting specific goals or deadlines for your projects to give yourself a sense of urgency and purpose. Remember, it's all about building the habit gradually. Good luck!","This is a really common pattern - it's basically the ""grass is greener"" effect combined with zero friction when daydreaming about work versus actual friction when trying to do it. When you're away, it's easy to imagine yourself being productive because you're not faced with the reality of getting started.

What helps break this cycle is creating a super specific, minimal startup routine for when you get home. Something like ""I'll sit at my desk and open the project files for just 5 minutes."" Make it so small it feels ridiculous to not do it. The key is removing the pressure of feeling like you need to dive into hours of focused work.

Once you're actually in front of your work with no pressure, you'll often find yourself naturally wanting to continue. And if not, that's fine too - you still built the habit of showing up, which is what matters most for long-term consistency.

Try it this week: Next time you get home, immediately do your micro-routine before anything else. Don't worry about how long you work after that. Just build that initial bridge between thinking about working and actually starting.","I think I can relate to what you're going through. It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of ""grass is always greener"" syndrome, where being away from home makes you feel like you're missing out on productivity, but when you're actually at home, other distractions or comfort zone habits kick in and hinder your motivation. One strategy that might help is to set clear goals and schedules for both your travel and home time, so you can make the most of each environment. For example, you could dedicate specific times during your trip to relaxation and exploration, and then schedule focused work sessions when you return home. Additionally, try to identify what specifically triggers your hesitation at home - is it procrastination, lack of accountability, or something else? Once you understand the root cause, you can develop targeted strategies to overcome it and make progress on your projects, regardless of where you are.","Hey, that's a pretty common feeling! It sounds like the *idea* of working on your projects is more appealing than the actual work itself. When you're away, you're romanticizing the productivity you *could* be having.

Here's a thought: try breaking down your projects into super small, manageable steps. Like, instead of ""work on project X,"" make it ""write one paragraph for project X"" or ""spend 15 minutes researching project Y."" When you get home, pick *one* of those tiny tasks and commit to doing just that. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've done that small thing, you'll find it easier to keep going.

Also, maybe analyze *why* you hesitate when you get home. Are you tired? Distracted? Is the project overwhelming? Identifying the roadblocks can help you find solutions. Good luck!

t3_u0cll8,[Need Advice] How do you deal with multiple interests and lack of discipline to commit to any one?,"I am a generalist and passionate about manyyy things. But this serves as a disadvantage (IMO) because to succeed, you have to be consistent and focus on one particular thing. You only have time to do so many things in life. But I am having a hard time narrowing my interests down to a single thing. If I pursue one of my interests, I feed bad for not doing something else. And also get bored if I keep doing the same thing over and over. I thrive on novelty and in this case, I love the novelty of learning something new. 

This is a typical cycle for me. I usually start off by doing something novel, put all my effort into learning the basics, get to a saturation point, and then I either get bored or feel bad for not pursuing my other interests (or sometimes both) and end up giving up on what I was doing. And this cycle keeps repeating. And to be clear, I am equally passionate about all of my interests. These are not hobbies, these are interests that I would potentially consider taking up as careers. (Which is why I have a hard time narrowing them down)

A glimpse into my interests - cooking & food YT channel, filmography, crypto, data science and statistics, productivity and biohacks (would love to create a podcast), creating an online course on a health topic, organic farming, evolutionary biology (would love to create a podcast on this too) and the list goes on....

I would love to hear some advice from this group. Had anyone else dealt with this? What are your tips to keep being consistent at one thing? Or if you have seen success in being a generalist, please share that too. 

Thanks!","I believe that someone in r/ADHD had mentioned  before that this subreddit is full of undiagnosed people with ADHD.  Which makes sense because get disciplined is basically our day to day struggle. 

OP have you ever heard the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none”? Most people with ADHD identifies with it, and feel bad because if it. However, the original goes as “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"". 

Focusing on a particular activity was probably the right thing to do before the exponential growth in technology in the past decades. Nowadays is a really risky bet, because it’s much simpler to build a algorithm that can do it far better than humans.","I copied those answers from another post.

Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  
consistency, not intensity.  
The answer is always no if you don’t ask  
Make life easier for tomorrow you.  
Worrying is pointless. If you’re worried about something you can’t do anything about, there is no point in worrying. If you’re worried about something you CAN do something about, then just do something about it and stop worrying.

Being a generalist can actually be a strength, especially in today's world where interdisciplinary skills are highly valued. Here’s a thought: instead of forcing yourself to choose just one interest, try creating a system where you can rotate between a few of them. For example, dedicate specific days or weeks to focus on one interest at a time. This way, you can dive deep enough to make progress but still keep the novelty alive by switching it up regularly.

Also, consider looking for intersections between your interests. For instance, you could start a YouTube channel that combines cooking with biohacks or create a podcast that explores the data science behind evolutionary biology. This way, you’re not abandoning any interest but rather integrating them in a way that keeps you engaged and productive.

Lastly, set small, achievable goals for each interest. This can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and maintain motivation without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, it’s okay to be a generalist and to enjoy the journey of learning across different fields. Good luck!","Having multiple interests isn't inherently a problem - many successful people are polymaths. The key is learning to manage your attention strategically rather than trying to forcefully narrow yourself down to just one thing.

Consider treating your interests like a portfolio rather than picking a single focus. You can have primary and secondary interests that get different amounts of your time and energy. This lets you maintain variety while still making meaningful progress.

Here's what's worked for others in similar situations: Pick 2-3 interests to be your ""core"" focuses for the next 3-6 months. Give these the majority of your learning time. The others can be ""background"" interests you engage with more casually. After the time period, re-evaluate and adjust which interests are primary.

For example, you could focus primarily on data science and the health podcast for the next few months, while keeping cooking as a casual weekend activity. This creates structure while preserving the novelty you enjoy.

To maintain consistency, try:
- Setting specific project milestones for your primary interests
- Scheduling dedicated time blocks for focused work
- Finding ways to combine interests (like using data science to analyze cooking trends)
- Building accountability through sharing your progress
- Celebrating small wins to maintain momentum

Remember that careers rarely require purely singular focus. Many successful people combine multiple interests - like a data scientist who does science communication through podcasting. Your variety of interests could become your unique value proposition rather than a limitation.

The goal isn't to eliminate your natural curiosity, but to channel it productively. Start with small commitments to your chosen primary interests and build from there.","I totally understand where you're coming from - it can be tough to narrow down your interests when you're passionate about so many things. One strategy that might help is to think about the common threads that run through your various interests. For example, you mentioned cooking, filmography, and creating online courses - could you combine these interests by creating a YouTube channel or podcast that focuses on food and health, and incorporates elements of storytelling and visual production? By finding ways to overlap your interests, you might be able to satisfy your desire for novelty while still making progress on a specific project. 

Another approach could be to set a ""seasonal"" goal for yourself - commit to focusing on one interest for a set period of time (e.g. 3-6 months), and then switch to another one. This would allow you to make progress on multiple interests without feeling like you're neglecting the others. It's also worth considering the idea that you don't have to choose just one career or path - many people have successful careers that involve multiple pursuits, or they pivot between different fields over time.

In terms of staying consistent, it might be helpful to set aside dedicated time for each of your interests, even if it's just a small block of time each week. This could help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed. Finally, I'd encourage you to think about what you're hoping to achieve with each of your interests - is it creative expression, financial stability, personal fulfillment? By clarifying your goals, you might be able to prioritize your interests and focus on the ones that align most closely with what you want to accomplish.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're a multi-passionate person, which is awesome, but can definitely lead to that ""shiny object syndrome"" and feeling pulled in a million directions.

Here's a thought: instead of trying to pick *one* thing forever, maybe reframe your thinking. Think of it as seasons. You could dedicate, say, 3-6 months to really diving deep into one area. Filmography for the spring, data science in the summer, etc. This gives you the novelty you crave, but also enough time to actually make progress and see results in each area.

To avoid the ""feeling bad"" part, try scheduling time for your other interests, even if it's just an hour a week for research or brainstorming. Knowing you have dedicated time for them can ease the FOMO.

Also, consider how your interests might overlap. Could you use data science to analyze trends in film, or create a cooking show that incorporates evolutionary biology? Finding those connections can make your pursuits feel less scattered and more synergistic.

Finally, remember that ""success"" doesn't always mean becoming a world-renowned expert. It can also mean learning a lot, having fun, and expanding your horizons. Good luck!

t3_qp2iwf,"[Need Advice] 15 year old, 0 friends, 0 hobbies, almost never going outside, bad social skills, social anxiety.","I hate my life. I am 15 and i have 0 friends. When i was younger i had a lot of friends, until video games came into my life. They looked so fun and instead of hanging out with friends i played games instead and thats the reason why i didnt made any friends for my future. Right now i only have some friends at school, but our friendship is only there. I cant make any new friends because i am super scared to make first move and i think that they will laugh at me.

Another problem is that my social skills are just awful. That's probably because i don't go out almost at all, not even to a shop. And i also have a social anxiety and i always think that people are looking at me and judging me (im even scared of my family members opinion!) and because of this i am scared to do normal things like nose blowing in public

My problems doesnt end there. I almost have no normal hobbies. I would love to be good at sports but im super bad and always trashtalked there because im clumsy and my coordination is bad. 

Im also thinking about starting gym but i am scared of what others will think about me and so on.

I need advice, how can i change my life because right now it is awful.

Edit: didnt expect this to blow up, thank you all for the tips.",My best advice is to do volunteer work. it is so much easier to learn how to interact with people when you are helping someone who needs help. There are countless organizations that need volunteers and all sorts of different roles available for volunteers.,,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make some changes. That's a big step in itself. Let's break this down a bit. 

For making friends, start small. You mentioned you have some school friends—try to engage with them a bit more. Maybe ask if they want to hang out after school or join a club together. It doesn't have to be a big group; even one or two close friends can make a huge difference.

Improving social skills takes practice, and it's okay to start slow. Try small interactions, like saying ""hi"" to someone new or making small talk with a classmate. It might feel awkward at first, but it gets easier with time. Remember, most people are focused on themselves and not judging you as much as you think.

As for hobbies, it's awesome that you're considering the gym. Everyone starts somewhere, and most people at the gym are focused on their own workouts. Maybe start with some home workouts to build confidence, or find a beginner class where everyone is learning together. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","Hey there - first off, you're incredibly self-aware for 15, and recognizing these patterns now puts you in a great position to make positive changes. Let me share some practical steps you can take.

Start small with the social anxiety. Instead of jumping straight into making friends, practice basic social interactions. Go to the local store and buy something small. Just say ""hi"" and ""thanks"" to the cashier. Do this a few times a week. It's like training a muscle - you build it up gradually.

For the gym worry - everyone starts somewhere, and most people are too focused on their own workout to pay attention to others. Try going during off-peak hours when it's quieter. Many gyms offer a free session with a trainer who can show you proper form and help you get comfortable with the equipment.

About sports - coordination and skill come with practice. You could start by practicing basic movements at home where no one's watching. Try something like jump rope or following basic workout videos on YouTube. Once you feel more confident, look into individual sports like swimming or running where you compete mainly against yourself.

The gaming habit isn't inherently bad, but try setting specific time limits. Use the extra time to develop one new hobby. Just one. Pick something you can do solo at first - drawing, reading, learning an instrument, coding - whatever interests you. The goal is to build confidence through competence.

Remember that your current situation is temporary. You're at an age where everything feels intense and permanent, but you have so much time to grow and change. Take one small step each day, and in a few months, you'll be surprised at how far you've come.","Hey, I totally get why you'd feel that way about your life right now. It's tough to break out of a cycle like that, but the fact that you're recognizing these issues and wanting to change is a huge step forward. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one area you'd like to improve, like going outside more or developing a hobby. For example, you could try taking short walks around your neighborhood or doing some light exercise at home to get comfortable with the idea of being active. As for social skills and making friends, it might be helpful to start with small, low-stakes interactions, like chatting with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. It's also worth considering joining a club or group that focuses on something you're interested in, so you can meet people who share your passions. And don't worry too much about what others think - most people are too caught up in their own lives to be judging you as harshly as you think. Remember that it's okay to start slow and make mistakes - the important thing is that you're taking steps towards changing your life for the better.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're recognizing it and wanting to change is a huge first step. It's awesome you're reaching out.

First off, about the friends thing: don't beat yourself up about the video games. It's easy to get caught up in them. The key now is to slowly start re-engaging. Since you have some school friends, maybe try suggesting a low-pressure activity, like grabbing a quick bite after school or studying together. Baby steps!

Social anxiety is a beast, but it's manageable. A good starting point is challenging those negative thoughts. When you think people are judging you, ask yourself if there's actual evidence of that, or if it's just your anxiety talking. It's also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor at school – they can give you tools to manage the anxiety.

As for hobbies, don't worry about being ""good"" at sports right away. The point is to have fun and be active. Maybe try individual sports like running, swimming, or cycling where you can focus on your own progress. Or, look for beginner-friendly sports clubs or recreational leagues where the emphasis is on learning and having fun, not winning.

The gym is a great idea! Everyone starts somewhere, and most people are way more focused on their own workout than on judging others. Maybe go with a friend (even a school friend!) for the first few times, or consider hiring a trainer for a session or two to get comfortable with the equipment and form.

The most important thing is to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and there will be setbacks. Celebrate small victories, and don't give up. You got this!

t3_p89z6k,[Need Advice] Why do I find myself going on social media overdrive after a long hard day of work?,"After completing 16 solid hours of productive analytical work, instead of hitting the sack, I go into manic scrolling mode.. Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Reddit, becoming increasingly awake and energetic till 2am, effectively ruining my next day. 

Why is this happening ? How can I stop this?

Update: Thank you for insightful comments and great recommendations! I am super grateful for the effort that you guys have put in your replies. I’ve learnt new perspectives from every single comment. This is awesome. Thank you once again 🥰

To summarize 

1) Go on dopamine fasting. Rewire my brain to get used to lower doses of dopamine hit. Swear off social media

2) Replace downtime with something constructive, that I can grow over time. Be deliberate about what the replacement activities are before going on dopamine fast. Examples of replacement activities are reading, journaling, exercising, learning a new language, trying to make art…

3) Examine what is causing me to get into social media apps, beyond the dopamine factor. Social media is not my support network. Few books mentioned are Wilpower instinct, Atomic habits, Digital Minimization, the Molecule of more 

4) Out of sight out of mind. Keep the phone away, set limits on usage, put on grey mode, tell my brain that I am not missing out anything. Love this quote ""If it's not what you want, are you really sacrificing anything by not doing it?""","It is called Revenge Procrastination. Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.","I’m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary ‘A Social Dilemma’. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. 

Here’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:


“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.

This feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”

Link: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/

There’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. 

As always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!","It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of needing to unwind after a long day, but the way you're doing it is actually counterproductive. After such intense work, your brain craves a break, and social media offers quick, easy dopamine hits. The problem is, it can become a cycle that disrupts your sleep and productivity. 

To break this habit, try setting a specific time limit for social media use in the evening, maybe 30 minutes, and stick to it. Use apps that can help you enforce these limits. Also, consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve screens—like reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. 

Remember, it's about finding balance. You don't have to cut out social media entirely, but being mindful of how and when you use it can make a big difference. Good luck!","What you're experiencing is a common ""revenge bedtime procrastination"" pattern. After intense analytical work, your brain is still in high-gear and craving easy stimulation - social media provides that quick hit of novelty and entertainment.

The key is creating a proper wind-down routine that helps transition your mind from work mode to rest mode. When you finish work, try setting a 30-minute timer for your social media use. Once it goes off, switch to calming activities like reading a physical book, light stretching, or journaling. The physical separation from your phone is crucial here.

You might also want to experiment with a ""shutdown ritual"" - a consistent set of actions that signal to your brain that work is done for the day. This could be as simple as writing down tomorrow's tasks, clearing your desk, and changing into comfortable clothes.

For immediate practical steps: Move your phone charger away from your bed, use app blockers after certain hours, and switch your phone to grayscale mode in the evening. Having a glass of water and doing some deep breathing exercises can help too.

Remember that those 16-hour workdays are intense - your brain needs genuine downtime to process and recover. Building in proper breaks and rest periods will actually make you more productive in the long run than pushing through and falling into the social media trap.

The fact that you're aware of this pattern and seeking to change it is already a huge step. Start with small changes to your evening routine and build from there.","It sounds like you've already gotten some great advice from the community and have a good understanding of what's driving your behavior. One thing to consider is that after 16 hours of focused work, your brain is likely craving a release and social media provides an easy outlet for that. By replacing this downtime with more constructive activities, as you mentioned, you can start to break the cycle. 

I'd like to add that it might be helpful to establish a consistent wind-down routine before bed, something that signals to your brain that it's time to relax and prepare for sleep. This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, practicing some light stretches, or reading a book. By doing so, you can start to associate the end of the workday with relaxation rather than mindless scrolling. 

It's also great that you're recognizing the importance of understanding the underlying causes of your behavior and not just treating the symptoms. Exploring books like ""Willpower Instinct"" and ""Atomic Habits"" can definitely provide valuable insights into building better habits and self-control. Keep in mind that it's a process and it might take some time to adjust, but with persistence and self-awareness, you can develop healthier habits and improve your overall well-being.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of wanting to unwind after a long day, only to find yourself sucked into the social media vortex. It's super common!

It sounds like you've already got a great handle on potential solutions from your update. Dopamine fasting and finding replacement activities are solid strategies. I'd suggest starting small. Maybe pick *one* replacement activity to focus on for a week. Trying to overhaul everything at once can be overwhelming.

Also, you mentioned examining the underlying reasons for your social media use. That's key! Are you looking for connection? Distraction? Validation? Once you pinpoint *what* you're seeking, you can find healthier ways to fulfill those needs. For example, if it's connection, maybe a quick call to a friend or family member would be more fulfilling than endless scrolling.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's a process, and you're bound to slip up. The important thing is to recognize it, learn from it, and keep moving forward. You got this!

t3_xe53ud,"[Need Advice] How to stop being extremely lazy and day dreaming, and instead focus on learning?","Hello, I am easily distracted in school. I am extremely lazy and would often day dream but I am extremely lazy.

I have short-sightedness and would just use it as an excuse to not focus, but here's the thing. 

I would write down what I heard and google it, even when my vision is blurry.

EXCEPT I STOPPED DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M REALLY LAZY, HOW DO I DEAL WITH MYSELF?","Since no one else is giving you serious advice… Learning is just like any good habit and it takes time to build good habits.  You need to force yourself to do things you don’t enjoy because you know that its for your own benefit anyway.

Force yourself to study for 10-15 minutes at a time.  Do this multiple times a day, whether you feel like it or not.

Soon the habit of studying starts to form and then you will be studying more often and it won’t seem so unpleasant after a while.

But this doesn’t happen overnight.  Building habits take time.","I'd recommend using a pomodoro timer! 25 minutes on, 5 min break.","Hey there! It sounds like you're aware of your challenges, which is a great first step. Here’s a simple approach to help you get back on track:

1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each study session. For example, aim to focus for just 10-15 minutes at a time, then take a short break. Gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable.

2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a consistent study routine. Having a set time and place for studying can help train your brain to get into ""focus mode.""

3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those. This could mean studying in a quiet place, using apps to block distracting websites, or keeping your phone out of reach.

4. **Use Your Short-Sightedness as a Tool**: Since you mentioned your vision, maybe use it to your advantage. Sit closer to the board or screen if possible, and use it as a reason to focus more intently on what's in front of you.

5. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself a small reward after completing a study session. This could be a snack, a short walk, or a few minutes of a favorite activity.

Remember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!","It sounds like you already know what works for you - taking notes and researching what you don't understand. The challenge isn't finding the right strategy, it's getting yourself to actually do it consistently.

Start small. Instead of trying to take perfect notes for every class, commit to just 10 minutes of focused note-taking per day. Set a timer on your phone if you need to. The key is making it so easy that you can't talk yourself out of it.

For the daydreaming, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique when you catch your mind wandering. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring your attention back to the present moment.

Your short-sightedness is a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. Have you talked to your teachers about sitting closer to the front? Most are happy to accommodate this kind of request. You could also record lectures (with permission) to review later when you can see your screen clearly.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small improvements consistently. Pick one tiny change to implement this week. Once that becomes routine, add another. Over time, these small wins compound into major progress.","It sounds like you're aware of your strengths, like being able to learn through listening and note-taking, but are struggling with motivation. One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle a huge study session, commit to focusing for just 10-15 minutes at a time, and then take a short break. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, try to identify what triggers your daydreaming - is it boredom, stress, or something else? Once you know what's causing it, you can develop strategies to address the root cause. It's also great that you've found ways to adapt to your short-sightedness in the past, so see if you can tap into that resourcefulness again to find ways to stay engaged and motivated. Remember, developing discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time - don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up, just acknowledge the setback and try to do better next time.","Hey, I get it, that cycle of wanting to learn but getting stuck in lazy/daydream mode is super frustrating. It sounds like you *know* what helps you (writing things down, Googling), which is a huge first step!

Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, maybe try this: pick *one* class, and commit to just doing that writing/Googling thing for *one* week. Seriously, just that one small thing. Don't worry about being perfect, just focus on that one action.

Also, about the eyesight thing – could you get your glasses updated? Even a small improvement might remove that mental hurdle. If glasses aren't enough, maybe talk to your school's disability services; they might have resources to help you focus.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Everyone struggles with motivation. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Small wins build momentum! Good luck!

t3_xjcny2,"[Need Advice] I Tried Everything, but Nothing Works. I Don't Know What to Do Any More.","Hello, I'm Male 19. I'm studying in college and I'm currently in my third semester. My exams are about to start in the second week of October and I haven't studied anything yet. Due to college being lenient on attendance, I didn't attend much lectures because of my social anxiety. I'm feeling all over the place right now.

I tried to make a schedule multiple times and stick to it, but my attempts were unsuccessful due to procrastination as well as poor time management skills, I always end up feeling overwhelmed.

Being a dopamine addict doesn't help either. I always prioritize instant gratification over my long-term goals. I'm addicted to smartphone, specifically social media like YouTube and Reddit. My screen time is 8-10 hours. I'm addicted to masturbation too.

I don't feel motivated at all. I mean obviously how I'll feel motivated when I keep overstimulating my brain with useless shit. Still, I tried. I even started seeing a therapist since the month of July for my stress, anxiety and depression, but I'm seeing no improvements so far.

I fucking hate myself. Thinking about all the time I've wasted and all the time I'm wasting right now as well as thinking about what if I was self-disciplined and how successful I would've been makes me feel like a total piece of shit. I wish I could run far away from all of my problems and disappear from this world peacefully.

What should I do? Please help me, I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed right now. Thank you.","Ok bro you are me but I’m 32, this is probably going to be a lifelong quest for you to stay motivated and productive, but if you START learning how to do it now it will pay off so much bigger.

First thing though you can’t fucking HATE yourself over it, that doesn’t actually help. It’s super emotional and it doesn’t get you anywhere, it just makes you sad and emotional which triggers your brain to look for comfort, which in your case is just more procrastination.

Don’t study for 6 hours straight “tomorrow,” study for 5 minute right this second. If you have a fitness goal, don’t wait until tomorrow where you will eat perfectly clean and start the most beautiful diet. Eat a salad today, or just don’t drink one soda.

Go very slow, progress takes time, stay calm you are going to have to make mistakes to learn, don’t get mad at yourself for mistakes. 

If you have something that you need a professional for like adhd or depression, go make that appointment and make baby steps on that too",24 and agree this is what i had to work on,"Hey there, first off, take a deep breath. It's great that you're reaching out for help, and it's a good first step. Here's a plan you might find helpful:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on small, manageable changes. For example, set a timer for 25 minutes and study during that time, then take a 5-minute break. This is known as the Pomodoro Technique and can help with focus and productivity.

2. **Limit Screen Time**: Try using apps that block social media or limit your screen time. You can gradually reduce your usage by setting specific times when you allow yourself to check your phone.

3. **Routine**: Establish a simple daily routine. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and include time for studying, meals, and relaxation. Consistency can help reduce anxiety and improve time management.

4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's easy to fall into a cycle of self-criticism, but remember that everyone struggles with discipline at some point. Acknowledge your efforts and progress, no matter how small.

5. **Therapy**: Keep up with therapy. It might take time to see improvements, but it's a valuable tool for managing anxiety and depression. Discuss your concerns with your therapist—they might adjust your approach or suggest new strategies.

6. **Reach Out**: Consider joining a study group or finding a study buddy. This can provide accountability and make studying less isolating.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!","First off - stop beating yourself up. You're 19 and dealing with a lot: college transition, anxiety, and some tough habits. That's a real challenge, but it's also completely normal and fixable. Let's break this down into manageable steps.

Start with your most immediate concern - those October exams. For the next few weeks, forget about being perfectly disciplined or fixing everything at once. Your only mission is to pass those exams. 

Here's what you can do right now:
Get a basic study outline going. What subjects do you need to cover? What's the minimum you need to learn to pass? Write this down.

For your phone addiction - install app blockers like Freedom or Forest. Don't try to quit cold turkey - instead, set specific times when you can use social media. Maybe 30 minutes in the morning and evening. The rest of the time, your phone goes in another room while you study.

For studying itself, use the Pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. No heroics needed - just sit down and do one session. Then another. The key is starting small and being consistent.

About the anxiety and therapy - therapy takes time to work, and it's good you're sticking with it. Keep going. While you're working on that, try some basic anxiety management like deep breathing or going for a walk when things feel overwhelming.

Remember: You don't need motivation to act. You just need to start, even if you don't feel like it. Take it one day at a time, one Pomodoro session at a time. Focus on small wins and build from there.

Come back here and post your progress. This community's got your back.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and it's great that you've already taken the step of seeking therapy - that takes a lot of courage. One thing to consider is that developing discipline and overcoming addiction (whether it's to your smartphone or other behaviors) is a process that takes time, and it's not something you can change overnight. 

Given your struggles with procrastination and time management, instead of trying to create a perfect schedule, try breaking down your study goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, commit to studying for just 25 minutes without any distractions, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help make studying feel less overwhelming.

It's also important to address your screen time and other addictive behaviors. You might consider implementing some website blockers or apps that track and limit your screen time, such as Freedom or SelfControl. Additionally, replacing some of your screen time with other activities, like going for a walk or reading a book, can help you feel more fulfilled and less reliant on instant gratification.

Remember that it's okay to not feel motivated all the time, and it doesn't mean you're a failure. It might be helpful to explore with your therapist why you feel the need to prioritize instant gratification over your long-term goals, and work together to develop strategies to overcome this.

Lastly, try to practice some self-compassion. Beating yourself up over past mistakes or perceived shortcomings isn't going to help you move forward. Instead, focus on what you can control in the present moment, and take things one step at a time. You've got this, and it's okay to take it slow.","Hey man, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much; a lot of people struggle with similar things, especially in college.

First, with exams coming up so soon, let's focus on damage control. Forget about feeling like you need to master everything. Pick *one* subject, break it down into the smallest possible chunks, and commit to studying just one chunk for, say, 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break). Seriously, just 25 minutes. After that, take a real break. The goal isn't perfection, it's just getting *something* done.

Regarding the phone addiction, try using app timers or website blockers. Even just putting your phone in another room while you study can make a difference. Baby steps. Maybe aim to reduce your screen time by 30 minutes each day.

It's great you're seeing a therapist, but progress isn't always linear. It takes time. Be open with them about feeling like you're not improving; they can adjust their approach.

As for the self-hate, try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what you *should* have done, focus on what you *can* do *right now*. Every small positive action is a win.

You're not a ""piece of shit."" You're a 19-year-old dealing with a lot of pressure. Start small, be kind to yourself, and focus on making tiny improvements each day. You got this.

t3_r7wiiv,[Need Advice] I am 22(F). Never had an exercise routine. I am overweight and mentally ill. Please help.,"I tried to have a routine for my whole life, but in vain. But I wanna let go of all excuses and start new with your advice. Please help me. I am good at skipping, I am flexible (did a Yoga class years ago, I was good at it).

Edit: You guys.... I am so very grateful to y'all. I started walking towards my goal today, literally. I'll be forever grateful to you ❤️","The easiest way to build a habit is to attach new behavior to an existing habit.

For example, if you want to start flossing, just put your floss next to your toothbrush so you remember to floss whenever you brush your teeth.

In your case if you want to build an exercise routine, I'd suggest start small and just find a good time to do some walking.

Watch YouTube a lot? Try to make it a habit that you only watch videos while you're walking.

Maybe put your shoes in front of your fridge so every time you go to get dinner, you remember to go on a walk afterwards.

Be creative - find a habit you can build off of and take advantage. Walking outdoors is a great way to improve mental health as well.",I always thought it was keep it simple stupid. Learnt something new.,"Starting a new routine can be challenging, but it's awesome that you're ready to take the first step! Since you mentioned you're good at skipping and have some flexibility from yoga, why not start with a mix of these? You could set a small goal, like 10 minutes of skipping and a short yoga session each day. This way, you're building on what you already enjoy and are good at. Consistency is key, so try to do it at the same time each day to make it a habit. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually increase as you feel more comfortable. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself on this journey. You've got this!","Hey there! It's fantastic that you're ready to build an exercise routine, and even better that you already know you enjoy skipping and yoga. Starting small and building on activities you actually like is the key to making habits stick.

Since you mentioned being good at yoga before, why not start there? Even 5-10 minutes each morning of simple stretches can help build that exercise habit. You could combine this with a short skipping session - maybe just 1-2 minutes at first, then gradually increase as it gets easier.

The most important thing is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about doing intense workouts right away. A 10-minute daily routine you'll actually do is way better than an hour-long workout you'll skip. Try setting a specific time each day (like right after waking up or before dinner) and treat it as non-negotiable, just like brushing your teeth.

Keep track of your exercise days in a simple way - maybe mark an X on a calendar or use a habit tracking app. Seeing those X's build up can be really motivating. And remember that if you miss a day, it's not the end of the world - just pick up again the next day.

You've already taken the hardest step by deciding to start. Now it's just about taking small, manageable actions each day. You've got this!","It's amazing that you've taken the first step by acknowledging your desire to start a new routine and seeking help - that in itself is a huge accomplishment. Given your flexibility and experience with yoga, you might find it helpful to incorporate some gentle stretches or short yoga sessions into your daily routine, even if it's just 5-10 minutes a day. Since you've mentioned you're good at skipping, you could also try incorporating short bursts of skipping into your routine, maybe 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase the duration as you build endurance. Walking is a great starting point, and it's wonderful that you've already begun - consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like walking for a certain amount of time or distance each day, and reward yourself when you reach those milestones. Remember to be kind to yourself and prioritize your mental health throughout this journey; it might be helpful to explore exercises or activities that bring you joy and help alleviate stress, rather than focusing solely on weight loss. You got this, and we're all rooting for you!","Hey! It's awesome you're taking this step. Starting is always the hardest part. Since you mentioned skipping and yoga, maybe try incorporating those back in, even if it's just for 10-15 minutes a few times a week. The key is consistency, not intensity, especially at the beginning.

Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick *one* small, achievable goal for this week. Maybe it's skipping for 10 minutes three times, or doing a short yoga flow twice. When you hit that goal, celebrate it! That positive reinforcement is huge.

Also, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot, and some days will be harder than others. If you miss a day, don't beat yourself up – just get back on track the next day. Small steps consistently applied are way more effective than trying to do too much too soon and burning out. You got this!

t3_seqz08,[Need Advice] How do I stop procrastinating and actually start doing things?,"Hi everyone, looking for some tips. I’ll start out by being open and honest, I’m inherently lazy. I really wish I wasn’t. I go to sleep every night with the best intentions of waking up at 6am, going to the gym and having a really productive day, however it never pans out that way and I manage to put all of these things off and decide it’s too late. I was wondering what tips and tricks do you guys all have to motivate yourselves and really make the most of a day? Thanks in advance guys!

EDIT: Thank you all so so much for the advice, it’s nice to know that there’s so many people that are willing to offer up advice and even show a little bit of belief in me. It helps more than you could ever even imagine :)",I am a major procrastinator.  The thing that helps me the most is realizing that when I procrastinate I have this false assumption that the future me will be more motivated and capable to complete whatever I am putting off. That is just false.  Now I just assume future me is the biggest fuck off ever and will screw me over and disappoint me.  Doing this changes my mind set enough to either I do it now or it won't get done.  I still procrastinate but I feel the costs sooner and am more likely to do stuff.,"i'm in the same boat. probably the best tip I have is to force yourself a little bit. it's 11pm right now, I'll go to sleep right after I study maths a bit. wake up at 6:30. in the beginning, it wasn't easy. it's winter, and the morning sucks. force yourself to wake up early. just do one thing at a time.

read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/). read it until you memorise everything ryan said. I've read it tens of times in the last few years and still read it every once in a while. it's a great post. learn to forgive yourself. and really live by the idea of having non zero days. above I said i'd sleep after I study maths for a bit. that bit is only 2 minutes for me. I've been doing this for at least two weeks now? yeah, it took me a long time to actually start doing things.

that's why I linked the post. because you gotta learn to forgive yourself. it's okay you're procrastinating right now. and it's okay you'll procrastinate tomorrow too. but do a little everyday. you have a limited amount of willpower, and that's okay. 5 minutes is all you got, that's okay. 

you can't be productive everyday, at least in the beginning. set the bar low, and do it everyday. I've come to a point now where I don't break the chain. i do everything I planned, even if its for a moment. saves me from feeling guilty.

it'll create a habit soon and everything will become easy. if you're like me, just try the pomodoro method. find your perfect setting. for me, right now, it's 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of study. and that chances very often. i just force myself to work 25 minutes and enjoy a 5 minute break. sometimes 5 minutes turn to 10 or 15. but that's okay. i worked for 25 minutes and it's already a non zero day, okay? i worked 3.5 hours today, and procrastinated a lot too. but I felt good about working that much. 

I'm still not doing my best. but at least I don't hate myself for it. I'm trying, and that's enough. i don't need to be productive all the time, I just need to be productive for a minute.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. A lot of us have been in the same boat, so you're definitely not alone. One thing that might help is starting small. Instead of aiming for a complete overhaul of your routine, try focusing on one habit at a time. For example, if waking up at 6am is tough, maybe start by setting your alarm just 15 minutes earlier than usual and gradually work your way up. 

Also, try to identify the key reasons behind your procrastination. Is it because the tasks seem overwhelming? Breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps can make a big difference. And remember, motivation often follows action. Sometimes just starting, even if it's just for 5 minutes, can create the momentum you need to keep going.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Building discipline takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate the small wins and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","First off - you're not inherently lazy. The fact that you want to change and are reaching out for help shows initiative. Let's work on turning those good intentions into actual habits.

Start much smaller than you're planning. Instead of trying to wake up at 6am and hit the gym right away, pick ONE tiny change. Maybe it's just getting up 15 minutes earlier than usual, or putting your workout clothes next to your bed. The key is making it so easy you can't say no.

A game-changer for morning routines is to handle the decisions the night before. Lay out your clothes, pack your gym bag, set up your coffee maker. When you wake up, you just follow the plan on autopilot instead of having to make choices while groggy.

The ""too late"" mindset is a trap. If you miss your ideal morning routine, the day isn't ruined. A 10-minute workout at 2pm is infinitely better than no workout at all. Progress isn't about perfection - it's about consistently taking small steps forward.

Try this for the next week: Pick your ONE small change. Do it for 7 days straight, no matter what. Don't worry about anything else yet. Once that becomes automatic, add another small change. Building discipline is like building muscle - you have to start light and gradually increase the load.

Remember that motivation is unreliable, but habits are powerful. Focus on creating systems that make it easier to do the right thing, rather than relying on willpower alone.","One strategy that might help is to start small and focus on building one new habit at a time. Instead of trying to wake up at 6am and go to the gym right away, try setting your alarm clock 15-30 minutes earlier each day and use that extra time to do something simple like stretching or meditating. Once you've got that habit down, you can gradually add more activities to your morning routine. It's also important to be kind to yourself and not get too discouraged when you don't meet your goals - just acknowledge the setback and try again the next day. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're procrastinating - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's holding you back, you can develop strategies to overcome those obstacles. Remember, developing discipline and new habits takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run. Keep in mind that it's not about being ""lazy"" or ""motivated"", it's about creating systems and routines that support your goals and values.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That gap between intention and action is a killer! It's awesome that you're already aware of what you *want* to do, that's half the battle.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life overnight, maybe try micro-habits. Want to go to the gym? Don't aim for a full workout at 6am right away. Aim to just put on your gym clothes first thing. Seriously, that's it. If you feel like going further, great! If not, you've still accomplished something. The next day, maybe put on your gym clothes *and* walk to the gym. The key is to make it so ridiculously easy that you can't say no.

Also, think about *why* you're procrastinating. Is it fear of failure? Overwhelm? Boredom? Once you identify the root cause, you can start tackling it directly. If it's overwhelm, break down big tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. If it's boredom, try to find ways to make the task more engaging (music, rewards, etc.).

Finally, be kind to yourself. Everyone slips up. Don't beat yourself up over it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You got this!

t3_w15zh2,[Need Advice] Forming the habit of working out at 5am,"I have picked up two habits since last year, flossing daily and cold showers daily. However I just can’t seem to make the habit of working out at 5am stick. I’ve seen how completing the 5am workouts has given me more energy throughout the day and also made me more conscious about my food choices. I want to make this a habit. 
I am a morning person so no problem waking up at 5am but I do find myself gravitating towards work rather than working out. 

Appreciate your advice!","1. Alarm rings
2. Get up within 30 seconds
3. Pee/poop
4. Drink some water
5. Put on workout clothes
6. Work out (or drive to gym)

At no point do you look at your phone, have breakfast, turn on the TV or anything else. You do everything above in order, no exception. You cannot give yourself even a moment's pause where you can think ""Oh, lemme just check reddit first, I'll work out in 20 minutes..."" Because then you won't work out. It needs to become automatic. Alarm rings = immediate workout.",I switch the water and bathroom time. Down a nice tall glass of cold water (a bit more than it feels like is necessary). Wakes you up like a cup of tea!,"Hey there! It's awesome that you've already nailed flossing and cold showers—those are no small feats! For the 5am workout habit, since you're already up at that time, maybe try setting up your workout gear the night before so it's the first thing you see in the morning. You could also schedule your workout like an important meeting, blocking that time off just for exercise. If you find yourself gravitating towards work, maybe set a rule that you can't start work until after your workout. Lastly, consider finding a workout buddy or joining a class to add some accountability. Keep at it, and soon it'll be as automatic as your other habits!","First off, congrats on successfully building those two solid habits - flossing and cold showers are no small feat! The fact that you've already experienced the benefits of 5am workouts (more energy, better food choices) is actually a huge advantage. You know the ""why"" behind wanting to make this stick.

Since you're naturally gravitating toward work in the morning, try creating a physical barrier between you and your work setup. Put your workout clothes right next to your bed the night before, and maybe even sleep in your workout shorts. Make getting to work slightly more difficult than getting to your workout gear.

One effective approach is to start ridiculously small - commit to just 5 minutes of exercise when you first wake up. Often the hardest part is just starting, but once you're moving, you'll likely want to continue. After a week of consistent 5-minute sessions, gradually increase the duration.

You might also try ""habit stacking"" - link your workout to your existing morning routine. Right after your cold shower could be your trigger to exercise. The key is making the workout the path of least resistance in your morning.

Remember that missing one day isn't failure - it's just a data point. What made you choose work instead? Use that insight to adjust your strategy. The goal is progress, not perfection.","It's great that you've already established some solid habits like flossing and cold showers, and now you're looking to add another one. Given that you're a morning person and can wake up at 5am without issue, it sounds like the challenge is more about prioritizing your workout over work. One strategy you could try is to set a clear goal for what you want to achieve with your 5am workouts, and then schedule them in your calendar as non-negotiable appointments. This might help you mentally prepare to put your workout first, before diving into work. Additionally, you could try to make your workout routine more enjoyable, whether that's finding a workout buddy, listening to music or podcasts, or trying out a new type of exercise. This might help shift your motivation and make it feel less like a chore. Lastly, consider starting small - instead of aiming for a full hour-long workout, start with 20-30 minutes and gradually increase the duration as the habit becomes more established. Good luck!","Hey, congrats on the flossing and cold showers, that's awesome! It sounds like you're already building good momentum.

Since you're a morning person and the waking up isn't the issue, it seems like the pull of work is the biggest hurdle. Maybe try these:

1. **Prep the night before:** Lay out your workout clothes, have your water bottle ready, and maybe even pre-select your workout. Reduce any friction that might make you choose work.

2. **Start ridiculously small:** Don't aim for a full hour workout right away. Commit to just 15 minutes. Tell yourself you can stop after 15, but often you'll keep going. It's about building the habit, not crushing a workout every day.

3. **Reward yourself (appropriately):** After your workout, have something you enjoy (that isn't work!). Maybe a specific coffee or a few minutes of reading. Positive reinforcement can work wonders.

4. **Accountability:** Tell someone you're doing this, or find a workout buddy. Knowing someone else is expecting you can be a powerful motivator.

5. **Reframe ""work"":** Is it possible you're using work as a form of avoidance? Maybe there's something about the workout you're not enjoying. Experiment with different types of exercise until you find something you genuinely like.

Good luck, you got this!

t3_sg8l1i,"[Need Advice] Can't sit down to do something for 15 minutes. Not the hobbies that I like, and not my tasks","I do a multitude of things. I write, read, draw, make music, design book covers, learn languages and lately picked up (and dropped) chess. I even liked studying because I loved my field. 

I just can't seem to tolerate the actual process of sitting down and engaging in any of them anymore. I really want to but I can't stand it. I can't write anything, can't draw, can't study--can't stand doing anything persistantly for more than 10 to 15 minutes. I get stressed out and anxious pretty easily and quickly switch to something else to detach my mind. 


On the rare occasions I sit down and really get sucked into something I *can* actually go for hours on end. If I can somehow get myself to be like this all the time, I'd be killing it rn. But it feels like there's a block in my mind stopping me, like a writer's block or an art block, except for my mind as a whole. Cheesy analogy, I know. 


Thought maybe adhd for a while but I dropped that suspicion. Can't say if I've always been like this. This either started or became noticeably bad enough at the beginning of last year/late 2020. Can't say much about my childhood since i don't remember much anyways beside just being a lonely weirdo. 


Personal life aside, my greatest concern rn is my tilting academics. I know what I need to do, I can hash out a good plan to do it, I want to do it, I know I can if I can bring myself to it. But I just can't. Can't start, can't keep going. Some days I'm moderately motivated, others I'm detached. Either way I'm doing nothing. Semester started about six weeks ago, I'm quickly falling behind. My mind, body and heart are refusing to cooperate. 


Can't afford time and money for therapists atm. If anyone has any tips on how to manage this on my own and combat this behaviourally/mentally please share


EDIT: I'd like to emphasize that I do not believe I have had this issue further back than 2021 or 2020. I'm turning 23. This is fairly recent. I relate to r/adhd but it's hard to distinguish adhd from chronic stress for example. The symptoms are similar, the actual culprit is hard to pin point. So I don't think specifically assuming adhd out of a whole bunch is wise, and I'm trying not to carry it anymore 

Either way I'm looking for practical tips that don't involve me going to a therapist because there are literally none around me and if I find one I can't afford seeing them or the meds (bc, developing country w civil unrest rn)","Hi. I'm a therapist, maybe this advice helps a little. From what you write I understand that you dropped the ADHD thing. Others also mention anxiety and depression. What I'm wondering about most is: Have you considered (early) burn-out? The things you describe sound like an overactive nervous system to me, which would typically happen after an extended period of chronic stress (sympathetic activation). After a while the body loses the ability to relax (parasympathetic activation), and we end up feeling restless, unable to focus and unable to connect to even the things we would typically enjoy. So basically you end up developing ADHD/anxiety/depression like behaviour, but the underlying cause, and hence, treatment is fundamentally different. Now obviously I could be wrong, because I am not your therapist, but if the above resonates, I'd try to find professional help","Oh and I forgot: The most important thing is CONNECTING with others. Human interaction, talking with others, being open and genuine about how we feel is the most therapeutic thing. It stimulates parasympathetic activation (calming of the nervous system), I firmly believe that this is the biggest reason why therapy is effective. For those interested, look up something called 'The Polyvagal Theory'","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few strategies that might help you get back on track:

1. **Start Small**: Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes to work on a task. The goal is to make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.

2. **Routine and Environment**: Create a dedicated space and time for your activities. Even if it's just a corner of your room, having a consistent spot can help signal to your brain that it's time to focus.

3. **Mindfulness and Breaks**: Practice mindfulness techniques to help manage stress and anxiety. Also, schedule regular breaks to prevent burnout. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break) can be effective.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what typically distracts you and try to minimize these interruptions. This could mean turning off notifications or using apps that block distracting websites.

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of each day, take a few minutes to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Adjust your approach as needed.

Remember, it's okay to have off days. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!","Your situation sounds really challenging, especially since it's a relatively recent change that's affecting multiple areas of your life. The good news is that you've already identified some key things: you know you're capable of deep focus (those rare occasions when you get absorbed for hours), and you have clear goals and plans. That's actually a strong foundation to build from.

Here's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start treating focus like a muscle that needs gradual training. Instead of aiming for long study sessions right away, set a timer for just 5 minutes. That's less than your current threshold of 10-15 minutes, which makes it more manageable. The key is consistency over duration - do these 5-minute sessions multiple times a day.

When you sit down for these sessions, keep your phone in another room and close all browser tabs except what you absolutely need. Create a clear physical and mental boundary between ""focus time"" and ""everything else.""

After a week of consistent 5-minute sessions, bump it up to 7 minutes. Then 10. Then 15. The gradual increase helps build tolerance without triggering the stress response you're experiencing. Think of it like building stamina - you wouldn't start training for a marathon by running 26 miles on day one.

For your academics specifically, try the ""just one problem"" approach. Instead of thinking about an entire study session, commit to solving just one problem or reading just one page. Often, starting is the hardest part, and this removes that mental barrier.

Remember that progress isn't linear. Some days you'll do better than others, and that's normal. The goal is to slowly rebuild your capacity for sustained attention through consistent, small steps rather than trying to force yourself back to where you were before 2020.","It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough situation, especially with your academics suffering. First, let's break down the fact that you can get engaged in activities for hours when you're fully into them - this suggests that the issue isn't necessarily with your ability to focus, but rather with initiating and maintaining that focus consistently. 

One strategy you might find helpful is the ""2-minute rule"". When you're struggling to start a task, tell yourself you'll work on it for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you can continue beyond those initial 2 minutes. This can help build momentum.

Another approach could be to identify the specific points at which you feel your motivation or focus start to wane. Is it always after a certain amount of time? When you encounter a particular type of task or difficulty? Once you're more aware of these patterns, you can develop strategies to address them, such as taking short breaks before you reach that point of frustration, or breaking down larger tasks into smaller, less daunting ones.

Given your situation with limited access to therapists and the challenges in your environment, it might also be helpful to look into free online resources and communities focused on productivity, focus, and mental health. There are many blogs, podcasts, and forums where people share their experiences and tips for managing similar issues without professional help.

Lastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day or week, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they seem, as this can help build motivation over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds frustrating to have all these interests and the drive to do them, but then hitting a wall after only a few minutes. Since you mentioned it started fairly recently, maybe we can look at some strategies to break this down.

First, try the Pomodoro Technique, but with *really* short bursts. Forget 25 minutes; aim for 5-minute work intervals with a 2-minute break. Seriously. Set a timer. The goal isn't to achieve a ton in those 5 minutes, but to prove to yourself you *can* sit down and focus, even for a tiny bit. Gradually increase the work intervals as you feel comfortable.

Second, think about ""habit stacking."" Link something you *enjoy* doing with something you *need* to do. For example, ""After I play one song on guitar (enjoyable), I'll work on my book cover design for 10 minutes (task)."" The enjoyable activity acts as a reward and a trigger.

Third, and this might sound counterintuitive, embrace the switching. Instead of fighting the urge to jump between tasks, schedule it. Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities. Knowing you *will* get to draw later might make it easier to focus on studying *now*. This can help you feel less trapped and more in control.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot, and it's okay to have off days. Don't beat yourself up if you can't focus. Just acknowledge it, and try again tomorrow. Small, consistent steps are key. Good luck, you got this!

t3_rzso87,[Need Advice] Discipline is constant work,"I'm just putting it up here to remind me. (27F)

1. You don't always get to dk what you want. You need to do it.
2. Nothing wrong with doing things the proper easy way.
3. Get used to discipline now, and it will be easier to keep doing it in the future. 
4. Get a therapist in the future. I learnt a lot of coping skills on my own, and they were not the best. I unlearn some things I got from going up, my parents didn't really know how to help.
5. Start contributing to society!
6. Habits. Start small. Then get bigger.
7. If you need to cry, then cry.","One thing I've noticed is such a pro of being disciplined. It gives you absolute freedom. For example there was a day I was very disciplined, and the next day I slacked a bit on the timing of my meals and sleep. Felt like shit the next day but that's when I realized being disciplined allows me to do what I want day to day, as well as achieving dreams.","one more thing, everybody starts from somewhere","It sounds like you're on a solid path with some great insights already. Discipline really is about consistent effort, and it’s awesome that you’re recognizing that early on. Starting small with habits is key—pick one or two things you can do daily and build from there. It’s like laying bricks; each small action adds up over time. Also, don’t underestimate the power of seeking help when needed, whether it’s from a therapist or a supportive community. It’s okay to lean on others as you grow. And remember, it’s perfectly fine to have those emotional releases like crying; it’s part of being human. Keep pushing forward, and you’ll find that discipline becomes a natural part of your routine. You got this!","These are really solid insights you've gathered! Especially love point #2 about doing things the proper easy way - we often overcomplicate things trying to be ""perfect"" when simple solutions work great.

Your point about starting small with habits is key. The best approach is usually to break things down into tiny, manageable steps. Want to exercise more? Start with 5 minutes. Want to read? Begin with one page per day. These small wins build momentum.

The therapy point really resonates too. Having professional guidance can help us develop better strategies and work through old patterns. Until then, remember that setbacks are normal - discipline isn't about being perfect, it's about getting back on track when we slip up.

One thing I'd add to your list: celebrate small victories. When you stick to a new habit or push through something difficult, take a moment to acknowledge that. It reinforces the positive behavior and makes the journey more sustainable.

Keep building those habits one small step at a time. You've got a great mindset about this being ongoing work - that's exactly what sustainable discipline looks like.","It's great that you're reminding yourself of these important principles for building discipline and a better life. One thing that stands out is your point about starting small with habits - this is really key because it makes the process less overwhelming and allows you to build momentum over time. It's also very wise of you to acknowledge the value of seeking professional help, like a therapist, to work through challenges and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect, it's about making progress and being consistent, so be patient with yourself as you work on these goals. And don't underestimate the power of allowing yourself to feel and express emotions, like crying when you need to - it's a sign of strength, not weakness. Keep moving forward, you're on the right track!","Hey! It sounds like you're on a good path to building more discipline. I especially agree with starting small with habits – it's way more sustainable. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one tiny habit, like making your bed every morning, and focus on that until it's automatic. Then add another. Also, good on you for recognizing the value of therapy. It can be a game-changer for developing healthy coping mechanisms. Keep reminding yourself why you're doing this, and be kind to yourself on the tough days. You got this!

t3_xu29aj,"[Need advice] Is there an age when you need to stop being a jack-of-all-trades, master of none?","I'm 24. I graduated from a Big Ten business school with good grades, and I'm now a consultant at a large accounting firm. I work long hours, but I have enough time for hobbies.

Throughout my life, I've had a variety of interests, ranging from football to musical theater to punk rock. I was in band, cross country, track, NHS, and I was involved in church in high school. Basically, I was stretched thin across many activities.

Now, I have less time to stretch across my hobbies. I'm single, and I want to remain single until I have a better idea of who I am and what I'm into. Do I need to pick a lane a stick to it? i.e should I invest a lot of time and money in one hobby for a while, accepting the opportunity cost of neglecting the other things that I've historically been into?

I might be overthinking things, but I'm struggling and could use advice. If there are any books on this topic, I'd be willing to give them a chance. Thanks!","“a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” That’s the original quote","Soubds like your friend is Batman! Tell him to make a YouTube channel lol

Good luck on your journey, I’m the same","It's great that you're exploring your interests and thinking about how to balance them with your career. At 24, you definitely don't need to have everything figured out, and it's okay to be a jack-of-all-trades. However, if you're feeling stretched thin, it might be helpful to prioritize. Consider which hobbies bring you the most joy or fulfillment and focus on those for a while. You can always revisit other interests later. It's not about picking one thing forever, but about giving yourself the space to dive deeper into what truly resonates with you right now. As for books, ""Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World"" by David Epstein might offer some valuable insights. Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you. Good luck!","There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a jack-of-all-trades at 24 - or any age, really. Having diverse interests makes you well-rounded and adaptable, which are huge assets both personally and professionally. 

That said, your question about focusing makes sense given your limited time. Instead of completely dropping interests, consider cycling through them seasonally or quarterly. You could dedicate 3-4 months to really diving deep into one area while maintaining lighter involvement in others. This lets you progress meaningfully in each interest without totally abandoning the rest.

For example, you might focus on music for a quarter, then switch to fitness, then theater, etc. This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the depth of focused practice and the breadth of varied interests.

The book ""Range"" by David Epstein actually tackles this topic head-on. He makes a strong case for how generalists often thrive in our complex world. Another good read is ""Refuse to Choose"" by Barbara Sher, which specifically addresses managing multiple passions.

Remember that your diverse background isn't a weakness - it's given you a unique perspective and skill set. The goal isn't to become narrowly specialized unless that truly calls to you. Instead, find a sustainable way to nurture your various interests while going deeper into each one at different times.

Your approach to staying single while figuring things out is smart. Use this time to experiment with different ways of managing your interests. You'll naturally discover which activities really light you up and deserve more of your time.","It's great that you're recognizing the value of focus and considering how to prioritize your interests. While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, it's common for people to narrow down their hobbies as they get older and their schedules become more demanding. That being said, you don't necessarily need to choose just one hobby and abandon all others. 

You might consider a ""core and explore"" approach, where you identify one or two activities that bring you the most joy and fulfillment, and invest more time and energy into those. This could be your ""core"" hobby. Then, you can still make time for other interests, but in a more casual or occasional way - this would be your ""explore"" category. For example, if music is a big passion of yours, you could dedicate a few hours each week to playing an instrument or attending concerts, and then occasionally attend a football game or try out a new punk rock venue.

In terms of books, you might find ""Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"" by Greg McKeown helpful. It's all about learning to prioritize what's truly important and eliminating non-essential activities. Another great resource is ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" by Cal Newport, which talks about the importance of focusing on a few key skills or interests in order to develop mastery and achieve success.

Ultimately, the key is to find a balance that works for you and your lifestyle. Experiment with different approaches, and don't be afraid to adjust as needed. It's okay to try new things and pivot when something isn't working out. Good luck!","Hey, it sounds like you're feeling a bit scattered, which is totally normal at 24 and figuring things out. The ""jack-of-all-trades"" question is a common one.

I don't think there's a magic age to specialize, but it's more about what you *want* to get out of your hobbies. Do you want to become truly *good* at something, maybe even competitive? Then yeah, focusing makes sense. But if your hobbies are primarily for enjoyment and stress relief, spreading yourself thin is perfectly fine.

Maybe try this: instead of thinking about permanently ""picking a lane,"" experiment with a few different approaches. Dedicate a set amount of time (say, 2-3 months) to really diving deep into one hobby. See how it feels. Then switch to another. This way, you're not making a huge commitment, but you're giving yourself a chance to explore.

Also, consider *why* you want to ""figure out who you are."" Is it for yourself, or are you feeling pressure from somewhere else? Sometimes just accepting that you're a multi-passionate person is enough.

As for books, ""Refuse to Choose!"" by Barbara Sher might be helpful. It's all about embracing being a ""scanner"" or someone with many interests. Good luck!

t3_13361ow,[Need Advice] Why do I not want to sleep at night even when I am so tired ?,I am 27 yo female. I have a job. I have difficulty in falling asleep when I want to sleep but now there are a lot of times when I don’t even want to fall asleep. It’s 2am now and I know I have a lot to do tomorrow but I just don’t want to go to bed even though I have nothing to do right now and my eyes are closing . I am just forcing myself to be awake for no reason at all. I know there’s a thing such as night time procrastination or something but I just want to go to sleep. Please help.,"Subconsciously retaliating against whatever consumes your free time to give yourself a feeling of control by procrastinating going to sleep. At least that's my guess. I've wrestled with the same thing for years.

Plan time during your day for doing nothing or doing anything, scheduled free time. Talk to your subconscious and have a dialogue, tell it you realize why it's happening but this is not the time and plan a time the next day to exercise that control you're lacking.

I'm not a psychologist but I play one online.",You are welcome! I'm so glad you found it helpful. I like digging around in my own head and studying psychology for my own sake but talking about it and especially being able to provide helpful ideas to others is one of my favorite things.,"It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of tiredness and resistance to going to bed, which can be really frustrating. One thing that might help is creating a bedtime routine that signals to your brain it's time to wind down. Try setting a consistent bedtime and start a relaxing pre-sleep ritual about 30 minutes before, like reading a book, listening to calming music, or doing some light stretching. Also, consider limiting screen time before bed, as the blue light can mess with your sleep cycle. If you find your mind racing, jot down any thoughts or to-dos in a notebook to clear your head. It might take some time, but building these habits can help make sleep more inviting. Good luck!","This is a really common issue called ""revenge bedtime procrastination"" - basically your brain trying to claim back some personal time after a busy day. The tricky part is that staying up late actually steals time from your future self.

What's worked for many people is creating a wind-down routine that starts 1-2 hours before your target bedtime. Turn off bright lights, switch your phone to night mode, and do relaxing activities like reading or light stretching. The key is consistency - pick a bedtime and stick to it even on weekends.

You might also try the ""5-4-3-2-1"" method when you notice yourself resisting sleep: acknowledge 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This helps break that cycle of forcing yourself to stay awake and brings you back to the present moment.

Start small - maybe aim to go to bed just 15 minutes earlier than usual for a week. Once that feels normal, add another 15 minutes. Small wins build momentum. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the pattern and asking for help. You've got this!","It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a paradox - your body is tired, but your mind is resisting sleep. This can be really frustrating, especially when you have a lot to do the next day. One thing that might be going on is that your brain has started to associate bedtime with stress or anxiety about the next day, rather than relaxation. Try to establish a calming pre-sleep routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down - this could be as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches. Additionally, make sure your sleep environment is comfortable and conducive to sleep - cool, dark, and quiet. As for the nighttime procrastination, try setting a specific ""stop doing things"" time, say 10 or 11 pm, and commit to relaxing after that. It might also be helpful to write down your tasks for the next day before bed, so you can clear your mind and feel more in control. Remember, it's okay to not be perfect, and it's normal to have nights where you struggle to sleep - but by establishing some consistent habits and routines, you can start to train your brain to associate bedtime with rest, rather than resistance.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's super frustrating to know you *should* sleep but your brain just won't let you. It sounds like you're experiencing ""revenge bedtime procrastination,"" which is pretty common.

One thing that might help is establishing a really solid wind-down routine. Start maybe an hour or two before you *want* to be asleep. Dim the lights, put away your phone (seriously, put it in another room!), and do something relaxing like reading a book (a real one, not on a screen), taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. The key is consistency – your brain will start to associate these activities with sleep.

Also, think about *why* you might be avoiding sleep. Are you stressed about something? Are you feeling like you don't have enough ""you"" time during the day? If so, try to address those underlying issues. Maybe schedule in some time for hobbies or relaxation earlier in the evening.

Finally, don't beat yourself up about it! If you have a bad night, just try again the next night. It takes time to build new habits. Good luck!

t3_w61v7w,"[Need Advice] I really want to change, I don't want to live this way anymore.","Hey so, I've been struggling with depression for... Well, honestly my whole life, as well as anxiety. I don't like to think of these as excuses, but I do recognize they can make things difficult for me. I've just also never had self discipline. I don't want to sound snobby, but I've never had to try. I've had at least moderate success in just about everything I've tried, school included, though I've always had good grades. However, I procrastinate everything until the absolute last second, even if I know about it and don't mean to. I always mean to do things, my brain just... Kind of shuts down if I need to do tasks? I'm in therapy and everything, but my change isn't fast enough for me. 

I've always gotten by in school without studying. I just pretty much cram and skim until I find answers, and it's ALWAYS the day of the due date. I literally procrastinated my entire senior year of high school (As in I didn't do any of it) until the final week. And I still PASSED. I think I huge reason why I repeat this behavior is because I still succeed. 

However. I want to get back into reading. I want to start editing videos again. I want to start eating healthier (Right now my main goal is to kick my binge-eating habit). And honestly I want to study. I want to be what I would consider a traditional student. It's just incredibly difficult for me to even do things like showering on time (Gross I know), but I'm just always exhausted, and have never known motivation. There's so many things I want to do, and I keep trying and failing. I need help and I just don't know what to do. 

Thank you if you've read this far, sorry if it's disorganized at all it's past 4am and I haven't been able to sleep (Another thing I want to fix)","Hello! First of all, I'm proud of you for making this far! It is amazing that you have accomplished so much with those two horses dragging you down! Congratulations! Really!

Second of all, asking for help is already another step foward. I also have depression and anxiety and I know how it is to have those blockdowns. That being said, how are you with social media? I found out that, for me, not having a time limit on instagram and tiktok made me scroll aimlessly between them until I feel too guilty to do anything. So what I did is that I put a time-limit on tiktok with a password and my bf set the password up, so I have no clue what it is. You could do something similar if you have someone you trust to set up a password for you. If you don't, you can always put the time limit yourself and it will, at least, make you remember that this is not good for you and you'll probably move on to do something better.

When you are in a low moment of your life and just don't feel like doing nothing, choose a comfort movie for you and watch it. It requires no effort and, in the end, you will be feeling slightly better, maybe better enough to do one small taks like taking the garbage out. And this can become a snowball effect if you are in the mood: ""I already done this, so I can do that other slightly bigger thing now"" and so on.

In therapy, idk about you, but I sometimes hid what I was ashamed of concerning my behaviour so my therapist thought I was getting better. DON'T BE LIKE ME! Tell all the worse and the best things to your therapist!!! Only then change can get to you faster. You need to tell everything.

Concerning the binge-eating, idk who does the shopping at you home, but if it is you, build up the strenght to simply not buy what you binge-eat. You could also try to replace the foods with popcorn (with little butter and a pinch of salt), that is healthier, or buy more fruits and have them already saved on the fridge sliced, so that you can binge eat those. One fruit that helps me a lot (since sometimes I just don't have the energy to slice fruit up) is grapes. I love those green grapes that are ""seedless"" and they only require you wash them before you eat, so I always buy a great amount of them and when I feel the urge to eat something bc I'm anxious I go to the fridge, grab them and there you go, eating but not those muffins I used to eat before. Nuts in general are also a good option, the thing is to control yourself to eat one at a time and not put a handful in your mouth.

And finally, I know how you feel about wanting to do everything all at once and then getting frustrated because you can't. Try this: for this month, I want to get back to reading, so every week from now on I will choose a short story to read. If I manage to do so, I will get a book to read, and I will finish it until the end of the year (remember, set major goals that are volatile and with a large expiration date, only the minor goals within the major ones should be with an expiration date closer to you). To do so, you can say ""I will try to read at least one page before going to bed/after waking up/during lunch"". And you can adapt this scheme to any other goals you might have. Just remember, it is little penguin steps at a time, because if you set a goal that is minor, it is easier to go beyond that and you will feel amazing bc you did more than you have set to do. This won't happen if you set a major goal that is difficult to achieve right away.

(Oh, and one more thing, if you are the competitive type, you can make a competition with yourself, like ""I dare myself to cut this whole watermelon and put it in the fridge before this podcast episode ends"" and  if you don't make it, you at least already started doing it, so you can set another challenge ""I will do this before the sun sets"" or something else you feel appropriate to you)

I hope this all helps :)",Untreated adhd,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're in therapy and seeking change—those are big steps. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but wanting to improve is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one habit to focus on first. Maybe it's reading a few pages a day or setting a specific time to shower. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Instead of vague goals like ""eat healthier,"" try something specific like ""eat one fruit a day."" This makes it easier to track progress.

3. **Create a Routine**: Consistency can help with discipline. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This might also help with your sleep issues.

4. **Use Timers**: If you struggle to start tasks, set a timer for just 5-10 minutes. Often, starting is the hardest part, and once you begin, you might find it easier to keep going.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for small achievements. It can be as simple as taking a moment to appreciate your effort.

6. **Accountability**: Share your goals with someone you trust or join a community that can support you. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can be motivating.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","Thanks for sharing your situation - it's actually pretty common for naturally gifted people to struggle with discipline since they haven't needed to develop those muscles before. The good news is that discipline is a skill that can be built, just like any other.

Start really small. Like, microscopically small. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Maybe it's reading for 5 minutes before bed, or doing one push-up, or setting a consistent wake-up time. The key is making it so easy you can't say no.

For the procrastination, try the 2-minute rule: tell yourself you only have to work on something for 2 minutes. Usually once you start, you'll keep going. But if you stop after 2 minutes, that's fine too - you still succeeded at your goal.

For the sleep issues, start by setting a consistent wake-up time (even if you go to bed late). Your bedtime will naturally adjust over time. Getting your sleep schedule fixed will help with the exhaustion and make other changes easier.

The binge eating is worth addressing with your therapist specifically, as it often ties into deeper emotional patterns. In the meantime, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting - maybe start with eating one piece of fruit each day.

Remember that failing attempts aren't failures - they're practice runs that teach you what doesn't work. Each time you try again, you're building that discipline muscle a tiny bit stronger. Progress isn't linear, but small consistent efforts compound over time.

You've already taken positive steps by going to therapy and reaching out for advice. Keep building on that momentum, one tiny habit at a time.","It sounds like you're recognizing the patterns that have held you back in the past and wanting to make some significant changes, which is a huge step. Given your history of procrastination and lack of self-discipline, it might be helpful to start small and focus on building habits rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. For example, instead of trying to become a ""traditional student"" overnight, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes one or two productive tasks, like reading for 15 minutes or doing a quick workout. 

It's also important to acknowledge that your depression and anxiety are likely playing a role in your motivation and energy levels, so be sure to continue working with your therapist to develop strategies for managing those conditions. In terms of building motivation, you might find it helpful to identify the reasons why you want to make these changes - what is it about reading, editing videos, or eating healthier that's important to you? What benefits do you hope to get from developing these habits? Having a clear sense of purpose and meaning can help drive your motivation and make it easier to stick with your goals. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - building self-discipline and new habits takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing the need for change and seeking help, so try to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through this process.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you *want* to change is huge. That's the first step! It's also really common to struggle with discipline, especially when you've been able to coast by on natural talent.

Since you're already in therapy, that's a great foundation. Maybe you could specifically discuss these procrastination and motivation issues with your therapist? They might have tailored strategies for you.

In the meantime, try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Want to read? Don't aim for a chapter, aim for *one page*. Want to edit videos? Open the software. Seriously, that's it. The momentum of just starting can often carry you further. This is especially helpful when you're feeling exhausted.

For the binge eating, maybe focus on *adding* healthy things instead of just restricting. Like, can you add one serving of veggies to each meal? Small wins build confidence.

And for the sleep thing, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. It's brutal at first, but it can really regulate your energy levels.

The key is to be patient with yourself. You're not going to become a super-disciplined person overnight. Celebrate the small victories, and don't beat yourself up when you slip up. It's a process, not a race. Good luck, you got this!

I thought maybe I am tired and this is just a phase but its been a month. I stopped contacting my research supervisor and couldn't get anything done. Now I am scared of contacting him to tell him that I couldn't do anything. Could anyone give me some advice here?,"Something like this? 

Dear Professor ____,

I wanted to apologize for not contacting you in the past month. I've been struggling with writer's block and mental health issues, and I wasn't able to complete my coursework. I've been slowly overcoming my mental block and am trying to start up my work again. If you're still willing to help me, I'd really appreciate any advice you have for me moving forward. I will keep you better informed in the future, and I'm extremely sorry for the lack of communication last month.

Sincerely,

I'd reword/add in personal details about your writer's block and research, but hopefully this gives you a template for what to say to them!","This is soo good, literally can't think of a better message","First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—acknowledging the issue is a big step. Here's a plan you might find helpful: Start by drafting an honest email to your supervisor. Keep it simple and straightforward. Explain that you've been struggling with productivity and that you're committed to getting back on track. Most supervisors appreciate honesty and will likely be more understanding than you expect. 

Next, try breaking your work into smaller, manageable tasks. Set specific goals for each day, even if they're small, to help you build momentum. Consider using techniques like the Pomodoro Technique to maintain focus. Also, establish a routine that includes regular check-ins with your supervisor to keep you accountable. Remember","Hey there - this is a tough situation but it's more common than you might think. The longer you wait to contact your supervisor, the harder it becomes, but you need to rip off the bandaid and reach out ASAP. 

Send a brief, professional email acknowledging the gap in communication and requesting a meeting. Something like: ""I apologize for my lack of communication over the past month. I've been struggling with the work and should have reached out sooner. Could we please schedule a meeting to discuss my progress and next steps?""

When you meet, be honest but solution-focused. Explain that you hit a wall with writing but are committed to getting back on track. Come prepared with a concrete plan for catching up and staying accountable going forward - maybe weekly check-ins or breaking the work into smaller milestones.

Most supervisors have seen students struggle before and will appreciate you taking responsibility and being proactive about solutions. The key is to act now rather than letting more time pass. Once you restart communication, focus on building momentum with small daily writing sessions, even if just 25 minutes. You got this - the first step is always the hardest.","It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to reach out to your supervisor after a month of radio silence. The first step is to acknowledge that it's okay to have struggled and that many people face similar blocks in their research. When you do decide to contact your supervisor, honesty is usually the best policy - explain your situation, apologize for the lack of communication, and take responsibility for not meeting your obligations. You might say something like, ""Hi [Supervisor], I wanted to reach out and apologize for my lack of communication over the past month. Unfortunately, I've been struggling to make progress on my research and haven't been able to complete the tasks you assigned. I'm committed to getting back on track and would like to discuss a plan to move forward."" This approach shows that you're taking ownership of your work and are willing to make things right. Remember, your supervisor is there to help you succeed, and it's better to address the issue now rather than letting it linger. Take a deep breath, draft a message, and take the first step towards getting back on track.","Hey, it happens to the best of us. That feeling of being stuck is super frustrating. The longer you wait, the harder it gets, so the first thing is to just rip off the band-aid and contact your supervisor. Acknowledge you messed up, apologize briefly (don't make excuses), and most importantly, tell him you want to get back on track and ask for a meeting to discuss how to move forward.

Before that meeting, try to identify *why* you got stuck. Was the task too big? Were you unsure how to approach it? Did you lose interest? Understanding the reason will help you explain the situation to your supervisor and prevent it from happening again.

In the meeting, be prepared to suggest a revised plan. Break down the original task into smaller, more manageable steps. Set realistic deadlines for each step. Maybe even ask your supervisor for more frequent check-ins, at least initially, to keep you accountable.

The key is to show your supervisor that you're taking responsibility and are committed to getting back on track. Good luck, you got this!

t3_zalna8,"[Need Advice] - I was a good student and then everything changed with me, I started wasting time, dropped all my productive habits, started porn addiction, missing lectures and tests and basically ruined myself.","It’s been one year since the above mentioned situation is going on. I have numerous times tried to get out of it but just I can’t. I know what to do, but just can’t get on the way of doing it. I have gotten fat, unhealthy, been lying to my parents, watching porn all day. This has been the worst year of my entire life. 
Kindly tell how should I become a good and responsible man from this rock bottom.

My goals are to get regular in studies, stop porn addiction, a start a fitness regime, and also follow some hobbies like reading and learning piano.","I'm currently in a similar situation. Although I can't say ""THIS WORKS"", I can just tell you how I'm about to approach it. I've been consuming productivity advices for about 2 years now, so I might actually put some to action, isn't that true? Well then...

I'm going to start small. E.g. Study for 15 minutes, then take 5 minutes break (basically a less demanding pomodoro method). 

I will block the sites I don't want to visit. Whenever I find myself opening such a site (because bad habits take long to break), I will walk out of the room and get some small exercise in (10 push-ups), while rethinking the whole thing, then hopefully closing that site and doing something that improves me - reading or as I want to get better at drawing, I might do that.

I will create a study plan and print it out, so that I can see it at all times. And stick to it.

I will have my meals planned out for the entire week, so that I can focus on more important stuff. 

I will clear my workplace of any distraction. Environment has huge impact on what I do, after all. I will clear out my room of anything I don't need or can put away = more space, less distraction.

YES, I write this for myself. But it might help other people get some ideas of where to start.

Also, I can recommend reading Atomic Habits by James Clear for further ideas.","Amazing man, at least you’ve started. Definitely I will apply things you’ve stated.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It takes a lot of courage to admit when things aren't going well, so give yourself some credit for that. Here's a plan you might find helpful:

Start small. Pick one habit to focus on first. Since you mentioned studies, maybe start by setting a specific time each day dedicated to studying, even if it's just 30 minutes. Consistency is key, and once you get into the groove, you can gradually increase the time.

For the porn addiction, consider using apps or browser extensions that block adult content. It might also help to identify triggers and find alternative activities to distract yourself when the urge hits, like going for a walk or playing the piano.

Incorporate fitness into your routine by starting with something simple, like a daily walk or a short workout video. As you build confidence, you can explore more structured fitness plans.

Lastly, for hobbies like reading and learning piano, set aside a little time each week. Even 10-15 minutes a day can make a difference and help you rediscover the joy in these activities.

Remember, progress might be slow, and that's okay. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself along the way. You've got this!","First off - you've already taken a huge step by acknowledging where you are and deciding to make a change. That self-awareness is crucial.

The key is to start small and build momentum. Don't try to fix everything at once - that's a recipe for feeling overwhelmed and giving up. Pick ONE habit to focus on first. Given your goals, I'd suggest starting with a simple morning routine: wake up at the same time every day and immediately make your bed. This tiny win first thing creates momentum for the day.

For the porn addiction, install website blockers and keep your devices out of your bedroom. Replace that time with something else - maybe those piano lessons you mentioned. When urges hit, get up and move - do pushups, go for a walk, anything to break the pattern.

For studies, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day and build up. Sit in the front of your lectures - it makes it harder to skip or zone out.

For fitness, begin with a 15-minute walk each day. That's it. Once that becomes habit (usually takes about 2-3 weeks), add basic bodyweight exercises or extend the walking time.

The most important thing is consistency over intensity. Small steps done regularly will get you much further than trying to transform everything overnight. Pick that one first habit, commit to it for 30 days, then add another.

Check back in here regularly - accountability helps. You've got this. A year from now, you'll be amazed at how far you've come.","It sounds like you've hit rock bottom and are ready to make a change, which is a huge step in itself. To start getting back on track, I'd recommend focusing on building small, achievable habits rather than trying to overhaul your entire life at once. For example, instead of trying to study for hours a day, start by committing to attend one lecture or complete one assignment per day. Similarly, with fitness, begin with short 10-15 minute workouts or walks and gradually increase the duration and intensity. 

Regarding your porn addiction, it might be helpful to identify the triggers that lead you to watch porn and find alternative activities to replace it, such as reading or listening to music. You could also consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with personalized guidance and support.

It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that setbacks will happen. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, but instead focus on getting back on track as soon as possible. Having a accountability partner, such as a friend or family member, can also be helpful in staying motivated.

Lastly, try to rebuild your relationship with your parents by being honest with them about your struggles and seeking their support. It's better to have an open and honest conversation with them rather than continuing to lie and feeling guilty about it.

Remember, becoming a good and responsible person is a journey, not a destination. It takes time, effort, and patience, but it's definitely possible. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging your problems and seeking help, so now it's time to take small steps towards building a better life for yourself.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and want to change is a huge first step. It's totally possible to climb out of this, even though it feels overwhelming right now.

First, don't try to fix everything at once. That's a recipe for burnout. Pick *one* thing to focus on initially. Since you mentioned studies, maybe start with just attending one lecture a day, even if you don't feel like it. Just show up. That's it. Small wins build momentum.

For the porn addiction, recognize that it's often a coping mechanism. Try to identify what triggers it – stress, boredom, loneliness? Once you know the triggers, you can start finding healthier ways to deal with them. There are some great subreddits dedicated to breaking that habit, you might find support there. Also, consider blocking software if you need it.

Fitness can be a great way to boost your mood and energy. Start ridiculously small. Like, 5 minutes of stretching or a 10-minute walk. The goal is to build a habit, not run a marathon on day one.

As for hobbies, schedule them in like appointments. Even 15 minutes of reading or messing around on the piano is better than nothing.

The key is consistency, not perfection. You're going to slip up. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Be kind to yourself, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this.

t3_u0taxy,[Need advice] I’ve lost my spark.,"I’m a 22yo female. Growing up, I loved learning. I was a branded as a ‘gifted’ child. I always worked so hard. After my GCSE’s, it felt like my ability to stay motivated started declining. I’ve now graduated from university and it’s a struggle to do anything. 

As for background info, I was prescribed antidepressants 4 years ago. Over that time, I’ve tried different types and doses. I think the most recent change was about 2 years ago. My depression has definitely contributed to times of feeling lethargic and demotivated, but lately it feels different.

After graduating last July, I had a few months break before getting a retail job to earn some money. I left at the end of January this year to take the time to apply for a masters course. Any time I felt drained, I assumed it was from being at work a lot or recovering from my retail routine, however, it’s now been months and I’m still struggling. 

I have a lot of hobbies. I get interested in something for a while and then move onto something new. Some stick, a lot don’t. Now, I can’t seem to do any of them. I have dreams and goals, but anything more than getting out of bed feels too difficult. I have a very imaginative mind, but I no longer feel like I have the motivation to put it to use. Occasionally, I’ll have a day where I manage to clean my whole room or go for a run, but soon I go back to how I felt before. Even small attempts to break the cycle don’t seem to work for me. If they do, I eventually go back to struggling with things like putting a sock in a drawer. It makes me angry, frustrated and I feel worthless.

Ordinarily, I find it hard to accept that sometimes my mental health prevents me from doing things. I automatically think I am making excuses and that I’m using my depression as one. I even feel like I’m making my depression up at times and convince myself I am attention seeking. Now, it’s even worse and I can’t stop worrying that I’m using depression as an excuse for plain laziness. I’ve wondered if something like ADHD or bi-polar is responsible, but again, I feel I am looking for a reason to explain ordinary laziness. 

I often see things like ‘don’t demand too much of yourself’ and ‘it’s ok if all you did today was survive’ or ‘you are allowed to take a break’, but I tell myself that these don’t apply to me. I shouldn’t go easy on myself because I have no reason to be like this. I am just lazy and useless and it is my own fault.

I just want to go back to feeling motivated and being productive. Or, at least, I want to feel less guilty about not being able to. I’d love any advice or reassurance - I think it would really help. Thanks :)","What is your degree?  Is there any passion left there?  Is there a place that’s cool AF for that subject/activity?  (Kind of a Pilgrimage). I’m an engineer with ADHD.  Going to visit Kennedy Space Center reminded me why I got that degree.   I’m old compared to you and have a cool job now, but I was stuck doing crap I kinda hated for a long long time.  Just hang in there.  

Also, exercise is great.  Yoga is the bestest exercise because you get to meditate at the same time.  Playing music helps.  Helping other people takes the focus off of you and gives you some quick wins.  Us ADHD folks need that quick dopamine hit.

Hang in there.",I never thought about it until a few years ago. It didn’t seem to be prevalent as a child but I definitely share symptoms with it. I’ll maybe make an appointment with my GP to see if I could be assessed. Thanks!,"Hey there! First off, it's really brave of you to share your story, and it's clear you're trying to find a way forward. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to acknowledge that mental health can have a huge impact on motivation and energy levels. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's not just laziness.

One thing that might help is to start small and build from there. Instead of focusing on big goals, try setting tiny, manageable tasks each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or spending 5 minutes on a hobby. Celebrate these small wins, because they do matter.

Also, consider creating a routine that includes time for rest and self-care. Sometimes, having a structure can help provide a sense of normalcy and accomplishment. Remember, it's okay to have off days, and it's okay to rest. You're not making excuses; you're taking care of yourself.

If you haven't already, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional about how you're feeling. They can offer guidance tailored to your situation and help you explore if there are other factors at play, like ADHD or something else.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. You're doing your best, and that's enough. It's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this!","Hey there. What you're experiencing sounds really challenging, and it's completely understandable to feel frustrated. The ""gifted kid burnout"" is a very real phenomenon, and the transition after university can be particularly tough.

First off, please know that seeking explanations for how you're feeling isn't making excuses - it's trying to understand yourself better so you can move forward. Whether it's depression, ADHD, or something else, these are real medical conditions that deserve proper attention. Consider talking to your doctor about how your current medication is working and potentially getting evaluated for ADHD, as many of your experiences align with its symptoms.

Now, for some practical steps forward: Instead of trying to recapture your old spark all at once, start rebuilding it gradually. Pick one tiny habit - something ridiculously small like putting away one item before bed. The goal isn't to clean your whole room; it's to build trust with yourself that you can do something consistently.

When you have those occasional productive days, rather than seeing the return to struggle as failure, try to identify what made those days different. Was it better sleep? More structure? Understanding these patterns can help you recreate more good days.

Also, those messages about being gentle with yourself? They absolutely apply to you. Think of it this way: if you were training for a marathon after being inactive, you wouldn't start by running 26 miles. You'd start with walking, then jogging, gradually building up your stamina. The same applies to mental and emotional energy.

Consider setting up a very simple routine - even just 10 minutes of something you used to enjoy, without any pressure to be ""productive."" The goal isn't to feel motivated (motivation follows action, not the other way around), but to simply show up and do the thing, however imperfectly.

Remember: you're not lazy or worthless. You're someone who's dealing with real challenges and actively seeking ways to improve. That alone shows strength and determination, even if it doesn't feel that way right now.","It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough mix of feelings, from guilt and frustration to worries about your motivation and mental health. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you've recognized the patterns and are seeking help - that in itself is a huge step. 

Given your history with depression and the fact that you've been on different medications, it might be helpful to have an open conversation with your doctor or a therapist about how you're feeling now. It's possible that your treatment plan could be adjusted or that there are other underlying factors at play, like ADHD or bipolar disorder, as you've mentioned. But even if that's not the case, talking through your feelings and experiences with a professional can provide valuable insights and strategies to cope.

In terms of building motivation and productivity, it might be helpful to start incredibly small. Instead of trying to tackle big projects or hobbies, begin with tiny, manageable tasks like making your bed or putting away one item. Celebrate each of these tiny wins, no matter how insignificant they seem. Sometimes, getting momentum going, even at a very slow pace, can help build confidence and motivation.

It's also important to challenge the narrative that you're lazy or useless. Those are harsh judgments that don't account for the complexities of mental health, personal growth, or the simple fact that everyone has ups and downs. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay, and that taking care of your mental health is not something to be ashamed of. 

Lastly, consider keeping a journal or log of your days - not to track productivity, but to observe patterns, feelings, and small accomplishments. This can help you identify times when you feel more motivated or capable, and what might contribute to those feelings.

Remember, rebuilding motivation and finding your spark again is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You're not alone in this struggle, and there are people who believe in you and want to support you through it.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling lost and frustrated. It's great that you're reaching out.

First off, cut yourself some slack. You've been through a lot – graduating, navigating antidepressants, and dealing with the post-retail slump. It's not laziness; it sounds more like burnout and potentially some lingering effects from the depression.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, maybe focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps. Like, instead of cleaning your whole room, could you just put one thing away? Or instead of a run, a 5-minute walk around the block? The idea is to make the barrier to entry so low that it's almost impossible to say no. Those small wins can build momentum.

Also, it might be worth revisiting your doctor about your medication. You mentioned it was changed two years ago, and sometimes things need tweaking. It's a process, and it's okay to ask for help with it.

Regarding the hobbies, don't pressure yourself to stick with something if it's not bringing you joy. Maybe try revisiting an old hobby you used to love, or explore something completely new without any expectations. The point is to experiment and see what sparks your interest, even if it's just for a little while.

Finally, challenge those negative thoughts. You're not lazy or useless. You're a person who's struggling, and that's okay. Try writing down those negative thoughts and then writing down a more realistic and compassionate response to each one. It sounds cheesy, but it can help reframe your thinking. You've got this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

t3_u9hpyu,[Need Advice] Can you please help me in building a routine?,"
Earlier in the year, i had started off a routine with a tracker and everything. It was short lived. 

I had a couple depressive episodes and routines then became exhausting. 

I feel like i messed up my routine and now there’s so many things i need to finish . It’s making me feel unhappy to be such a shit person who doesnt get things done. I was never a routine kinda person but this is just bad. 


My other problem is I’m very unrealistic when it comes to planning, i cannot fix this as many times i have tried. I plan for things, i know based on past history, that sounds unrealistic but i keep hoping and making a plan . (Eg: morning workout).


I wanted to wakeup early, have a mental chill space before i start working. I managed doing that this week, i woke up at 6:30/7 am but I’m in bed till 9 scrolling on my phone . I have to start my laptop then lol

I just hate it.

I used to do small chores this year. And now it’s piling up and on weekends all i want to do is chill.


Things i want to do:
-Wake up at 6:30 am, sleep at 11/11:30 pm
-Work 9-5 (strictly) and not procrastinate 
-workout -hiitt/walk
-mental health -journal/meditation
-proactively do chores 
- enjoy


Can anybody help with a timetable kinda thing? Or a basic structure. I’ve created many and just dont work.

I’m so sick of this. I know i have same hours as others and some of the lists I’ve seen is brilliant and here i cant get more than one thing done a day. It’s affecting my work performance too.


Edit: thanks for all the responses. Didn’t realize this post got quite a few response. For those who are struggling too, feel free to save this thread and refer to it whenever.  Again, thanks!!","It might be useful to understand how habits work.

For habits a few things that helped me were knowing:

* They become automatic
* They can be measured (using the Self Report Habit Index) and you should record them to help with adherence
* They take longer than you think to establish (average: 66 days)
* It's generally better to start one at a time (though there are exceptions)
* They get harder before getting easy
* Implementation Intention, forming a clear trigger, is really key
* Mental Contrasting, planning for potential stumbling blocks is also a lab tested method of getting to a habit
* Tiny Habits, starting ridiculously small UNTIL the habit forms up, THEN and only then expanding it, really helps avoid the tendency to quit after 2 or 3 weeks.
* When forming they don't require a strict streak. So if you miss a day, remember that the habit is a deeper structure in the brain that is still forming. So be compassionate, pick it up tomorrow, and try not to make it a streak of missing the activity. Do not think you're starting from square one.

So right there you've got a good starting map. You might also think about how sleep works. Some things that helped me with my sleep issues were:

* Figuring out the variables that had the most impact. For me that was light and caffeine.
* Getting more light - especially 30 min as soon as I got up - significantly improved my sleep onset latency
* Programming my phone helped as well. Blue light filters automatically go on, and I""m seriously considering using the Bixby Samsung Routines app to just block all distracting apps at bed time.
* Nighttime routines are great, but most people will formalize them by saying ""I'll do X BEFORE I go to bed"". That's not how habits work. You need a trigger first - so set one if you're going to make a nighttime habit.
* Some great nighttime habits are alternative bridging activities that get you ready for bed. Journaling, stretching, light meditation, pranayama, creativity and art (non perfectionist, low stakes) works great for me.
* I found that my natural wakeup time has more to do with what I did the day before. Focusing on getting that morning light and getting to bed on time helped make waking up early *solidly* solved, and not a matter of setting a bunch of stressful alarms, which is a topical solution.

Productivity at work:

* There's a lot here, but one thing that really helped me was understanding optimal work times. I highly recommend Cal Newport's book Deep Work.
* He advocates really being strict by building up. Most people can't just jump into even a bit of deep work without strain.
* Managing productivity is a whole thing unto itself. It's navigating the post lunch slump, knowing how, when, and what breaks to take. And it's knowing how to assign what KIND of task when - if you're tired, you probably don't want to be editing anything.
* One of the best things that helped me was interspersing workouts with work. The optimal work:rest ratio is 52:17, which gives me enough time to do some micro workouts. Not only can you get a full workout in (and there are people talking about this is you look it up), but you energize yourself without tiring yourself out with a full separate workout habit. Behaviorally it also seems to lodge the workout habit (very quickly) in better because it's sandwiched between another structure of work. Obv, this depends on your work, but it's something to think about.

Hope some of that helps!","Not sure anyone else mentioned this, but... I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I spent a decade HUGELY struggling. Might be worthwhile to investigate if you've got some underlying conditions that are making it harder to start habits and manage the flow of your day. My road forward didn't really properly begin until the diagnosis.","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's great that you're reaching out for help. Building a routine can be challenging, especially when life throws curveballs. Here’s a simple approach that might help:

Start small and focus on one habit at a time. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine, pick one thing to work on, like waking up at 6:30 am. Once that becomes a habit, add the next thing, like a short morning workout. 

For your phone scrolling, try placing your phone out of reach when you go to bed. This way, when you wake up, you’re less tempted to grab it first thing. You could also try setting a specific time to start your laptop, like 8:30 am, to give yourself a buffer for a morning routine.

When it comes to chores, try the ""two-minute rule."" If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This can help prevent things from piling up.

Remember, it's okay to have off days. Progress isn’t about being perfect; it’s about being consistent over time. Celebrate small wins and be kind to yourself. You’ve got this!","Hey there - I totally get the struggle with routines, especially after dealing with depressive episodes. The key is to start much smaller than you might think and build up gradually.

Instead of trying to implement that full routine at once, pick just ONE small thing to focus on for the next week. Since you mentioned wanting that morning mental space, let's start there. When you wake up at 6:30, immediately put your phone in another room and sit somewhere comfortable for just 5 minutes. That's it. Don't worry about meditation or journaling yet - just sit quietly for 5 minutes.

Once that becomes easier (maybe after a week or two), add one more small thing. Maybe it's doing a 5-minute stretch routine right after your quiet time. Then maybe a week later, add making your bed. 

The reason your previous routines didn't stick is likely because you were trying to change too much at once. Our brains resist big changes, but can handle tiny ones. Think of it like building a house - you need a solid foundation before adding walls and a roof.

For the phone scrolling issue - try putting your phone across the room before bed so you physically have to get up to turn off the alarm. Once you're up, don't grab the phone - just head to your quiet spot for those 5 minutes.

Remember that consistency matters more than perfection. If you miss a day, just pick back up the next morning. No need to beat yourself up or start over. You're not a shit person - you're someone who's actively working on self-improvement, and that alone is worth being proud of.

Start small, be patient with yourself, and build up slowly. You've got this.","It sounds like you're really struggling to get back into a routine after some setbacks, and that's totally understandable. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing your tendency to be unrealistic with planning - that's a huge step. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on building habits one at a time, rather than trying to overhaul your entire schedule at once. For example, you could start by committing to waking up at 6:30 am and doing just one thing, like journaling or meditating, before getting ready for work. 

As for your timetable, instead of creating a rigid schedule, you might try blocking out larger chunks of time for different activities, like ""work"" or ""self-care,"" and then be more flexible within those blocks. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by trying to stick to a super detailed plan. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be perfect - if you miss a day or two, don't give up. Just get back on track as soon as you can.

In terms of procrastination, you might try breaking down your work tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then focus on making progress on one task at a time. And hey, it's great that you're aware of your tendency to scroll through your phone in the morning - maybe try replacing that with something else, like reading or listening to music, to help you ease into your day.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself, okay? It's clear you're really struggling, but you're also taking steps to address it, and that takes a lot of courage. Keep in mind that building discipline and habits is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out and aware of the issues is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much about past routines failing; depressive episodes can really throw a wrench in things.

Instead of aiming for a rigid timetable right away, maybe try focusing on one or two key habits to start. Since you mentioned the morning phone scrolling, how about this: aim to get out of bed within 15 minutes of waking up for a week. No pressure to work out or meditate, just get your feet on the floor. Baby steps are key.

For the unrealistic planning, try ""chunking"" your goals. Instead of planning a full HIIT workout, tell yourself you'll do 5 minutes of jumping jacks. Often, starting is the hardest part, and you might find yourself doing more. If not, 5 minutes is still a win!

Regarding chores, maybe pick one small task per day. Load the dishwasher, wipe down the counter, etc. It's less overwhelming than a weekend marathon.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not a ""shit person"" for struggling. Building habits takes time and consistency, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate the small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Good luck, you got this!

t3_slz1uo,[Need Advice] Why do I always feel the need to sleep after lunch?,"As the title says, i really don't know why I feel tired every afternoon. Like as soon as I finish eating I need to go to sleep or spend at least 30-60 minutes on the bed.

I tried studying or doing something that I like as soon as lunch was over, but I always keep coming back to my bed. 

Any advice is appreciated, like why is this happening, how can I fix this etc...","Food intake(especially carbs) increases blood sugar(transient hyperglycemia). This is brought under control by insulin released by special cells in the pancreas. It is hypothesized that hyperglycemia reduces the level of orexin, which plays a major role in maintaining alertness. You can call it the alertness hormone.

How to manage this? Cut down on carbs, sub it with protein, reduce servings ideally. I skip lunch entirely and have breakfast and an early dinner. Haven't needed an afternoon nap unless really exhausted.","I would suggest avoiding sugar and carbs.

For breakfast and lunch, I go for low calorie meals high in protein and fiber with a little at. My breakfast during the week is a Quest bar, and my lunch varies but is usually something like a chicken soup, chili, meat and cheese (skip the crackers though), something like that. I'd also recommend spice for lunch. Eating something extremely spicy will help keep you alert. Peppers are really good for you, too.

The one exception is in the early summer when it's in season I like to have fresh fruit, especially berries, and whipped cream, because that is just one of my favorite things.

For dinner after you are mostly done being productive for the day is the time to eat your carbs.","Feeling sleepy after lunch is pretty common and can be due to a few reasons. It might be related to what you're eating. Meals high in carbs or sugar can cause a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash, making you feel tired. Try incorporating more protein and healthy fats into your lunch to see if that helps. Also, consider your portion sizes; eating too much can make you feel sluggish. 

Another thing to look at is your overall sleep quality and quantity. If you're not getting enough rest at night, it can make you more prone to afternoon drowsiness. 

Finally, try to get some light physical activity after eating, like a short walk. It can help boost your energy levels and keep you away from the bed. Building a habit of staying active after lunch might take some time, but consistency is key. Keep experimenting with these changes and see what works best for you!","This post-lunch sleepiness is actually really common - it's often called the ""post-lunch dip"" and happens due to a natural drop in your body's circadian rhythm combined with digestion taking up energy. The good news is there are several ways to manage this:

First, try adjusting what you eat for lunch. Large, carb-heavy meals tend to make this worse. Instead, opt for a balanced lunch with lean protein, vegetables, and complex carbs. Also, watch your portion size - overeating definitely increases that sleepy feeling.

Getting some movement right after lunch can make a huge difference. Even a 10-minute walk outside can help wake you up and boost your energy levels. The natural light exposure helps regulate your circadian rhythm too.

Stay hydrated throughout the day, especially around lunchtime. Sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration. Keep a water bottle at your desk and sip regularly.

If you still feel the need to rest, consider a proper power nap (15-20 minutes max) instead of lying in bed for an hour. Set an alarm and get up when it goes off. This can actually boost your afternoon productivity instead of derailing it.

The key is breaking the habit of going to your bed. Maybe rearrange your space so you're not working near your bed, or create a designated break area that's not your bedroom. Sometimes just changing your environment can help create new patterns.","It's pretty common to feel a slump after lunch, and there are a few possible reasons for it. One major contributor could be the natural dip in your body's circadian rhythm, which typically occurs in the early afternoon. Another factor might be the type of food you're eating for lunch - a big meal with lots of carbs or sugar can cause a spike in insulin levels, leading to feelings of lethargy. 

Try experimenting with your lunch routine to see if that makes a difference. You could attempt to eat smaller, more balanced meals, and avoid heavy foods that are high in sugar or salt. Additionally, getting some fresh air or taking a short walk after lunch might help increase your energy levels. It's also worth considering your sleep schedule and overall daily routine - are you getting enough sleep at night, and are you staying active throughout the day? Making adjustments to these habits could help reduce your afternoon fatigue. As for strategies to stay awake, you might find it helpful to change your environment after lunch, like moving to a different room or sitting outside, to break the association with your bed.","Hey, I totally get that afternoon slump. It's super common! A few things could be going on. First, it could be what you're eating for lunch. Big, heavy meals, especially those high in carbs, can cause a blood sugar spike and then a crash, leading to that sleepy feeling. Try experimenting with lighter lunches, maybe focusing on protein and veggies.

Also, consider your hydration. Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger or tiredness. Drink a glass of water right after lunch and see if that helps.

Finally, even a short burst of activity can make a difference. Instead of heading straight for bed, try a quick 10-15 minute walk after you eat. The fresh air and movement can really help combat that sluggishness. If you absolutely can't resist lying down, set a timer for *exactly* 20 minutes. That's enough for a power nap without getting into a deeper sleep cycle that will leave you feeling groggier. Good luck!

t3_ty38dt,[NEED ADVICE] i have no structure in my life and feel lost.,"i’m 19F, and i started university last year. 

I was in compulsory education from 5-18, so i was always following a strict routine of starting and ending school at the same times.
That created routine in my life, certain lessons on certain days, and the weekends.

But now that i’ve started university I realised how much discipline i LACK.
because no one is forcing me to attend, i barely do, and it’s ironic bc i’m PAYING for this.

Eventually i fell into a slump, in doors for days on end, no sunlight ( i live in the uk ☹️ ) and ghosting the people who cared about me. I became depressed, even my hobbies didn’t excite me.

My days blurred together, i didn’t feel the same, everything seemed to be going downhill.

i have since then acknowledged the problem and seeked help like getting counselling sessions through my uni, attending, hanging out w friends n going to the gym BUT every so often i fall back into the terrible sleep schedule, bad eating habits (i have an ED) and neglecting my academics. And having no structure in my life at all.


It frustrates me so much the lack of power and control i have over my own life. i feel as if all my days are one and i’m existing as opposed to living.

Please, leave some advice on how to create routine and build discipline .

Edit - 11th. Any 2023

Hey, so it took me a year but I came to the conclusion that I actually did have ADHD…. And I was diagnosed yesterday.
I didn’t believe I had it due to the lack of education on inattentive ADHD, and also being labelled as lazy a lot, when in reality I was struggling to operate in a world which doesn’t accommodate for people like me!

Anyway, I’m really glad that I wasn’t the problem, I feel bad for being so tough on myself. 
To all of the people who told me I might have had ADHD, I wish I listened to you earlier, and to those who related to me, please get checked out it will change your life.

In terms of a life update, I start my medication soon, on 30mg elvanse, I’m nervous but I’ll see how it goes.
My life has improved significantly, I started CBT therapy which kinda changed my life tbh.
I still struggle with my sleep but I’m going to be prescribe melatonin. 
I’m doing better with university, socially, emotionally, overall, it wasn’t my fault that I wasn’t ‘disciplined’ enough, I hope this helps someone’s out there if anyone sees this. 
never give up hope

 #advice","try and emulate the same routine you had in high school (waking up early and immediately going somewhere to study)

With your new ADHD diagnosis, it's great that you're starting medication and therapy, which can really help with focus and routine.

For building structure, try starting small. Pick one or two things to focus on each day, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating a specific time for studying. Use tools like planners or apps to keep track of your tasks and appointments. Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can make them feel less overwhelming.

Since you're in the UK and sunlight can be scarce, consider using a light therapy lamp to help regulate your sleep and mood. Also, keep nurturing your social connections and hobbies, as they can provide a sense of balance and joy.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Progress isn't always linear, and being kind to yourself is crucial. You're on the right path, and with time, you'll find a routine that works for you. Keep going, and never hesitate to reach out for support when you need it!","Congrats on getting your ADHD diagnosis - that's a huge step and explains so much of what you've been experiencing. It's great that you're starting medication soon and already seeing benefits from CBT therapy. Those are really positive developments.

Since you're still working on building structure with your new understanding of how your brain works, here are some ADHD-friendly suggestions:

Start super small with routines - pick just ONE consistent wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends. Your body clock needs that consistency. Use your phone's bedtime mode to help enforce this.

Break tasks into tiny chunks. Instead of ""study for 3 hours"", try ""read one page"" or ""write one paragraph."" The momentum often carries you further, but the small initial commitment makes it less overwhelming.

External accountability helps a lot - study groups, gym buddies, regular check-ins with friends. When motivation is variable (thanks ADHD!), having others expecting you helps bridge those gaps.

Most importantly - be patient with yourself as you figure out what works for YOUR brain. Some traditional productivity advice won't fit, and that's okay. Keep experimenting with different tools and systems until you find your groove.

The fact that you pursued answers and got help shows amazing self-advocacy. You've already made huge progress - now it's just fine-tuning with your new understanding of how your mind works.","It's amazing how far you've come in acknowledging your struggles and seeking help - that takes a lot of courage. Now that you've been diagnosed with ADHD, it's great that you're starting medication and CBT therapy, which can really help with structure and discipline. 

One thing that might be helpful is to start small and create a daily routine that works for you, taking into account your ADHD. Break down your day into manageable chunks, and prioritize tasks that are important to you, like attending university, spending time with friends, and self-care activities like going to the gym. You can also try using tools like planners, reminders, or apps to help stay organized and on track.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to have setbacks - it's not about being ""disciplined"" enough, but about finding systems and strategies that work for you. With your ADHD diagnosis, you might need to experiment with different techniques to find what helps you stay focused and motivated. 

Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've already made significant progress, and it's great that you're sharing your story to help others who may be struggling. Keep moving forward, and don't give up hope - you got this!","Hey, it sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's awesome that you've already taken steps like seeking counseling and reconnecting with friends. That's huge!

It's really common to struggle with structure when you go from a highly structured environment like school to the freedom of university. Don't beat yourself up too much about it.

Since you're already aware of the cycle you fall into, maybe try focusing on small, manageable changes. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, pick one thing to work on each week. For example, week one could be ""get sunlight every day,"" even if it's just sitting by a window for 15 minutes. Week two could be ""attend at least one class,"" and so on.

Also, since you mentioned your ED, make sure you're prioritizing your mental and physical health. Work closely with your counselor on strategies for managing those tough days. Maybe having a pre-planned meal schedule or a list of healthy snacks readily available could help prevent those bad eating habits from creeping back in.

Finally, remember that discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about showing up for yourself even when you don't feel like it. Be kind to yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward. You've got this!

EDIT: Wow, that's amazing news about your ADHD diagnosis! It's so validating to finally understand what's been going on. It's totally understandable that you were hard on yourself before, but now you can approach things with a new perspective and strategies that actually work for you. CBT therapy and medication can be game-changers. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you. So glad things are improving!

t3_xr5egr,"[Need Advice] Recovering from ""burnout""?","I put burnout in the quotes in the title because at this point I don't even think I can call it that anymore since quite a bit of time has passed.

Long story short, I was in a position doing something I used to love for over a decade. It was very stressful and busy work, lots of late nights and weekend hours along with normal business hours. Tried to make adjustments to make it tenable as I recognized burnout was likely coming if things didn't change, but obviously I didn't do enough.

A lot of the self-discipline I used to have fell by the wayside during that period. It was like mentally I lost the ability to keep up with anything outside of the bare minimum that allowed me to perform at my job.

I left that job 3 years ago. There are other things at play in the whole picture but I have been pretty much a wreck since then, and have not been able to bring myself to look for a job in that field since. The idea of it actually scares me. The issue is I don't really have any experience in other areas, so finding employment with a livable income has been nigh impossible and I am struggling to make ends meet.

As I'm typing this out, I'm thinking this is more than just a discipline issue but to be honest I'm not even sure what to look at to try to fix this.","Therapy. You learned that putting effort into things will hurt and still not be enough,  so you kicked off a protective mechanism that.... Isn't exactly helpful for people who can actually decide what to do. It's a bit complicated to dismantle,  so I recommend working with a professional","I came here to say that r/getdisciplined would be the wrong sub to get help, but looks like people here are very aware of the limitations of discipline. I'm in a similar situation as op, except I'm 25 and got burnout and an anxiety disorder 2 years ago. Therapy, online sources like [healthygamer.gg](https://healthygamer.gg) or books by psychology experts seem to be the best directions for op.","Hey there! It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck. First off, it's okay to acknowledge that this is more than just a discipline issue—sometimes life throws us curveballs that require a broader approach. Here are a few steps that might help you get back on track:

1. **Start Small**: Rebuilding discipline can begin with small, manageable habits. Pick one thing you want to improve, like a daily walk or a set bedtime, and focus on that. Consistency is key, even if it feels insignificant at first.

2. **Explore New Interests**: Since returning to your old field feels daunting, consider exploring new areas that interest you. Online courses or volunteering can be great ways to gain experience and confidence without the pressure of a full-time job.

3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break down your goals into smaller, achievable tasks. This can help reduce overwhelm and give you a sense of accomplishment as you tick things off your list.

4. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out for support, whether it's from friends, family, or a professional. Sometimes an outside perspective can provide clarity and motivation.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, recovery and growth take time. Celebrate small victories and be patient with yourself as you navigate this journey.

You've already taken a big step by reaching out for advice, and that's commendable. Keep moving forward, one step at a time. You've got this!","You're right that this goes beyond just discipline - it sounds like you experienced some serious career trauma that's still affecting you. That's completely understandable after a decade of intense burnout.

The good news is you can rebuild your discipline and career confidence gradually. Start really small - pick one tiny habit to focus on for the next week. It could be making your bed each morning, a 5-minute meditation, or just drinking water when you wake up. The specific habit matters less than proving to yourself you can stick to something manageable.

For the career piece, consider exploring adjacent fields where your existing skills would transfer well. You don't have to jump right back into the exact same role. What aspects of your previous work did you genuinely enjoy before burnout set in? Those elements could point toward alternative paths that feel less threatening.

In the meantime, work on building a sustainable daily routine. Add structure back into your days bit by bit. Once you have some basic habits locked in, you'll likely feel more equipped to tackle bigger challenges like the job search.

Don't hesitate to talk to a career counselor or therapist if you can access one. They can help you process what happened and develop strategies for moving forward. Burnout recovery takes time, but you've already taken the crucial first step of recognizing you want things to change.","It sounds like you've been through a really tough time and are still feeling the effects of burnout, even years after leaving your job. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the need for change and are willing to work on rebuilding your self-discipline. That in itself is a huge step forward. 

Given your situation, it might be helpful to start small and focus on building habits outside of your career. Try to identify one or two areas where you'd like to see improvement, such as exercise, reading, or cooking, and set super achievable goals for yourself. This could be as simple as taking a 10-minute walk each day or dedicating 30 minutes to a hobby. As you start to build momentum in these areas, you can begin to translate that discipline into other parts of your life, like job searching or exploring new career paths.

It's also important to consider seeking out resources that can help you navigate this transition. Have you thought about reaching out to a career counselor or a therapist who can help you work through your fears and anxieties about returning to your old field or exploring new ones? They may be able to offer valuable guidance and support as you work to get back on your feet.

Lastly, don't underestimate the value of taking care of yourself during this time. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Remember that rebuilding your life and your sense of discipline takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's totally understandable that your discipline took a hit. Three years is a long time to feel stuck, but it's definitely not too late to start rebuilding.

First, be kind to yourself. You went through a high-stress situation for a long time. It's okay that you're not back to ""normal"" yet.

Regarding discipline, start small. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once. Pick *one* tiny habit you want to build. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, going for a 15-minute walk, or spending 30 minutes job searching. The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Consistency is way more important than intensity at this stage.

Since the thought of your old field scares you, maybe explore adjacent skills or roles. Could you leverage your existing knowledge in a less stressful environment, or in a slightly different capacity? Even informational interviews with people in related fields could give you some ideas and help you feel less intimidated.

Finally, you mentioned this might be more than just a discipline issue, and you're probably right. If possible, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process the burnout and develop coping mechanisms for the anxiety you're feeling about returning to work. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. Good luck, you got this!

t3_zs03uo,[Need Advice] I still live with my mom at 26. I have been trying to earn my independence but I feel like I’m on a treadmill. What do I need to change?,"I (26f) still live with my mother (57f). I’m working on becoming independent but I’m doing something wrong because it’s not getting me anywhere. What is my problem? 

I’m so ashamed of how behind I am in life and how immature and dependent I am. I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. 

My mom doesn’t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it’s been many many years (10+).

I also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out. I also paid my tuition for one class at a local college. she still pays for my groceries and phone. I’m so embarrassed. 

She doesn’t want me to move out because she says I’m incapable of functioning and I’m trying to prove both of us wrong. I do housework, try to clean up after both of us, help her whenever I can, but I’m still basically a child and I hate myself for being so behind. 

I’m grateful, don’t get me wrong, but I’m incredibly ashamed of what it says about me that I am where I am in life.

What am I doing wrong? Should I quit school? Should I just try to find better/more work? Or is it stupid to work shitty jobs without a degree. Should I get independence or a degree first?","I think you would experience less day-to-day stress if you simply let go of the narrative that you need to have it all figured out by now. You’re doing great. Just keep doing your best at whatever you set your mind to and maintain a growth mindset. You are already enough. Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma. Keep displaying the courage it takes to be vulnerable, like you did by sharing your story, and it will inspire those around you to do the same. Remember, you don’t need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm!","I would get a job in construction. It's full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.

You can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.

She sounds toxic by telling you that you can't function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.

Construction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.","Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone's journey is different, and it's great that you're actively seeking ways to improve your situation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

1. **Job Situation**: Since your hours were reduced, it's smart that you're looking for additional part-time work. Keep applying and consider jobs that might offer more hours or better pay. Even if they're not in your ideal field, they can help you save up and gain more independence.

2. **Education**: If you can manage it financially and time-wise, continuing with your class is a good idea. Education can open doors, but it doesn't have to be a full-time commitment right now. Maybe look into online courses or certifications that are affordable and can boost your skills.

3. **Budgeting**: Try to track your expenses and see if there are areas where you can save more. Every little bit helps when you're working towards moving out.

4. **Communication with Your Mom**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your mom about your goals and how she can support you in becoming more independent. Maybe there's a way to gradually take on more responsibilities that can help prove your capability.

5. **Self-Compassion**: Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be where you are. Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and celebrate the progress you make along the way.

Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!","First off - you're not ""behind in life."" There's no universal timeline, especially given how expensive housing has become. Many people in their 20s live with family while building towards independence.

That said, it sounds like your current situation isn't healthy. Your mom telling you you're ""incapable of functioning"" is concerning and likely affecting your confidence. The fact that you're working, studying, doing housework, and actively trying to improve shows you ARE capable.

Here's what I suggest:

Make a clear financial plan. Track every dollar you spend and earn. The $500 you're paying for storage could be going towards your own place or more classes. Talk to your mom about selling that stuff or finding a cheaper storage solution.

Don't quit school, but do look for full-time work. Many companies offer tuition assistance - this could help you take more classes. A degree generally leads to better opportunities, but you can work on both simultaneously.

Start building your independence in steps. Open your own phone plan. Take over your grocery expenses. Each small step builds confidence and practical skills. Look for roommate situations - this can make rent much more manageable while you're getting established.

Most importantly, recognize that you're already taking positive steps. Working part-time, studying, and actively seeking solutions are all signs of someone who's capable and motivated. Keep building on that momentum, but be strategic about where you put your energy and resources.

Focus on what you can control and change today, rather than feeling ashamed about the past. You've got this.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, but the fact that you're recognizing your situation and wanting to make changes is a huge step. First, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to live with their parents into their 20s or even 30s, especially with the rising costs of living. 

It seems like you have a few different goals competing for priority - becoming independent, finishing your education, and finding better work. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe focus on making progress in one area at a time. For example, you could try to increase your income by taking on more hours or finding a better-paying job, which would give you more financial stability and autonomy. 

It might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your goals and aspirations. It's possible that she's not aware of how her comments are affecting you, and talking it through could help clear the air and give you a better understanding of each other's perspectives.

As for whether to prioritize independence or education, it's not necessarily an either-or situation. You could try to find ways to balance both, like taking online classes or finding a job that offers tuition reimbursement. And it's definitely not stupid to work ""shitty jobs"" without a degree - many people have to start at the bottom and work their way up, and having some kind of income can give you the freedom to pursue other opportunities.

Remember that becoming independent is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're already taking classes and paying your mom rent, which shows that you're capable of taking care of yourself to some extent. Try to focus on making progress rather than beating yourself up over what you perceive as shortcomings. You got this, and it's never too late to make changes and start moving in a direction that feels more fulfilling to you.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're actively trying to change things is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much; everyone's journey is different.

First, let's tackle the immediate issue: independence. It seems like you're stuck in a cycle where your mom's expectations are holding you back. You need a clear, actionable plan to break free.

I wouldn't necessarily quit school *entirely*, but maybe scale back to focus on work for a bit. One class is manageable, but if it's a huge stressor, consider pausing. The goal is to get some financial breathing room.

Prioritize finding better/more work. ""Shitty"" jobs aren't stupid if they're a stepping stone. Look for opportunities with potential for growth or skills development, even if they're not glamorous. Think about what skills you have or can easily learn (customer service, data entry, etc.) and target those areas. Temp agencies can be a good way to get your foot in the door.

Create a detailed budget. Track every penny coming in and going out. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and where you can cut back. It will also help you set realistic savings goals.

Start small with savings. Even $25 a week adds up. The key is consistency. Automate it if you can, so it happens without you having to think about it.

Talk to your mom. Have an honest conversation about your goals and your need for independence. Set clear boundaries and expectations. This might be difficult, but it's crucial. Explain that you appreciate her help, but you need to learn to stand on your own two feet. Maybe even propose a timeline for moving out, even if it's a year or two down the road.

As for the storage unit situation, that's a tricky one. Maybe suggest helping her list some of the items online to generate some extra income. It could be a win-win.

Ultimately, it's about taking small, consistent steps towards your goals. Focus on building your financial stability first, then revisit the degree question later. You've got this!

Need some advice if anyone have done this, it would be a big help.",Keep applying. Business /youtube is much harder than you think. Not demotivating. Went through the same path. Make changes in your resume and follow up with HRs.,I stand corrected,"Starting a business or a YouTube channel can be a great way to channel your energy and creativity, especially if you're feeling stuck with job applications. Here are a few tips to help you get started and stay disciplined:

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what success looks like for your business or channel. Is it a certain number of subscribers, a specific revenue target, or something else? Having clear goals will keep you focused and motivated.

2. **Create a Schedule**: Consistency is key, especially with online ventures. Set a realistic schedule for creating content or working on your business, and stick to it. This will help you build momentum and establish a routine.

3. **Start Small**: You mentioned having minimal capital, so start with what you have. For a YouTube channel, focus on content quality over expensive equipment. For a business, consider low-cost or digital products/services to minimize initial expenses.

4. **Learn Continuously**: There are tons of free resources online to help you learn about entrepreneurship and content creation. Dedicate time each week to learn something new that can help you improve and grow.

5. **Stay Patient and Persistent**: Success won't happen overnight. There will be challenges and setbacks, but staying disciplined and persistent will help you overcome them. Celebrate small wins along the way to keep your spirits up.

Remember, whether it's a job or a new venture, the key is to keep moving forward. Good luck!","Job hunting can be really draining, so it's understandable you're looking at alternatives. Starting a business or YouTube channel could work, but they typically take longer to generate income than finding a job. Here's what I'd suggest:

Don't completely abandon the job search - instead, treat it like a part-time commitment while you explore these other options. Set aside maybe 1-2 hours each day for applications and use the rest of your time to develop your business/content ideas.

For the business route: Start by researching your market and creating a solid plan. What specific problem will you solve? Who are your customers? What's your competitive advantage? Even with minimal capital, you need a clear strategy.

For YouTube: Pick a specific niche you're knowledgeable about and passionate for. The platform is saturated, but there's always room for quality content. Start creating videos while you still have time - this way you'll build skills and possibly an audience before fully committing.

The key is to maintain structure. Set specific daily goals for both your job search and side project development. Maybe ""2 job applications + 1 hour of business planning"" or ""3 applications + 2 hours of video content creation."" This keeps you moving forward on multiple fronts without getting overwhelmed.

Remember: successful businesses and YouTube channels rarely provide immediate income. Having a steady job while building these up is often the most practical approach.","It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the job search process and are looking to explore alternative paths. Starting a business or creating content online can be a great way to take control of your career, but it's essential to approach these ventures with a clear plan and realistic expectations. Before diving in, consider what skills you can leverage, what problems you're passionate about solving, or what topics you're knowledgeable about that could attract an audience. For YouTube, consistency and patience are key, as building an audience takes time. For a business, even with minimal capital, understanding your target market and having a solid business model is crucial. Have you considered taking some online courses or attending webinars to learn more about entrepreneurship or content creation? This could help you make a more informed decision and give you a foundation to build upon. What specific areas are you thinking of focusing on with your potential business or YouTube channel?","Hey, job hunting burnout is real, so it's understandable you're looking at other options. Starting a business or a YouTube channel can be cool, but both take serious discipline to get off the ground.

Before diving in, maybe try breaking down the job search into smaller, more manageable chunks. Set a daily goal of applying to, say, 3 jobs, and really focus on tailoring your application to each one. That way, you're still in the game but not feeling overwhelmed.

As for the business/YouTube route, think about what you're genuinely passionate about and what problem you can solve for people. Then, research like crazy. See what others are doing, what works, and what doesn't. Start small, set realistic goals (like posting one video a week or getting your first 5 customers), and celebrate the small wins. Consistency is key, and that's where the discipline comes in. Good luck!

t3_xekzu4,[Need Advice] I often wallow in self-pity/self-hatred and it's ruining my life. How do I stop this?,"I'm really hard on myself. Yet even though I'm hard on myself it rarely manifests in any meaningful change in my life. Rather I just wallow in these feelings and it has been like this for years now.

Whenever I try to pursue a goal, I'm my own worse enemy and it feels like I self sabotage a lot. I try to set goals yet it seems like I never reach them. And when I fail to reach these goals I'm quick to rationalize why I failed and move on.

How do I put these emotions of doubt/self-hatred/self-pity to the side and ignore them. I'm tired of always doubting myself and never finishing a goal I make. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.","You’re thinking too much. It’s tough not to do that. I encourage you read The Power of Now. I also enjoyed Atomic Habits. If you struggle reading then listen to the audiobook.

Keep your focus on the moment and the task at hand. 

Also, the deeper you breathe the quieter your mind becomes. Focus on your breath as often as is practical.","Also maybe try The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery.
Its about changing the way you think, being mindful of your thoughts much like Cognitive Behavioural Thearapy. CBT really helped me out and is great if you cant afford therapy. I'd recommend learning about it, theres lots of great lectures on youtube.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out for advice is a great first step. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on building momentum. Instead of setting big goals that feel overwhelming, try breaking them down into tiny, manageable steps. Celebrate each small win, no matter how minor it seems. This can help build confidence and create a positive feedback loop.

Also, consider reframing how you talk to yourself. When you catch yourself being overly critical, try to counter it with a more compassionate perspective. Ask yourself what you'd say to a friend in the same situation. Practicing self-compassion can gradually shift your mindset from self-sabotage to self-support.

Lastly, it might be helpful to keep a journal. Writing down your thoughts can help you process emotions and track your progress. Over time, you'll likely notice patterns and areas where you can make adjustments. Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!","The key is to start treating yourself like someone you're responsible for helping, rather than an enemy to criticize. Self-criticism rarely leads to positive change - it just creates a cycle of guilt and avoidance.

Instead of setting big goals that feel overwhelming, break things down into tiny, almost laughably small steps. Want to exercise? Start with just putting on your workout clothes. Want to study? Open the book for 5 minutes. The smaller the better.

When you complete these micro-steps, actively acknowledge it. Not with harsh judgment of ""this isn't enough,"" but with a simple ""I did what I planned to do."" Over time, these small wins build momentum and confidence.

For the self-sabotage pattern, try this: When you notice those thoughts coming up, don't fight them or try to ignore them. Just observe them like you're watching clouds pass by. ""Oh, there's that doubt again."" Then gently redirect your focus back to your tiny next step.

The path to discipline isn't about being perfect or never failing. It's about being consistent with small actions and treating yourself with the same patience you'd extend to a friend who's learning something new. Your past attempts weren't failures - they were practice rounds that taught you what doesn't work for you.

Pick one small thing to do today. Just one. Do it, acknowledge it, and build from there. You've already shown courage by reaching out for help - that's a positive step right there.","It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-criticism that's holding you back from making progress towards your goals. One thing that might help is to practice self-compassion - instead of beating yourself up over your failures, try to treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and has setbacks, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. 

When you start to feel those feelings of self-pity or self-hatred creeping in, try to acknowledge them without judgment, and then gently refocus on the present moment. Ask yourself what small, concrete step you can take right now to move closer to your goal. Break down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks, and celebrate your successes along the way - no matter how tiny they may seem.

It's also important to recognize that self-sabotage often stems from fear of failure or fear of success. Try to identify what might be driving your self-sabotaging behaviors, and address those underlying fears. Remember that progress is rarely linear, and it's okay to stumble sometimes. The key is to learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.

Lastly, consider seeking out accountability and support - whether it's a friend, family member, or therapist - to help you stay on track and work through these challenging emotions. You don't have to do this alone, and having someone in your corner can make a big difference in your journey towards developing discipline and achieving your goals.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you're stuck in a loop of high expectations, followed by failure, then self-criticism, and rationalization. Here's a thought: maybe the goals you're setting are too big to start with.

Instead of trying to overhaul your life overnight, try focusing on *tiny*, achievable steps. Seriously, ridiculously small. Like, ""I will do 5 minutes of [desired activity] today."" The point isn't the activity itself at first, it's building the habit of *actually finishing* something you set out to do.

When you catch yourself rationalizing failure, try to reframe it. Instead of ""I failed because [excuse],"" try ""Okay, that didn't work. What's one tiny thing I can adjust next time?"" Focus on the process, not the outcome. Celebrate the small wins. Each tiny success is a brick in the wall you're building.

Also, consider journaling. When you feel the self-pity/hatred creeping in, write it down. Get it out of your head and onto paper. Sometimes just seeing it written down makes it seem less overwhelming. You might even start to see patterns in your thinking that you can challenge. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13aaa4q,[Need Advice] I am pretty hardworking at work but once I'm at home I don't do anything.,"bosses frequently give me praise for being hard working at my job but once I'm at home I dont do anything. I have trash everywhere in my apartment, my sheets came off and i haven't been bothered to fix them. dishes have piled up everywhere and i just dont seem to care enough to fix anything. Even if i do get it together and clean it up it always returns to that stte in a few weeks i can never keep it constantly clean.

In my free time/ days off all i do is either watch YouTube/browse reddit or just lay down and daydream. I've tried for ages to do all the traditional advice I even went on a months long hike to get outside and away from technology but it didnt work I didn't enjoy it that much and im right back where i started now that it's over.

I bought a ps5 the other week since i though if im not going to do anything i might as well have fun but nothing captured my interest i haven't played it at all.

Ive been diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorders and have been on and off of medication for the past 6 years. Im currently on my 7th antidepressants on maximum dose and it again doesn't seem to be doing anything. Ive tried therapist before but they are expense and never seem to help.",Incorporate listening to YouTube while you clean. It’s very energizing and motivating. I have a YouTube song list. I also enjoy listening to Audiobooks and Podcasts (mostly self help genre),"-I love all the books by author Karen Casey (recovering alcoholic who gives advice on how to live a peaceful life, overcome co-dependency, taking small steps to a better life)


-Sink Reflections by Marla Cilley (she’s the Fly Lady who teaches you how to keep a clean/tidy house. Her book is fantastic; I’m not a fan of her website which originally is what made her well known)


-30 Days: Change Your Habits Change Your Life by Marc Reklau (this one is so good that I started to listen a second time with pen and paper to take notes)


-Mindful Self-Discipline by Giovanni Dienstmann (looong, but so enjoyable and written by a self-discipline/meditation coach)

Currently, I’m listening to How to do the Work by Dr. Nicole LePera. I’m enjoying it, but not sure yet if I’d include it on the list.

Edit to add: if I were to put the books in order of favorites, I would put Fly Lady last","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable that maintaining discipline at home feels challenging. One approach that might help is starting small and building from there. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one small task each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or washing a few dishes. The key is consistency, not perfection. Over time, these small wins can build momentum and make the larger tasks feel more manageable.

Also, consider setting a specific time for these tasks, like 10 minutes after you get home. Creating a routine can help shift your mindset from work mode to home mode. Since you've mentioned that traditional advice hasn't worked, maybe try incorporating something you enjoy into your routine, like listening to a favorite podcast or music while you clean.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to have days where things don't go as planned. Progress isn't always linear, and every small step counts. If therapy hasn't been helpful in the past, maybe exploring different types of therapy or support groups could offer new perspectives. You're not alone in this, and reaching out here is already a positive step.","It sounds like you're experiencing burnout from giving all your energy to work, leaving nothing in the tank for your personal life. This is actually pretty common - our brains have limited willpower each day, and you're spending most of it at your job.

The key is to start really small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE tiny habit to build first - something that takes 2 minutes or less. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, or washing one dish right after you use it. The goal isn't to transform your apartment overnight, it's to prove to yourself that you can stick to something small.

For the motivation piece - your brain might be understimulated at home compared to work. Try setting a timer for just 10 minutes when you get home and tackle one small area. Put on some music or a podcast while you do it. Sometimes just getting started is the hardest part, but movement creates momentum.

Given your PDD diagnosis, please don't beat yourself up about this. It's great that you're actively trying different solutions. While therapy is expensive, many areas have sliding scale options or support groups that could help. Your current medication doesn't seem optimal either - it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor.

Remember: tiny steps, one habit at a time, and be patient with yourself. You've already shown you can be disciplined at work - now it's just about redirecting some of that energy homeward in small, manageable chunks.","It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a disconnect between your work life and personal life, where the discipline and motivation you have at work isn't translating to your home life. Given your history with Persistent Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorders, it's not surprising that traditional advice hasn't been sticking. 

One thing you might consider is starting small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one tiny habit you'd like to build, like making your bed as soon as you get up or washing one dish after each meal. These tiny wins can add up over time and help build momentum. It's also worth exploring ways to make cleaning and organization more manageable, like breaking tasks into smaller chunks or finding a cleaning routine that works for you.

It's great that you've been open to trying new things, even if they haven't worked out - the hike, the PS5, etc. Sometimes it takes a bit of experimentation to find what actually resonates with us. Have you considered exploring other hobbies or activities that might bring you joy and help you feel more engaged at home? Maybe there's something creative, like drawing or writing, or something practical, like cooking or gardening, that could help you find some purpose and motivation.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to deal with medication and therapy not seeming to work, especially when it feels like you've tried everything. If you feel comfortable, it might be worth talking to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan or exploring other options - sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right combination of things that work for us. Keep in mind that building discipline and habits is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's awesome that you're reaching out. It's really common to feel drained after work, especially when you're giving it your all. Don't beat yourself up too much about the apartment situation – it happens.

Since you've tried some bigger changes like the hike and they didn't stick, maybe try breaking things down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of aiming for a spotless apartment, could you commit to just washing one dish after each meal? Or making your bed every other day? The goal is to build momentum, not perfection.

Also, it might be worth revisiting your doctor or psychiatrist about your medication. Since you've been on so many different ones without much success, there might be other options or approaches to explore. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right fit.

As for the free time, instead of trying to force yourself into hobbies, maybe just experiment with different things for 15-20 minutes each day. See if anything sparks your interest, even if it's just a little bit. It could be anything from drawing to learning a new language to trying a new recipe. The key is to keep it low-pressure and fun. Good luck, you got this!

t3_xtypkg,"[Need advice] I'm a 26 year old failure and I don't know what to do anymore, I cannot decide to pick my major in college..","Everyone seems to be doing STEM major or something related to tech or technology wise. Because it’s in demand for the future. They pay very well and it’s a stable future growth.

As a kid, I wasn’t interested in technology like fixing computers or learning hacks or tricks. I’m sorta regretting my current studies for radiology tech. I’m not sure if this is meant for me. I truly don’t know what to do and I’m completely lose feeling overwhelmed and not doing anything makes my time waste. I’m falling behind.

I don’t know who to reach out or ways to network people in technology field. I need help","First of all - you’re 26, you can still change what you want to do or be. Many times. You’re good. I don’t mean that to sound condescending but it’s generally true. Do you have access to a guidance counsellor - career coach or just a friend who is good to chat this over with? Think about what you enjoy and what you’re good at and how they might intercept to form a career? Good luck.","Since you're in college, I would recommend using all the resources that they have available to help you find direction.  If there's a guidance counselor equivalent, I would start with them.  If you have some inkling of different directions you'd potentially like to explore, I would bring these up as well as your concerns.  They may not have answers, but they potentially can point you in the direction of people who may be able to help you.  Another avenue that you might want to consider is the mental health counselors.  Most of the time they are free, and they can also assist you determine what goals are important to you and how you can go about achieving those goals while filtering out the stuff that isn't helping.  Another route that you could check out would be a mentor.  Some colleges have alumni in all walks of life who volunteer their time to help mentor current students.  They can give insight based on their experiences and help you to build out your network.  Your school may also have vocational tests available that you can take that might bring something to light that you hadn't considered in the past, and give you an opportunity to explore, also using the resources available at the school.

As for the RT program specifically, see if you can shadow at a local hospital in the various areas that your degree will apply to.  Being a radiology tech gives you a potential career path in a number of areas of the hospital that you may find interesting.  Some of the procedure areas, like Cath Lab, Interventional Radiology, Electrophysiology, Interventional Neurology, and Structural Heart (to name a few) employ RTs to assist the physician during the procedures.  Spending two or three hours shadowing and observing may give you a new perspective on your degree and help you find a more focused path to follow.  Or, it could end up definitively showing you that it's not the direction you want to go, which is also a good thing to find out.

Good luck!","Hey there! First off, it's totally okay to feel uncertain about your path—many people go through this. It sounds like you're feeling pressured to follow a trend, but remember, your career should align with your interests and strengths. If radiology tech isn't clicking for you, it might be worth exploring other fields that excite you. 

Start by identifying what you enjoy or are curious about. It doesn't have to be tech if that's not your thing. Once you have a few ideas, try to learn more about them through online courses, workshops, or even volunteering. This can help you make a more informed decision about your major.

Networking can feel daunting, but it doesn't have to be. Join online communities related to your interests, attend local meetups, or connect with alumni from your college. People are often willing to share their experiences and advice.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to take time to figure things out. Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and you'll build momentum over time. You've got this!","First off - you're not a failure at 26. Many people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and feeling uncertain about your path is completely normal.

Regarding radiology tech vs. tech careers - remember that ""tech"" is an incredibly broad field. Not everyone in tech started by taking apart computers as a kid. Many successful people in tech discovered their interest later in life.

That said, don't feel pressured to switch to tech just because others are doing it or because of the salary potential. Radiology tech is also a solid career with good prospects. The healthcare field isn't going anywhere, and imaging technology keeps advancing.

If you want to explore tech, start small. Take a free online course in programming basics through Coursera or freeCodeCamp. Join local tech meetups - they're usually welcoming to beginners and great for networking. LinkedIn can also help you connect with people in tech fields.

The key is to take action while maintaining your current studies. Set aside 1-2 hours a few times a week to explore tech. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether to switch fields, rather than making a rushed choice based on FOMO.

Remember: success isn't about racing others to a finish line. It's about finding work that aligns with your interests and abilities. Take it one step at a time, and focus on learning rather than comparing yourself to others.","It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to choose a major that's ""in demand"" but at the same time, you're not sure if it's really what you want to do. First, let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to not have it all figured out right now. You're 26, and many people change careers or majors multiple times throughout their lives.

Rather than trying to follow the crowd into STEM fields just because they're in demand, why not try to explore what actually interests you? What are your hobbies or passions outside of school? Are there any subjects that you've enjoyed learning about in the past, even if they're not necessarily ""practical""?

It might also be helpful to talk to a career counselor or academic advisor who can help you explore different options and find a major that aligns with your strengths and interests. And don't worry too much about ""wasting time"" - taking a little extra time to figure out what you want to do can actually save you time and energy in the long run.

As for networking, you don't necessarily need to know people in the tech field to get started. You could try attending career fairs or industry events, joining online communities or forums related to your interests, or even just reaching out to people on LinkedIn who work in fields that you're curious about. Remember, it's okay to start small and take things one step at a time - you don't need to have it all figured out right now.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not alone. A lot of people feel pressured to follow the STEM/tech path, and it's easy to feel lost when you're not sure it's right for you.

First, take a breath. You're 26, not a failure. It's okay to re-evaluate your path. Radiology tech is a valuable field, but if it's not clicking, it's worth exploring other options.

Instead of focusing on what *everyone else* is doing, try to pinpoint what *you* enjoy and what you're good at. What subjects did you like in high school? What activities make you lose track of time? Think about the problems you like solving. This can give you clues about potential career paths.

As for networking in tech, start small. Look for online communities related to specific areas of tech that interest you (even if it's just a little bit). Subreddits, Discord servers, online forums – these are great places to lurk, learn, and eventually ask questions. You don't need to be a coding whiz to participate. Just show genuine curiosity.

Also, don't be afraid to reach out to people on LinkedIn. Find people in tech roles that sound interesting and send them a polite message asking for an informational interview. Most people are happy to share their experiences.

Finally, remember that discipline isn't about forcing yourself to do something you hate. It's about building habits that support your goals. Start with small, manageable steps. Maybe it's spending 30 minutes a day exploring different career options or joining one online tech community. The key is consistency. You got this!

I need to stay informed on what's going on in the world 

I need to learn how buying a house works

There's just so much stuff I need to learn and I never start because more and more gets added to the list in my head.",Wallstreetbets have no idea what they’re talking about,What a good subreddit for that stuff then? Preferably one where the user base isn’t using derogatory language,"Hey there! It sounds like you've got a lot on your plate, but the good news is that you don't have to tackle everything at once. Start by prioritizing what's most important to you right now. Pick one or two areas to focus on first. For example, if figuring out a career is a top priority, dedicate some time each day to exploring different fields, networking, or taking relevant courses. 

For social skills, practice makes perfect. Try joining groups or activities where you can meet new people in a low-pressure environment. As for working out, start small. Even a 10-minute daily routine can build momentum. 

Remember, it's okay to not know everything at once. Learning is a lifelong journey. Break things down into manageable steps, and celebrate small wins along the way. You've got this!","Hey there - I totally get that overwhelming feeling when looking at a big list of things to learn. The key is to not try tackling everything at once. Instead, pick just 1-2 things to focus on for the next month.

Looking at your list, I'd suggest starting with the workout routine since it's concrete and will boost your confidence/energy for tackling other goals. Pick a simple program like Couch to 5K or Starting Strength and commit to following it 3x per week for one month. That's it - just that one goal.

For month two, keep the workout habit going and add ONE more focus area. Maybe that's starting to learn about investing basics (the WSB stuff) through r/personalfinance. Or working on social skills by joining a local sports league or hobby group.

The point is to build sustainable habits one at a time rather than trying to transform everything at once. As you master each new skill or habit, you can gradually add more while maintaining what you've already built.

Also worth noting - you don't need to learn everything perfectly. For things like house buying, you can learn the basics when you actually need them. Focus first on the skills that will improve your daily life (fitness, career, social confidence).

Start small, be consistent, and trust that steady progress adds up over time. You've got this!","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by all the things you want to learn and improve on, which is completely understandable. One strategy that might help is to prioritize your goals and focus on one or two areas at a time. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, ask yourself what's most important to you right now. Is it figuring out a career path or improving your social skills? Start with that one thing and break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if you want to learn how to converse with men like an average guy, you could start by listening to podcasts or watching videos on the topic, then practice with a friend or family member. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at everything, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You might also consider setting aside a specific time each day or week to learn something new, whether that's reading about current events, working on your math skills, or researching how to buy a house. By focusing on one thing at a time and making progress incrementally, you can start to feel more in control of your goals and less overwhelmed by the sheer number of things you want to learn.","Okay, I get it. That's a lot on your plate, and it's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed. The key is to break it down and not try to tackle everything at once.

First, prioritize. What's the *most* important thing right now? Figuring out a career? Okay, then focus on *that* for the next week or two. Just career stuff. Forget the rest for now.

For the career, don't think ""I need to figure out a career."" Think ""I need to spend 30 minutes researching potential careers I might be interested in."" Small, manageable steps. Then, ""I need to spend 30 minutes researching the skills needed for one of those careers."" See?

Once you've made some progress on the career front, *then* pick something else. Maybe the workout routine. Again, small steps. ""I need to find a 15-minute beginner workout video on YouTube."" Do that. Then do it again tomorrow.

The other stuff, like social skills and WallStreetBets, can be sprinkled in as you have time and energy. Maybe listen to a podcast about investing while you're working out. Maybe try making one small joke in a conversation each day.

The biggest thing is to be kind to yourself. You're not going to become an expert in everything overnight. Just focus on making small, consistent progress, one step at a time. And celebrate those small wins! They add up. Good luck!

And now university exams are starting and I know I won't make it to good college this year. So I asked my parents for 1 year drop study and they accepted. BUT the problem is I completely lack discipline and I am afraid I will waste this year too if I don't change something. I want to change.

Please give me advice how do I discipline myself.","Ok let's put this in perspective, you are 17 and short of a major felony or crippling injury you have not fucked your life up.  Melodrama is fun but not productive.  

Here is a great motivational tool, get a hard job.  If you do hard work for a year or so you will figure out that college is easy, safe and out of the sun.  A good place to be","As someone who's in college let me tell ya, 3/4 years is a looooong time and you change so much during the years. Not everydays the same some days suck some days are good. But you live and you learn! Your past does not define you! Everydays a chance to reinvent yourself!","Hey! It's great that you're recognizing the need for change and are willing to take a year to focus on improving. Here are a few steps to help you build discipline:

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Start by defining what you want to achieve during this year. Break it down into smaller, manageable goals. This will give you a clear direction and make it easier to track your progress.

2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a daily schedule that includes time for studying, breaks, and other activities. Consistency is key to building discipline, so try to stick to your routine as much as possible.

3. **Start Small**: Begin with small, achievable tasks to build momentum. Completing these tasks will boost your confidence and help you develop a habit of discipline.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times for social media or finding a quiet place to study.

5. **Stay Accountable**: Share your goals with someone you trust, like a friend or family member, who can help keep you accountable. You might also consider joining a study group or finding a study buddy.

6. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly review your progress and be open to adjusting your approach if something isn’t working. It's okay to make changes as you learn what works best for you.

Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep moving forward. You've got this!","Hey there - taking a gap year can be a really smart move, but you're right that having a solid plan is crucial. The good news is that recognizing you need to build discipline is already a huge first step.

Start small. Pick one consistent wake-up time and stick to it every day, even weekends. This will help regulate your daily rhythm and make other habits easier to build. Set an alarm and put it across the room so you have to get up.

Create a basic daily schedule that includes dedicated study blocks. Start with just 2-3 hours total, broken into 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks. As this becomes routine, gradually increase the time. The key is consistency over intensity at first.

Get an accountability system in place now, before the year starts. This could mean:
- Finding a study buddy who's also preparing for exams
- Using a habit tracking app and sharing progress with your parents
- Joining online study groups
- Setting weekly check-ins with a teacher or mentor

Most importantly, treat this year like a job. Have a designated study space that's not your bedroom, get dressed properly each morning, and maintain regular hours. This mindset shift helps create the structure you need.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track quickly when you slip up. Start implementing these changes now, while you're still in school, so you can hit the ground running during your gap year.

You've got this. The fact that you're asking for help shows you're serious about making changes. Take it one day at a time, and focus on building sustainable habits rather than trying to transform everything overnight.","Taking a year to focus on yourself and your habits can be a great opportunity for growth, but it's awesome that you're aware of the potential pitfalls and wanting to make a change. To start building discipline, I'd recommend setting clear, achievable goals for what you want to accomplish during this gap year - not just academically, but also personally. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks and create a schedule to help you stay on track. It might also be helpful to establish a daily routine that includes time blocks for studying, self-care, and activities that bring you joy. Consider finding an accountability partner or mentor who can support and motivate you along the way. Additionally, you could try using the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work + 5 minutes of break - to help you stay focused and avoid burnout. Remember, discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly, so start small and be patient with yourself as you work towards developing new habits. What specific areas do you think you need to work on the most during this gap year?","Hey, it's awesome that you're recognizing this now and wanting to make a change. A year to focus on studying is a great opportunity, but you're right, discipline is key.

First, break down that year into smaller, manageable chunks. Don't just think ""a year of studying."" Think ""this week I'm going to focus on X chapter of Y subject."" Small wins build momentum.

Second, build a routine, and stick to it as much as possible. Wake up at the same time, study at the same time, take breaks at the same time. Consistency is huge for building discipline. Even if you don't feel like it, just showing up and doing *something* is better than nothing.

Third, eliminate distractions. Seriously. Put your phone in another room, use website blockers, tell your family you need dedicated study time. Your environment plays a massive role.

Fourth, don't aim for perfection right away. Start small. Maybe it's just 30 minutes of focused study a day. Then gradually increase it. It's about building the habit, not burning out.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're going to have off days. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You got this!

t3_sunwbq,"[Need Advice] 23 years old, been in a really dark place, now trying to win over myself and be a better person","Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like ""I didn't have much more to say"" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.

**Two minors issues**

* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).
* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  
 

**My two biggest issues**

* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking ""ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?"" and the thought really really scares me.  
 
* **Dating** \--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think ""Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?"" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  
 

**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**","I took a quick read through and let me just plop down some advice from my almost 30’s self. 

The desire to change and make adjustments never goes away no matter how much you change. If you’re dissatisfied now that means you need to take whatever small things you can start TODAY and go from there. It takes such a long time to make active changes in your life no matter how small or low you aim you need to start today. In my experience nothing has ever been a quantum leap but rather constant tiny changes in my “right now” decision making.","May I ask what is the rush to date?

Your a VERY young guy with a LOT of growth left to do. If you are not truly satisfied with all aspects of ur life then give dating a miss for the time being and focus competent on YOU. 
There’s a lot more I would like to say but I advise you take a day off and binge watch these 2 you tubers:

“Hamza” and “first man”

These 2 will rework your mindset and set you on a good path for self improvement

Good luck G and see you on the other side","Hey there! First off, kudos for reaching out and being open about what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Let's break this down a bit.

For your body image and gym routine, it's great that you're already making strides. The key to maintaining it is to find a routine that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing long-term. Maybe mix it up with activities you like, whether it's a sport, hiking, or even dancing. Consistency is more sustainable when it's fun.

Cutting down on alcohol is a solid move, especially since you've noticed it affects your decisions. Try setting clear boundaries for yourself, like limiting drinks to certain occasions or opting for non-alcoholic alternatives when socializing. It’s all about finding a balance that works for you.

Regarding NoFap, remember that it's okay to take small steps. Instead of thinking about never doing it again, focus on reducing the frequency gradually. Celebrate small victories, like going a few days without it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. It's a journey, not a sprint.

As for dating, it's perfectly okay to take a break and focus on yourself, especially with all the changes coming up. Building a strong relationship with yourself can make future relationships more fulfilling. If you're worried about loneliness, try deepening connections with friends or exploring new hobbies that bring you joy and community.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right path by identifying what you want to change. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!","Thanks for sharing your story - it takes courage to open up about these challenges. Let me address your main concerns:

For the porn/masturbation issue, rather than thinking of it as a permanent life change that you have to commit to forever (which can feel overwhelming), try taking it one day at a time. Each day is a fresh start. When urges come up, have a plan ready - go for a walk, do some pushups, call a friend, or work on a hobby. The key is replacing the habit with healthier coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety.

Regarding dating, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. There's nothing wrong with taking a few months to focus on personal growth, especially given your upcoming moves. Use this time to build habits that make you feel good about yourself - the gym routine you've started is perfect. When you do date again, try to approach it with less emphasis on impressing others and more on genuine connection.

For maintaining habits long-term (like the gym), the key is starting small and being consistent rather than perfect. Instead of working out daily, maybe commit to 3 times a week so it's more sustainable when school starts. Same goes for alcohol - rather than trying to quit completely, set clear boundaries like ""only on weekends"" or ""max 2 drinks.""

Remember that building discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about making small, consistent improvements and getting back on track when you slip up. Focus on one change at a time rather than trying to transform everything at once. You've already taken positive steps by going to the gym and reducing drinking - that shows you're capable of making meaningful changes.","It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles and vulnerabilities with others, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of emotional, physical, and habitual challenges, but the fact that you're acknowledging them and seeking help is a huge step forward.

One thing that stood out to me was your tendency to self-sabotage or fall back into old habits when things get tough. This is really common, especially when it comes to things like exercise, drinking, or porn use. One strategy that might help is to focus on building self-compassion and understanding why you're turning to these coping mechanisms in the first place. Instead of beating yourself up over setbacks, try to approach them with kindness and curiosity. Ask yourself what triggered the behavior, and what you can do differently next time.

Regarding your concerns about dating and relationships, it might be helpful to take a step back and focus on building a stronger sense of self before diving into new relationships. This doesn't mean you have to give up on love or connection entirely, but rather that you prioritize getting to know yourself, your values, and what you want out of life. This can help you develop a sense of stability and confidence that will serve you well in any future relationships.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the NoFap journey. It's tough, and it's okay to slip up sometimes. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to quit cold turkey forever, try focusing on progress, not perfection. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be afraid to seek out support or resources when you need them.

Remember, personal growth is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own needs and well-being above all else. You got this, and you're not alone.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now, but it's awesome that you're actively trying to improve things. It takes courage to face these issues head-on.

Regarding the gym, instead of aiming for perfection right away, maybe focus on consistency. Even if it's just 2-3 times a week when school gets busy, that's way better than stopping completely. Think maintenance, not just transformation. Find something you enjoy doing at the gym too, that'll make it easier to stick with.

Cutting back on alcohol is a great goal. Maybe try finding some non-alcoholic drinks you enjoy so you have options when you're in social situations. It's okay to take it slow and celebrate small wins.

The porn/masturbation issue is tough, and it's super common. Don't beat yourself up about relapsing. Five days is a good start! Instead of thinking ""never again,"" maybe focus on smaller, achievable goals, like ""I'll go one day without it."" Find other things to do when you feel the urge – go for a walk, read a book, call a friend. The fear of a ""life-changing decision"" is real, so break it down into smaller, manageable steps. There are some great resources in the r/NoFap community too.

As for dating, it's totally valid to feel exhausted by it. Maybe take a break and focus on building your own stability and happiness. You don't *need* a relationship to be happy. Use this time to explore your hobbies, connect with your friends, and just enjoy being you. When you feel more grounded, you can revisit dating if you want. It's okay to prioritize yourself right now, especially with the upcoming moves. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find ""the one,"" and that can make dating feel like a chore.

Just remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs. Be kind to yourself, celebrate your wins, and learn from your setbacks. You've got this!

t3_ukmkx4,[NEED ADVICE] How do I stop procrastinating/distracting myself and get out of this loop of doing nothing?,"So basically I love learning I love books,drawing,science and music and I make ALOT of list of thing for these subjects the thing is I never get to do 1 in any of the list thing cause I wake up get on my phone watch youtube tell myself ill do it after finish watching youtube instead of reading I jerk off feel bad cause I got distracted and jerked off go on youtube and then the same shit happens for weeks I feel like a loser just writing this honestly","dawg hear me out. i’m in the same loop. and the worse is being aware it’s happening. there’s many factors that make u go back into bad habits, but the main one is thought patterns. for me there’s some triggers that aren’t even subconscious that make me become a piece of shit for the day and it’s letting my mind wander. 
when i give myself time to think about things and create distance between the things i have to do in order to reduce the anxiety of actually doing it, i just disassociate and end up wasting my time so bottom line.
materialize the things u like to do and would like to be doing. write em on a piece of paper. everything u can think of. then choose the easiest one or the one u think it’s the most enjoyable.
then the next day choose a small fraction of your day ONLY FOR THAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITY. and when the time comes be completely focused on it for the whole period of time u have established ( don’t be delusional and aim too high, remember ur still a piece of shit for now) and do the same thing for a couple of days. then u can do 2 things to further continues this beneficial loop. increase the time which u spend doing that activity or implement another one( try not to blend them, make ‘em different things). 
and another thing. morning routines bro. i noticed on myself that the way i start the day heavily impacts on how i go about my day. if i go to sleep too late and wake up feeling like shit i don’t feel like doing anything productive the whole day, so go to sleep early wake up at a good time and have 3-4 things u could do consistently every morning to establish a routine. it’s gonna make u feel at least a little rewarded even if u go on and do nothing the rest of the day. if u have trouble with sleeping i can give u some tips just tag me","well besides what the dude below said here’s my recommendations:
1- don’t eat a big meal before bed. it’s gonna make u regret being born at 3AM while u stare at the ceiling unable to sleep. if possible eat ur last meal 2 half hours before bed. 
2-completely dark out ur room. it might seem stupid but our eyes can see small lights even with our eyes shut so try to turn off all lights u have in ur room
3- i recommend if possible setting ur waking time somewhere at the rise of the sun and whenever u can going outside and doing a 10 min walk. our cells have biological clocks that activate when we see blueish-yellowish lights. it happens more at sunrise than dawn. and if u implement some exercise in the morning after ur walk it’s even better. 
4- plan your sleep in 90 min sleeping blocks. what i mean is whenever u want to go to wake up, go back in 90 min time blocks and find what’s the best time u should go to sleep. bc our bodies go through a hour and a half sleep cycles and if u wake in between one you’ll feel tired but if u have up at the end or beginning of a cycle you’ll feel more alert and refreshed. 
5–and lastly avoid using ur phone before bed. i struggle with this one cuz i’m too addicted lmao but it’s necessary. try to make your last hour or 30 min before bed a relaxing time. write a bit, read, listen to relaxing music, etc. 
also some researchers say warm showers before bed may help u fall asleep faster. 
if ur able to all of these over time it will help you have a better sleeping schedule. but start first with undoing the bad things u do and then try to implement the good things ( be on ur phone , eating)
it’s a tedious process but if u commit to it u can fix ur sleep.","Hey there! It sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's tough to break, but the good news is that you can definitely turn things around with some small changes. First, try setting a specific time limit for your YouTube sessions, like 15-20 minutes, and use an app or timer to help you stick to it. Once the time's up, switch to one of the activities you love, even if it's just for 10 minutes. This way, you're gradually building the habit of transitioning from distractions to productive activities. Also, consider starting your day with a quick win—something small and easy from your list that you can accomplish right away. This can give you a sense of achievement and momentum to tackle more. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've got this!","Hey there - breaking out of a procrastination loop is tough, but totally doable. The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum from there. Instead of making lists of everything you want to learn, pick ONE tiny thing to focus on first.

For example, if you want to read more, commit to reading just one page before touching your phone in the morning. That's it. One page. Make it so easy you can't say no. Put your phone in another room while you do it.

For the phone/YouTube habit, try installing a website blocker and setting specific times when you can watch videos. Cold turkey is rough - scheduling dedicated ""YouTube time"" makes it more manageable. You could do 25 minutes of focused activity (reading, drawing, whatever you picked), then allow yourself 5 minutes of videos as a reward.

The urges and distractions will still come up, but instead of beating yourself up, just notice them and gently redirect back to your chosen activity. Every time you do this, you're building that discipline muscle.

Remember that change happens gradually. Focus on consistency over intensity. If you stick to even 5-10 minutes of deliberate practice each day, you'll be amazed at how things shift over a few weeks. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the pattern - now it's just about taking small actions to change it.","It sounds like you're really struggling with getting started on the things that genuinely interest you, and instead, you're getting caught up in a cycle of distraction. One thing that might help is to set a specific, achievable goal for yourself each day - not a list of 10 things, but just one thing you want to accomplish, like ""today I will read for 30 minutes"" or ""today I will practice drawing for 20 minutes"". Make it super concrete and manageable. Then, try to eliminate the distractions before they even become an issue. For example, you could delete YouTube from your phone or use a website blocker to limit your access to it during certain hours of the day. It might also be helpful to create a morning routine that gets you started on a positive note, like making a cup of coffee and reading for 10 minutes before even checking your phone. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to be perfect - so don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Just acknowledge it and try to do better the next day. You've got a lot of interesting hobbies and passions, and it's worth finding ways to make time for them.","Hey, it sounds like you're stuck in a tough cycle, but the fact that you're aware of it and want to change is a huge first step. It's super common to get caught in those loops.

One thing that might help is to make the things you *want* to do easier to access than the distractions. So, instead of waking up and immediately grabbing your phone, try putting it across the room or even in another room overnight. Maybe put a book you're excited about right next to your bed. Small changes to your environment can make a big difference.

Also, don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick *one* thing from your list that you're genuinely excited about and commit to just 5-10 minutes on it. Seriously, that's it. The goal isn't to accomplish a ton, it's to break the cycle and build momentum. Once you've done that for a few days, you can slowly increase the time.

Regarding the other thing, don't beat yourself up too much. It happens. Just acknowledge it, and try to redirect your energy back to something positive. Maybe even use it as a trigger: ""Okay, I just did that, now I'm going to read for 10 minutes.""

You've got this. It's about small, consistent steps, not giant leaps. Good luck!

t3_qxe97z,[Need Advice] how can I get things done after waking up late,"Title, I woke up later the past few days and i feel so out of it, like I can’t do anything really. 


What should I do to offset this so I have more motivation when waking up late. 


I need to fix the sleep as well.","What I find helpful when waking up late, is to try to follow my usual routine, even if it means I'm a couple of hours behind.  In doing this, I start to build up momentum, and eventually get back into my normal tempo.  If I don't follow my normal routine, I find that it can derail my whole day.","100% agree, time spent beating yourself up from waking up late won’t help! You probably needed the sleep so give yourself some slack. 

But at the same time take some baby steps towards getting things done. No motivation to make your whole bed? Just shift your pillow to the right position. No motivation to get any study done? Maybe just opening and reading 2 lines today is enough. Then add a little more as the days go by. 

Motivation comes from action rather than inspiration :)","Waking up late can definitely throw off your day, but there are a few things you can try to get back on track. First, don't beat yourself up about waking up late; it happens to everyone. Start by setting a small, achievable goal for the day to give yourself a sense of accomplishment. This could be something as simple as making your bed or doing a quick 5-minute stretch. 

To help with motivation, try to establish a morning routine that you enjoy and look forward to, even if you wake up later than planned. This could include a favorite breakfast, a short walk, or listening to music you love. 

As for fixing your sleep schedule, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed, and create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. 

Remember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself and keep experimenting with what works best for you. You've got this!","Hey there - I totally get the late wake-up struggle. The key is to not write off the whole day just because you woke up later than planned. Instead of letting a late start derail you, try this: As soon as you wake up (regardless of time), do one small productive thing right away. Make your bed, drink a glass of water, or do 5 minutes of stretching. This helps shake off that groggy feeling and builds momentum.

For fixing your sleep schedule, work backwards from when you need to wake up and set a firm bedtime. The trick is to keep this same sleep/wake schedule even on weekends. Your body will adjust within a few days if you're consistent.

Some practical tips that help: Put your phone across the room so you have to get up to turn off the alarm. Open your curtains right when you wake up - natural light helps reset your body clock. And try to get some movement in within the first hour of waking, even if it's just a short walk.

Remember - productivity isn't about perfect mornings, it's about making the most of whatever time you have. Start small, be consistent, and you'll get back on track.","Waking up late can definitely throw off your whole day. First, let's tackle the sleep issue - try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, to get your body into a routine. It might also help to establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine, like reading or meditation, to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. As for motivation when waking up late, try breaking down your day into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by everything you need to do, focus on one thing you can accomplish right away, like making your bed or getting some fresh air. Sometimes, getting that first small win can give you the momentum you need to tackle more. Additionally, consider setting a ""stop doing"" list - identify things that are not essential, like scrolling through your phone, and cut them out for a bit to free up time and mental energy for more important tasks. Remember, it's all about making progress, not perfection, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything done right away.","Hey, I get that feeling. When you wake up late, it's easy to feel like the whole day is shot. Here's what I'd suggest:

First, don't try to cram everything you missed into the rest of the day. That's a recipe for burnout. Instead, pick *one* important task and focus on getting that done. Even a small win can shift your mindset.

Second, address the sleep issue directly. Start tonight. Set a bedtime alarm (seriously, an alarm to *go* to bed) and stick to it, even if you're not tired. Dim the lights an hour before, and avoid screens. Consistency is key here.

Third, when you wake up late, resist the urge to just ""go with it."" Immediately do something that wakes you up and gets you moving. A quick shower, some jumping jacks, or even just splashing cold water on your face can help snap you out of that sluggish feeling.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Everyone has off days. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just focus on getting back on track tomorrow. You got this!

t3_ukfyy0,"[NEED ADVICE] I love my job, and I am really good at what I do, but I might lose it.","Lately my mind and mental state are affecting my work, I keep on procrascinating, and very overwhelmed by the tasks I need to do at work.
In my mind, I know how to do them, and they all are tasks that I'm capable of doing. But somehow I'm afraid of it.
Turning on the pc feels very daunting, I want to run away from it. I feel like lately I've been only barely doing my tasks, the results are sloppy, and my colleagues notice it, it makes me feel very insecure, I don't want to reply any of the messages and emails from my colleagues, or do any tasks that I need to do.

I do want to keep my job, and clean all the mess, then one day feel good about my job again, but now I feel like I'm in a big hole, it feels so hard to climb out.

I know I need to keep on working so that I can feel better and better, then have a good monentum going.

But I don't know how.
I'm now working from home, which I never did before, maybe that's one of the reasons, but I don't know.

Edit: Update 5.8

Thanks all for the amazing advices!! Thanks to you I'm glad to not feel alone in this, and hearing experiences of others, seeing you guys already triumphed over similar situation, definitely cheered me up and gave me a glimpse of hope.
I haven't replied your comments much today, that's because I've powered through and had a very productive Sunday! (but I've read them all). 

Now I've already tackled one big task, and also made a check list of all the things I will do tomorrow at work, complete with the timing of each thing. And now I'm off to bed, setting a reasonable waking up time, at 9:00. Wish me luck!

Thanks a lot guys, truly.","You only have to please one person at work.
Your boss.
Ask your boss for a private moment and tell him what you are dealing with. Then do whatever they recommend. Ignore all other advice. If your boss is happy you are doing a great job.","Talk to your superiors/manager/HR. Inform them you're having a difficult time, and explain how you think your performance is being impacted by your state-of-mind. If you have any diagnosis (depression, anxiety) provide that information to HR. 

If you have depressive symptoms, but not necessarily MDD. This is even more of a reason to communicate your lapse in performance. 
People eat up humility, and admittance of mistakes (even if there was no mistake). 

If you're working in a position that can get work done in the off hours. Do it. If you like the job, and want to alleviate workload stress. Sometimes you're going to need to put in extra hours. 

An important aspect to be successful in a work from home position. Is extreme self discipline and a maturity to be responsible about your time.","Hey, it sounds like you're already making some great progress by tackling a big task and planning your day. Working from home can definitely be a big adjustment, so you're not alone in feeling this way. One thing that might help is creating a dedicated workspace if you haven't already. It can make a big difference in separating work from home life. Also, try setting small, achievable goals for each work session. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and give you a sense of accomplishment as you check things off your list. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and step away when you need to recharge. You've got this, and it's awesome to see you taking steps to regain control. Good luck!","It's great that you've already taken the first steps by recognizing the issue and wanting to turn things around. Working from home is definitely a different beast that requires adjusting your approach.

Here's what's worked for me when dealing with similar WFH struggles:

Start small - pick ONE task first thing in the morning. Not the biggest or scariest one, just something manageable. Complete it before checking emails or messages. This builds momentum for the day.

Set up a proper workspace if you haven't already. Having a dedicated spot just for work helps your brain switch into ""work mode"" versus being in relaxation spaces.

Use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Don't worry about perfect productivity. Even if you only get 15 good minutes out of each session, that's progress.

For the backlog of messages and tasks - tackle them in scheduled blocks. Set aside specific times (like 10-11am for emails) rather than letting them loom over you all day.

The fact that you know you're capable of doing these tasks is huge. Your skills haven't disappeared - you're just adjusting to a new work environment. Take it one task at a time, celebrate small wins, and rebuild that momentum gradually.

Your Sunday productivity and making that checklist are awesome first steps. Keep that energy going, but remember it's a marathon, not a sprint. You've got this!","It's great to see that you've had a productive Sunday and are taking steps towards getting back on track. Creating a checklist with timings is a fantastic idea, as it can help break down overwhelming tasks into manageable chunks. Since you're working from home for the first time, it might be helpful to establish a dedicated workspace and routine to separate work from personal life. Try to maintain a consistent schedule, including regular working hours and breaks, to build momentum and avoid procrastination. Remember that small wins can add up, so focus on making progress one task at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks - instead, learn from them and adjust your approach as needed. You've already shown that you're capable of tackling challenging tasks, so keep building on that momentum and celebrate your successes along the way. Good luck with your goals, and I hope you continue to make progress and find joy in your job again.","Hey, I've been there, and it sucks. It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue, especially with the shift to working from home. It's great that you recognize the problem and want to fix it!

First, HUGE congrats on the productive Sunday and making that checklist! That's a massive step in the right direction. Seriously, celebrate that win.

Now, for keeping the momentum going:

*   **Break it down even further:** That checklist is awesome, but if tasks still feel overwhelming, break them into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps. Instead of ""Write report,"" try ""Open report document"" or ""Write the title of the report."" Seriously. The goal is to make the initial action so easy you can't say no. Once you've started, it's much easier to keep going.
*   **Timeboxing is your friend:** You've already started with the timing on your checklist, which is great. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break). Knowing you only have to focus for 25 minutes can make a huge difference. During your breaks, *actually* step away from the computer.
*   **Tackle the avoidance:** You mentioned not wanting to reply to emails. Pick *one* email you've been avoiding and just reply to it. Even a short ""Got it, will get back to you soon"" is better than nothing. Get that small win under your belt.
*   **Environment matters:** Since you're working from home, try to create a dedicated workspace. Even if it's just a corner of a room, make it a place that's specifically for work. This can help mentally separate work from relaxation.
*   **Be kind to yourself:** You're not going to be perfect every day. There will be setbacks. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track.

You've already proven you can do this by having a productive Sunday. Just keep taking small steps, and you'll climb out of that hole. Good luck! You got this!

t3_qxpo5q,[Need Advice] Waking Up Late Is Ruining My Life.,"I am a student who is preparing for competitive exams. I make a routine and there is a duration for everything that a will study on a day. 
I have a big alarm clock that makes super loud noise. I installed an alarm app (alarmy) that cannot be snoozed or turned off unless I complete some math tests on the app. I tie my phone to my wrist because the vibration from alarm can wake me up. My sleep time is adequate. Yet, I fail everyday. 
The clcok? I just pushed the alarm button to ""off"".
The alarm app? Since it cannot be turned off, I switch off or even pull battery from my phone. I go back to sleep. 
Here is something more infuriating. My brother leaves home early in the morning and I leave my bed to go and lock the door after he leaves. Yet, I instead of washing my face with water, I go back to my bed and go back to sleep. The desire to sleep at that moment is so strong that no logic works in my mind. 
When I had job, I used to wake up on my own and even didn't need any alarm. The face of my ex-boss and fear of losing job made me wake up automatically. 
Now there is no fear in me when I wake up and then I go back to sleep. What an asshole I am. 
At this moment, I don't have a job but to get a job i need to ace in the competitive exams. So, I am studying hard all day but almost everyday I fail to complete my expected amount of study because I lose 3 to 4 hours in late rising in morning. Not to mention, when I wake up late and start to study late on my routine, I feel so angry. I hate myself on that moment and promise myself that it won't happen next day but unfortunately this has been going on for a long time. The desire to sleep more ruins my entire day. 
Please someone help me with suggestions. How can I stop myself from falling back to sleep? 
PS: My sleep is healthy and adequate. I just skip stufy and sleep.","The idea of forcing yourself to ""just get up"" is ignoring the real possibility of a biological issue. 

If it's consistently difficult to wake up, then it may be more than laziness, and there could be a lot that's keeping you from getting good sleep. 

There is a ton you can do to improve sleep, but rather than listen to random people on reddit, you should check out [this podcast](https://youtu.be/nm1TxQj9IsQ). This guy is a real scientist and one of the best channels for anyone in this sub.

Also, if you're not familiar with Biohacking, it's a whole can of worms, but [here is a bio hackers guide to sleep](https://shop.biohackercenter.com/products/biohackers-handbook-sleep-e-book) (free e-book)

I've done as much of this as possible, and now I wake up before 7AM every day with no alarm. 

Make sure you get a blood test to ensure you dont have nutrient deficiencies, and focus on eating healthy overall. But after that, the biggest things that helped me were;

1. Going to bed at the *same time* consistently, even on weekends. Along with allowing at least 8-9 hours before I have to be up.

2. Light therapy. I got a smart light that dims and shifts to a warmer color at night, and very slowly comes back on when it's time to wake up, as well as avoiding screens right before bed.

3. Sleeping in complete darkness, and a slightly cooler temperature.

4. Exercise during the day! 

5. Don't eat within a few hours before bed.

6. Getting a decent bed and pillow that work for my body type.

Everyone is different, so put in the time to experiment and see what right for you. Either way, sleep is one of the most important things for overall health and especially cognition! So don't take it lightly.","I agree. When I worked night shifts in a bar during last years of my university time, I couldn't stick to my 9 to 7 pm study times anymore and instead started studying at 11 am or later until 8 or 10 pm.","Hey there! It sounds like you're really committed to making a change, which is a great first step. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Create a Morning Ritual**: Since you used to wake up for your job, try to recreate that sense of urgency. Set a small task that you have to do immediately after waking up, like making your bed or doing a quick stretch. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to start the day.

2. **Accountability Partner**: Find a friend or family member who can check in with you in the morning. Sometimes knowing someone else is counting on you can be a powerful motivator.

3. **Gradual Change**: If waking up early is too big of a leap, try adjusting your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day. This can make the transition smoother and less daunting.

4. **Reward System**: Give yourself a small reward for waking up on time. It could be something simple like enjoying a favorite breakfast or a few minutes of a hobby you love.

5. **Reflect on Your Why**: Remind yourself why these exams are important to you. Visualize the benefits of passing them and how it will impact your future. This can help reignite that internal motivation.

Remember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!","It sounds like you've tried the technical solutions (alarms, apps, etc.) but the core issue is that sleepy-you is really good at sabotaging awake-you's plans. This is super common - your brain is excellent at finding loopholes when it wants more sleep!

Since external motivation (like your old job) worked well before, let's create some immediate consequences for your morning routine. Here are a few approaches that have worked for others:

Get an accountability partner. Tell your brother before he leaves that you'll send him a photo of yourself at your study desk by X time. If you don't, you owe him money or have to do his chores. Make the stakes real but reasonable.

Put your alarm clock/phone across the room by your study materials. When you get up to turn it off, immediately sit at your desk and start your first task. Don't give yourself time to debate or rationalize - make it one fluid motion from alarm to studying.

Create a ""morning score"" system. Give yourself points for getting up on time and starting study by your target time. Lose points for oversleeping. Set weekly goals and reward yourself when you hit them (maybe with something you really want).

The key is breaking that moment where you decide to go back to bed. Once you're vertical and moving, stay that way. Splash cold water on your face, drink some water, do a few jumping jacks - whatever it takes to get past those crucial first few minutes when your sleepy brain is trying to talk you into ""just 5 more minutes.""

Remember: You don't have to feel motivated or energetic. You just have to not get back in bed. Start there, and build on small wins.","It sounds like you've tried some creative methods to wake yourself up, but you're still struggling to stick to your routine. One thing that might be worth exploring is identifying the underlying reasons why you're having such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. You mentioned that when you had a job, the fear of losing it was a strong motivator for you to wake up on time. Now that you don't have that external pressure, you might need to find an internal motivation to replace it.

Since you're studying for competitive exams, you could try to remind yourself why waking up early is important for your goals. Write down your reasons for wanting to ace these exams and post them somewhere visible, like on your bedroom wall or fridge. This might help you connect with your motivations and give you a sense of purpose when your alarm goes off.

In terms of practical strategies, you could try making a plan for the first 10-15 minutes after you wake up that doesn't involve going back to bed. For example, you could make yourself a cup of coffee or tea, do some light stretching, or simply sit outside for a few minutes to get some fresh air. Having a small goal to achieve right away might help you build momentum and make it easier to stick to your routine.

It's also worth considering the environment you're waking up in. You mentioned that you leave your bed to lock the door after your brother leaves, but then you go back to bed. Could you try making your bedroom a space that's less conducive to sleeping? For example, you could open your curtains to let in natural light, or move your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's clear that you're frustrated with your current situation, but beating yourself up over it isn't going to help. Instead, try to focus on making small improvements each day and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they might seem. Good luck!","Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've got the motivation to study, but your brain is playing tricks on you in the morning. It's super frustrating when you know what you *should* be doing, but you just can't seem to make it happen.

It seems like you're relying heavily on external motivators (alarms, etc.), but those are easy to defeat when you're half-asleep. Maybe try shifting your focus to internal motivation. You mentioned the fear of your ex-boss got you up. Can you tap into that feeling of responsibility or consequence, but apply it to your studies? Think about *why* you want to ace these exams. Visualize the positive outcome – the job, the financial security, the feeling of accomplishment. Really connect with that feeling before you go to bed.

Also, instead of just trying to brute force yourself awake, try making the morning more appealing. What if you prepped a really delicious breakfast the night before? Or had a favorite podcast or audiobook ready to go? Something you actually *look forward* to.

Another thing: maybe your study schedule is too rigid. If you're constantly failing to meet your goals, it can be demoralizing. Could you make it a little more flexible, so a late start doesn't completely derail your day? Even just shifting things around so the most important tasks are first thing might help.

Finally, don't beat yourself up so much. Everyone slips up. The important thing is to learn from it and keep trying. Maybe keep a journal and track what works and what doesn't. You've got this!

t3_y2ypna,[Need Advice] Feeling Unimportant on my Birthday,"It’s my birthday and I feel awful. All my family and loved ones are too far away to celebrate and most people on earth don’t even realize it. Even the social media I haven’t used in forever people aren’t wishing me happy birthday so it feels even more lonely. Sure I have family and maybe the day has begun so I just don’t feel amazing and might be overreacting but I want to because I feel like I deserve/entitled to some time where I can be seen as important without having to want to feel memorable if that makes sense.

Malabo I’m getting older meaning my dreams that I’m waiting on opportunity to succeed in are not happening and I’m angry that I’ve not been blessed with the discipline or talent to make these a reality!","HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Another summer with you baby, treat yourself a cake, call your fam and watch a good movie at the cinema or go to a theater watch a funny play. Take care 🎉",Yoooooo it's my shitty birthday today too!! Happy shittty birthday fellow shitty birthday buddy. We have no choice but to hang in there,"Hey there! First off, happy birthday! 🎉 It’s totally okay to want to feel special on your day. Birthdays can be tough when you’re not surrounded by loved ones, but it’s a great opportunity to focus on yourself and what you want to achieve. 

For the dreams you’re chasing, remember that discipline is like a muscle—it gets stronger the more you use it. Start small by setting daily or weekly goals that align with your bigger dreams. Celebrate the small wins, and over time, you’ll build the momentum you need. 

Also, consider reaching out to friends or family for a quick chat or video call. Sometimes a little connection can make a big difference. And if you’re feeling up to it, maybe treat yourself to something you enjoy today. You deserve it! Keep pushing forward, and remember, it’s never too late to work towards your dreams.","Happy birthday! The feeling of being ""unseen"" on your special day is tough, especially when loved ones are far away. But let's shift perspective a bit - birthdays can be perfect moments for reflection and self-celebration.

Instead of waiting for opportunities or external validation, why not use this birthday as a launching point to create your own path? Dreams don't have expiration dates, and discipline isn't something you're ""blessed"" with - it's a skill you build, day by day.

Here's what you can do right now: Pick one dream and break it down into small, manageable steps. Start with something you can do today, even if it's just 15 minutes of focused work. Tomorrow, do it again. That's how discipline grows.

Consider treating yourself today - do something meaningful for yourself. Maybe start a project you've been putting off, take yourself out, or begin planning concrete steps toward one of your goals. You don't need others to make your birthday special or meaningful.

Remember: Your worth isn't measured by birthday wishes or social media recognition. It's measured by the actions you take and the person you're becoming. Start today - your next birthday can look completely different if you choose to make it so.","Hey, happy birthday! It's totally understandable to feel down on your special day, especially when it feels like no one's acknowledging it. First, let's tackle the feeling of being unimportant - just because others aren't recognizing your birthday doesn't mean you're not worthy of celebration. You are important, and your life matters, regardless of whether others are aware of your birthday or not. Instead of waiting for external validation, why not take some time to do something that makes you feel special and loved? It could be as simple as cooking your favorite meal, watching a movie you've been meaning to see, or taking a relaxing bath. 

As for feeling like you're not making progress on your dreams, it's great that you're acknowledging the role of discipline in achieving your goals. Rather than beating yourself up over not having the discipline or talent yet, try breaking down your long-term goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Focus on building one habit at a time, and celebrate your small wins along the way. Remember, discipline is like a muscle that can be developed over time with consistent practice. You might not see immediate results, but with persistence and patience, you can make progress towards your dreams. Don't give up on yourself - you've got this, and you deserve to feel proud of the person you're becoming.","Hey, happy birthday! It totally sucks to feel overlooked on your birthday, especially when you're far from loved ones. It's understandable to want to feel special and seen.

Instead of waiting for others to make you feel important, maybe you could take the reins and create your own celebration? Even something small, like treating yourself to your favorite meal, watching a movie you love, or doing a hobby you enjoy. Think of it as a day dedicated to celebrating *you* and all you've accomplished.

Regarding your dreams and feeling like you lack discipline, that's a really common feeling. Discipline isn't something you're just ""blessed"" with; it's a skill you build. Start small. Pick *one* tiny step you can take towards one of your dreams today. Maybe it's spending 15 minutes practicing a skill, researching a topic, or outlining a project. The key is consistency. Small, consistent actions build momentum and eventually, discipline. Don't beat yourself up for past inaction; focus on what you can do *right now*. You got this!

t3_x4nm48,[Need Advice] Do not have any energy left after I go to the Gym in the morning.,"So I have been going to the Gym (for a month now so Yay for me I guess). I go in the morning at 6:30 AM (Have no problem waking up at 5/5:30 AM without Alarm) and by the time I come back(between 7:30 - 8:00), I am just tired af. On the days I have college in the mornings (9 AM) I have to literally force myself and on the days I have holiday (today for eg) I just do not take a bath til 9:30 or start my studies by 11:00 AM. i am just that inefficient. I particularly do not enjoy going to the gym either, it's just something I have to do and I am too tired in the evening to even enter the Gym so evening's not an option. 

What to do in a situation like this?","I had issues with fatigue and found out it was electrolyte issues. I had to literally Injest salt pills or some sort of powder. Something to try!

Also, see if you have adhd. It’s possible you have a stimulant/dopamine reward issue.","An iron deficiency can also cause fatigue. Might be worth asking your GP and maybe getting a blood test? 

What is it that you dislike about the gym and what is it that you want to achieve by going? I hate lifting heavy things and I often don’t like going to the gym, but my goal is actually to be fit enough to not feel winded going up stairs and become more flexible. So now I do yoga and dance with apple fitness at home and I find it a lot easier to do in the evening since I don’t need to go anywhere and I find the dancing really fun","Hey, first off, congrats on sticking with the gym for a month! That's a solid start. It sounds like your morning routine is pretty intense, and it's understandable to feel drained afterward. Here are a few things you might try:

1. **Nutrition and Hydration**: Make sure you're fueling your body properly before and after your workout. A light snack before the gym and a good breakfast afterward can make a big difference in your energy levels. Also, stay hydrated!

2. **Sleep Quality**: Since you wake up early, ensure you're getting enough quality sleep. Maybe try going to bed a bit earlier if possible.

3. **Workout Intensity**: Consider adjusting the intensity of your workouts. If you're pushing too hard, it might be worth scaling back a bit until your body gets more accustomed to the routine.

4. **Active Recovery**: On days when you feel particularly tired, try incorporating some light stretching or yoga instead of a full workout. It can help with recovery and might leave you feeling more energized.

5. **Routine Adjustment**: If the gym isn't something you enjoy, maybe explore other forms of exercise that you might find more engaging. Sometimes a change in activity can make a big difference in motivation and energy.

Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you. Keep experimenting and adjusting until you find a routine that leaves you feeling more energized throughout the day. Good luck!","First off, congrats on sticking with the gym for a month - that's a solid achievement! The post-workout fatigue you're experiencing is totally normal, especially when you're new to morning workouts. Here are a few tweaks that could help:

Make sure you're getting enough quality sleep by going to bed early enough to support your 5:30 wake-up. Even if you can wake up naturally, your body needs consistent, adequate rest to recover from workouts.

Your post-workout nutrition and hydration are crucial. Try having a small pre-workout snack (like a banana) and drinking water before the gym. After working out, eat a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs within 30 minutes - this helps with energy levels and recovery.

Consider adjusting your workout intensity. You might be going too hard too soon. Start with moderate intensity and gradually increase it as your body adapts. This doesn't mean taking it easy - just being strategic about building up your stamina.

For the immediate post-gym sluggishness, try taking a cold shower right after. It's uncomfortable but really helps with alertness. Also, get into a routine of changing into fresh clothes and starting your day immediately after your shower, rather than letting yourself lounge.

If after trying these adjustments you're still struggling, you might want to experiment with different workout times. While evenings aren't an option for you, maybe try 7:30 or 8:00 AM for a few weeks and see if that helps with your energy levels throughout the day.

Remember, it takes time for your body to adapt to a new routine. Keep at it, but be willing to make adjustments until you find what works best for you.","It sounds like you're doing great by sticking to your morning gym routine for a month now, but it's definitely taking a toll on your energy levels. One thing you might want to consider is adjusting your post-workout routine to help you recover faster. For example, you could try having a protein shake or a light meal within 30-60 minutes after your workout to help replenish your energy stores. Additionally, making sure you're getting enough sleep and establishing a consistent bedtime routine could also help improve your overall energy levels throughout the day.

It might also be helpful to reassess your expectations for what you can accomplish immediately after your workout. It's not uncommon for people to feel tired or sluggish after exercise, especially if they're just starting out. Instead of trying to dive into college work or studies right away, maybe give yourself a bit of buffer time to relax and recharge. Even just taking a 30-minute break to grab a snack, take a shower, or simply sit down and collect your thoughts could make a big difference.

Lastly, since you mentioned you don't particularly enjoy going to the gym, it might be worth exploring ways to make your workouts more enjoyable or finding alternative forms of exercise that you do like. This could help make the experience less draining and give you something to look forward to. What do you think about trying some new exercises or activities to mix things up?","Hey, congrats on sticking with the gym for a month! That's a solid start. It sounds like the morning workouts are just draining you for the rest of the day, which is counterproductive.

A few things to consider: First, are you eating enough, especially protein and carbs, before and after your workouts? Fueling your body properly can make a huge difference in your energy levels. Experiment with different pre-workout snacks (like a banana with peanut butter or a protein shake) and make sure you're having a good post-workout meal to replenish your glycogen stores.

Second, maybe you're pushing yourself too hard at the gym. It's great to be dedicated, but if you're completely wiped out afterward, you might need to scale back the intensity or duration of your workouts. Try focusing on form and controlled movements rather than just trying to lift the heaviest weight possible. You could also try shorter, more focused workouts.

Third, think about your sleep. Even though you're waking up early without an alarm, are you getting enough *quality* sleep? Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. A consistent sleep schedule can also help regulate your energy levels.

Finally, since you mentioned you don't enjoy the gym, maybe explore other forms of exercise you might find more engaging. If you dread going, it's going to be harder to maintain the habit. Finding something you actually enjoy will make it easier to stick with it and might even give you more energy! Good luck!

t3_ocxh5e,[Need Advice] How do I manage to convince myself I’ll do something tomorrow when I have a terrible track record of actually doing a task next the next day?!,"
I seem to be completely unaware of my abilities and capabilities. At times I’ll convince myself I can do anything in the world, and on other times I’ll convince myself I’m a good for nothing failure. It’s crazy how I’ll start a task and be so happy to have even started the task, I’ll be like yeah see you can start a task whenever you want. With my newfound confidence, I’ll be riding that ‘high’ and end up procrastinating and that would be the end of my task for that day. Time and time again I procrastinate and hate myself for it later, but I somehow manage to convince myself to procrastinate again! It’s crazy! How do I break this loop? Should I just assume that there’s no way I’ll end up doing the task later, and hence there’s no better time than now? I’ve gotten to the point of initiating the task but I struggle to keep up the momentum. I’m really tired and I think it’s high time I break out of this seemingly never ending loop. I’ll take any suggestions I can get.","Perhaps it can help by viewing your future self as an separate entity that you can help out by doing something today. Sounds like he would be very grateful if he didn't have to go through the pain of pushing through procrastination habits again.

I also like to fool myself into only asking to do a chore for a few more minutes when I want to quit, usually I stick to it a while longer","Easy. **DON'T** say you'll do it tomorrow. Get up and do it right now. Tomorrow does not exist. It's a hypothetical period of time. As soon as ""tomorrow"" comes, it's today, and no one is guaranteed a ""tomorrow"" anyway. Do it now.","Hey there! It sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's all too familiar to many of us. The key to breaking this loop is to start small and build consistency. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Clear, Achievable Goals**: Instead of telling yourself you'll do something tomorrow, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if you need to write a report, set a goal to write just one paragraph today. This makes it less daunting and easier to start.

2. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your tasks at the same time each day. This helps build a habit and reduces the mental energy needed to decide when to start.

3. **Use a Timer**: The Pomodoro Technique can be really effective. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and prevent burnout.

4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for completing even the smallest tasks. This can help reinforce positive behavior and keep you motivated.

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of the day, take a moment to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Adjust your approach as needed.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","The key is to stop relying on motivation and ""future you"" - they're both unreliable. Instead, treat task completion like brushing your teeth: you don't debate whether to do it tomorrow, you just do it now because it needs to be done.

Here's what's working against you: Every time you tell yourself ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" you're reinforcing a habit of postponement. And each time you break that promise to yourself, you're weakening your self-trust. 

Try this approach instead: When you start a task and feel that initial boost of accomplishment, immediately set a tiny next step. Not ""I'll finish this later"" but ""I'll do exactly X more minutes/pages/steps right now."" Make it small enough that it feels almost ridiculous to quit. This builds momentum through small wins rather than relying on sustained motivation.

For breaking the procrastination loop, use the 5-minute rule. When you catch yourself thinking about doing something ""later,"" either start it for just 5 minutes right now, or explicitly schedule it (with a specific time) in your calendar. No vague ""tomorrows."" This forces you to either commit or honestly acknowledge you're choosing not to do it.

Remember: Future You will have the exact same struggles as Present You. The only difference is that Future You will have less time and more stress about the delayed task. The best time to start is always now, even if it's just for 5 minutes.","It sounds like you're struggling with a classic case of the ""tomorrow syndrome"" and a dash of self-doubt. One strategy that might help is to focus on making a plan for the next 24 hours, rather than relying on motivation or willpower to carry you through. Instead of saying ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" try breaking down your task into smaller, manageable chunks, and schedule them into your calendar for the next day. Make sure these chunks are so small that you can't say no to them - like 10-15 minutes of work. This way, you're not relying on feeling motivated or confident, but rather on a clear plan of action. Additionally, try to acknowledge and accept your past procrastination patterns, rather than beating yourself up over them. It's okay to have struggled in the past, and it doesn't define your ability to succeed in the present. By focusing on small, achievable steps, you can start building momentum and developing a sense of self-trust that will help you stay on track. And yeah, assuming there's no better time than now is a great mindset to adopt - it can help you get started and make progress, even if it's just a tiny bit at a time.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That cycle of feeling motivated, then procrastinating, and then feeling bad about it is super common. It sounds like you're already aware of the problem, which is the first big step!

Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, maybe try breaking tasks down into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, if you want to write a paper, don't aim to write the whole thing. Aim to write *one sentence*. Seriously. The point is to make the initial hurdle so low that you can't possibly say no to it. Once you've done that one sentence, you might find it easier to keep going. And if you don't, that's okay too! You still accomplished something.

Also, try to identify what triggers your procrastination. Is it a certain time of day? A specific location? A particular feeling? Once you know your triggers, you can start to develop strategies to avoid them or deal with them in a healthier way. Maybe that means putting your phone in another room, working in a different location, or scheduling your most important tasks for when you're feeling most energetic.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Everyone procrastinates sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and try again tomorrow. Focus on progress, not perfection. You got this!

t3_w0lrqb,[Need Advice] Chronic Procrastination is killing me,"I’ve(F19) always been considered the smart kid in my family. My parents have pushed me to get A’s in everything until I finished high school where after two years of grade troubles they have stopped pushing for straight A’s.

I’ve always been a procrastinator as long as I can remember. I have a hard time focusing and starting a task and finishing a task. I push things off saying “I’ll do it tomorrow”. I’ve been lucky to go to a univeristy with a full-ride scholarship as I wouldn’t of been able to go without. I fucked up my first year with failing some classes and getting C’s in others.

I just finished 2 summer classes, one I got an A and the other a C+. When I told my grandma I got a C+, she became very upset and asked why. It makes sense as she helped pay for the 2 classes. I procrastinated, and she doesn’t understand why because I only had the one class at the time. (The summer classes happen 1 at a time). 

How do I fix this problem? I’ve tried a planner, it helps, but I still fall into the same trap of not doing my work. I know I can do well if I put my mind to it, but I just can’t find the motivation/energy to do it. Its fucking stressful. I’m stuck in a self-fulfilling loop of laziness and stress and I fucking hate it and myself for doing it. I know I have an opportunity that others would kill for and I’m wasting it. 

My inability to do work on time is killing me.","Understand what is happening in your body and nervous system. I recommend the YouTube channel therapyinanutshell.
      
When you procrastinate, you are loading yourself up with the stress hormone, cortisol, all the time. You're putting yourself in a constant state of fight, flight, freeze. Try to identify the source of the emotional pain that's causing you to avoid/distracting yourself. 
     
Ask yourself, when was the last time you really laughed? Cried? Danced? These activities are necessary to release emotions. Are you allowed to have emotions, or is your home so strict and perfectionists  you're only 'allowed' to have high grades?

First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—recognizing the issue is a big step. Procrastination is something many of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**: Sometimes the thought of completing a big task can be overwhelming. Try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it easier to start and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.

2. **Set Specific Goals**: Instead of telling yourself you'll study for a class, set a specific goal like ""I'll review chapters 1-3 for 30 minutes."" This gives you a clear target to aim for.

3. **Use a Timer**: The Pomodoro Technique can be really effective. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and prevent burnout.

4. **Find Your Peak Productivity Time**: Everyone has different times of the day when they're most productive. Try to schedule your most challenging tasks during these times.

5. **Accountability Partner**: Sometimes having someone to check in with can help keep you on track. This could be a friend, family member, or even a study group.

6. **Reflect on Your Motivation**: Remind yourself why you're doing this. Whether it's maintaining your scholarship or achieving personal goals, keeping your motivation in mind can help push you through tough times.

Remember, building discipline is a process, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","First off - you're not lazy. Procrastination isn't about laziness, it's about emotional regulation and habits. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you care deeply about improving.

The ""smart kid"" label can actually work against us sometimes. When things came easily before, we don't develop the skills to handle harder challenges. Now you're facing university-level work that requires different strategies.

Here's what's worked for many chronic procrastinators:

Start ridiculously small. Instead of ""I need to study for 3 hours,"" tell yourself ""I'll read one paragraph."" Often you'll continue once you've started, but if not, that's fine - you met your goal. Build trust with yourself through these tiny wins.

Use the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Don't worry about being perfect - even 10 minutes of focused work is better than nothing. There are great free apps for this.

Create a dedicated study space that's only for work. Your brain will start associating that space with productivity rather than procrastination.

Most importantly: forgive yourself when you slip up. Beating yourself up creates more stress, which leads to more procrastination. Instead, treat each day as a fresh start.

Consider talking to your university's academic support services. Many students struggle with this transition, and they have resources specifically for building better study habits.

Remember: this is a skill you're developing, not a character flaw. With consistent small steps and self-compassion, you can absolutely turn this around.","It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and it's affecting your academic performance and self-esteem. First, let's acknowledge that having a full-ride scholarship is a huge opportunity, and it's great that you're recognizing the value of it. Now, about breaking the cycle of procrastination - it might be helpful to identify the underlying reasons why you're putting things off. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to overcome it. 

You've tried using a planner, which is a great start. Another technique you could try is breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and setting specific deadlines for each one. This might help make your workload feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, you could try implementing the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.

It's also important to remember that motivation and energy aren't always going to be there, but discipline and habits can help carry you through. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try creating a routine and sticking to it, even when you don't feel like it. And hey, it's okay to not be perfect - it's better to make progress and learn from your mistakes than to let procrastination hold you back. You've already shown that you're capable of doing well when you put your mind to it, so let's build on that. What do you think is the smallest, most achievable step you could take today to start moving forward?","Hey, I get it. That procrastination loop is brutal, especially when you know you're capable of more. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which can actually make procrastination worse.

First, cut yourself some slack. You're 19, figuring things out, and a C+ isn't the end of the world. It's a signal to adjust, not a reason to beat yourself up.

Since planners haven't fully solved it, try breaking down your tasks into *tiny* steps. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of ""write essay,"" try ""open document and type my name."" Seriously. The goal is to make the initial step so easy you can't say no. Once you've started, the momentum often carries you further.

Also, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique. Work in focused 25-minute bursts with short breaks. It can help with focus and make the task seem less daunting. There are tons of free apps for this.

Finally, think about *why* you're procrastinating. Is it fear of failure? Boredom? If you can pinpoint the underlying reason, you can start to address it directly. Maybe talk to a counselor at your university; they're usually free and can offer strategies tailored to you. You've got this!

t3_v8z22p,[Need Advice] How do you stop depression from stopping you?,"Hi guys,
I’m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It’s bad because i’ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.

But I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.

For any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.

Edit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)","Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. 

One thing I will say is that it’s a journey. It’s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It’s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It’s going to happen, it’s going to be ok, and it does get better. 

For myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.","Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. 

I’m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that’s making you feel bad. But it’s a good place to start when trying to get on track. 

Protect your sleep. Do that by:

- Going to bed at the same time every night. 
- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)
- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)
- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)

Also, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you’ve lost all progress when you screw up once. 

Protecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.","Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking such proactive steps with your program and recognizing the need for change. That's a huge first step. When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. 

Start by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. 

Apps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through. 

Remember, it's okay to have off days. The important thing is to not let a slip turn into a fall. Be kind to yourself and focus on getting back on track the next day. You've got this!","First off, props for taking action by enrolling in that program and sticking with it for a month - that's already a huge win. Your 4-item daily list sounds really solid and manageable too.

For staying consistent while dealing with mental health challenges, I've found that treating slip-ups differently made a massive difference. Instead of viewing a missed day as a total reset, think of it like missing a meal - you wouldn't stop eating entirely just because you missed lunch, right? You'd just eat your next meal.

A few practical tools that might help:

The ""Streaks"" app is great for tracking daily habits and gives you a visual of your progress. Having that reminder and seeing your streak build up can be really motivating.

For accountability, check out the Discord server for this subreddit (in the sidebar). There are channels specifically for daily check-ins and support. Having people to report to daily makes a big difference.

One technique that's helped me push through tough mental health days is the ""5-minute rule"" - commit to just 5 minutes of an activity. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you start, but if not, you still succeeded by doing those 5 minutes.

Start tomorrow, but remember: progress isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that's completely normal. What matters is picking back up and continuing forward, even if it's just with those 5 minutes.","It's great that you've recognized the pattern of slipping back into depression and isolation, and you're taking proactive steps to change it. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Since you have a list of 4 things you want to do daily, try to create an environment that supports those habits. For example, lay out your workout clothes the night before, or put a reminder on your phone to meditate at the same time every day. 

It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have off days. Instead of beating yourself up over slipping up, try to learn from it and get back on track as soon as possible. You might find it helpful to track your progress in a journal or use an app like Habitica or HabitBull to monitor your habits and stay accountable.

Additionally, having a support system in place can make a huge difference. Since you're already in a therapy program, you might want to discuss your struggles with your therapist and see if they can offer any additional guidance or support. You could also consider joining online communities or forums for people with social anxiety disorder, where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and wanting to change, so try to focus on the small wins and celebrate your successes along the way. Good luck starting tomorrow, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support or guidance!","Hey, it's awesome you're taking such proactive steps! It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when tackling social anxiety, especially with the risk of slipping into depression.

One thing that's helped me is focusing on *progress, not perfection*. You mentioned that slipping once feels like a huge setback. Instead of viewing it that way, try to see it as a data point. If you miss a day, ask yourself *why*. Was the goal too ambitious? Were you too tired? Then adjust accordingly. Maybe break down your ""one social thing"" into even smaller, more manageable steps. Like, day 1: just walk to the store. Day 2: walk in and browse for 2 minutes. Day 3: ask an employee a question.

Also, be kind to yourself. You're dealing with a lot. Celebrate the small wins. Did you meditate for 5 minutes instead of 10? Great! You still meditated.

For accountability, have you considered finding an online support group specifically for social anxiety? Sharing your experiences and challenges with others who understand can be incredibly validating and motivating. There are also habit tracking apps like Streaks or Habitica that can gamify the process and make it more engaging.

Finally, remember that therapy is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be ups and downs. The important thing is to keep showing up for yourself. You got this!

t3_140lzrf,[Need Advice] Why is it so damn difficult to stay consistent with exercise?,"As the title states...WHY?!  The first 2 - 3 weeks I'm all-in, all gung-ho. I'm loving how I'm looking and feeling. But after a while I get burnt out and take a couple days off. Those days then become weeks and weeks and then I'm back to square one. 

I'm an early morning work out type person, I can't stand the packed & crowded gym after work and I don't have the same energy either as I do in the am. 

For those that STAY consistent,  what is your advice? 

Thank you all in advance for your time and responses.

Edit : I wasn't expecting so many replies. Thank you all for being very helpful!",Don't overdo it and when you're not feelig fully up to it accept that somethign is better than nothing. Perfect is the enemy of good.,"I started doing this with my workout clothes and my clothes for the office the night before, and then with my breakfast cooking setup (same thing every day, takes a bowl, measuring cup, spoon, skillet, cooking spray, coffee tumbler, pour over). It’s just makes the mornings so easy and automatic, helps me get out of the house earlier, no mental energy used","Hey there! Staying consistent with exercise can be tough, but you're definitely not alone in this struggle. One thing that might help is to focus on building a routine that feels sustainable rather than going all-in right from the start. Try setting smaller, more manageable goals and gradually increase the intensity or duration of your workouts. This way, you're less likely to burn out.

Also, consider mixing up your workouts to keep things interesting. If you're an early morning person, maybe try different types of exercises that you can look forward to, like a new class or a run in a different location. Lastly, remember that rest days are part of the process, not a setback. Plan them into your routine so they don't feel like you're losing momentum. Keep at it, and you'll find your groove!","This is a super common challenge - the initial motivation burst followed by burnout. The key is to shift from relying on motivation to building sustainable habits and systems.

A few things that have worked well for maintaining long-term consistency:

Start smaller than you think you need to. Instead of going all-out for 2-3 weeks, begin with a minimal routine you can definitely stick to (even 15-20 mins). You can always build up gradually.

Have a clear ""if-then"" plan for your morning workouts. The more automatic you make it, the less willpower you need. Lay out clothes the night before, keep your gym bag ready, etc. Make the path of least resistance lead to working out.

Accept that some days will feel ""meh"" and that's totally fine. You don't need to crush every workout. Simply showing up and doing something, even if it's lighter than usual, maintains the habit. Consistency > intensity.

When you feel burnout coming, scale back instead of stopping completely. Do shorter workouts or lighter days, but keep the routine. It's much easier to maintain momentum than to start over.

Track your consistency rather than just results. Use a simple habit tracker or calendar. Seeing your streak can be motivating, and it helps identify patterns in when/why you tend to fall off.

The morning workout choice is smart - fewer disruptions and excuses. Just remember that discipline isn't about being perfect, it's about getting back on track quickly when you slip. Keep at it!","I think I can offer some insight here. It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern - starting strong with motivation, but then hitting a wall and struggling to maintain consistency. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits rather than relying on motivation. Instead of trying to be ""all-in"" all the time, try to make your workouts a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. 

Also, since you mentioned you prefer early morning workouts, try to make that time as convenient and enjoyable as possible. Lay out your workout clothes the night before, prep your breakfast, and find a playlist or podcast that gets you pumped up. As for avoiding burnout, consider incorporating rest days or active recovery into your routine, like a light yoga session or a walk. This can help your body and mind recharge, making it easier to stick to your workouts in the long run. 

Lastly, try to focus on progress rather than perfection. It's okay to have off days or weeks, but don't let that derail you completely. Get back on track as soon as you can, and remind yourself why you started working out in the first place. You've already identified what works for you (early morning workouts), now it's just a matter of making it a sustainable habit.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That initial motivation is awesome, but it's a beast to maintain! Here's what's helped me stick with it long-term:

First, ditch the ""all-in"" mentality. It's a recipe for burnout. Think sustainable, not spectacular. Instead of aiming for intense workouts every day, try scaling back. Maybe 3 days a week with shorter, less intense sessions. Consistency trumps intensity, especially in the long run.

Second, build in some flexibility. Life happens. Instead of letting a missed workout derail you for weeks, have a backup plan. Maybe a quick bodyweight circuit at home if you can't make it to the gym, or even just a brisk walk. The goal is to keep the momentum going, even if it's just a little bit.

Third, find something you genuinely enjoy. If you dread your workouts, you're less likely to stick with them. Experiment with different activities until you find something that feels less like a chore and more like something you look forward to.

Finally, track your progress. Seeing how far you've come can be a huge motivator. It doesn't have to be anything fancy – just a simple log of your workouts. When you feel like giving up, look back at your progress and remind yourself of how much you've already accomplished. Good luck, you got this!

t3_plc12a,"[Need Advice] 19 year old here, feeling like I already screwed up in life","Throwaway because my friends use Reddit.

19 year old kid, turning 20 in a couple months. I guess the best thing to describe me is that I'm someone who's struggling to accept the fact that I'm not a kid anymore, and that even though I'm still very young in the grand scheme of things, I feel like I'm already set in place for one bad life.

For context, I grew up in an Asian household with strict, but fair and loving parents. I was your typical student who got A's and B's up until my sophomore year in HS where I basically gave up on it. Grades dropped and did only the very bare minimum to breeze through with a low C. I eventually only graduated because of COVID when my HS put in some VERY lenient standards for its students (for example, there was nothing that could lower your grade in classes. Not doing homework? Not showing up to those zoom calls? Perfect, my C in that class would remain unchanged). Woohoo class of 2020.

Skipped the fall 2020 semester at my local CC because of my laziness and irresponsibility to register early. I did my first semester in Spring the following year and failed all my classes. Now I just missed this year's fall semester again because of the same reason before.

Now, I'm unemployed with no driver's license. I have my fourth try in a couple weeks (I failed twice for stupid mistakes, and I couldn't even take it the third because my brakelight went out). All I do is sleep, play video games, watch porn, sleep, repeat. I have a horrible sleeping schedule (sleep at 4 AM, wake up at 2 PM).

I've now realized that I'm a useless piece of shit mooching off of my parents with no sense of direction in life. I blame no one for how I am right now. This was all my fault and I'm struggling to improve.

I'm slowly starting to fix my sleeping schedule, I'm making sure to do chores at home because I don't leave the house anyways, I'm working out to at least improve my physique and mental health, I'm making the effort to push the porn aside because that shit's a virus, but even after all that, I feel like I'm already doomed in life.

tl;dr: unemployed 19 year old kid who can't grow up, nearly flunked HS and fucked up college and now feeling useless","don't worry man, you can fix the situation up no problem, you will have to get tough with yourself though.  the most important thing is consistency, every single day you have to accomplish at least one productive thing.  even if it's just baby steps at first, force yourself to do AT LEAST one good thing, you can badger yourself to do it especially if it's just one baby step.  after a couple weeks and months of this you will have a snowball effect, all the benefits of your steps begin adding on top of each other and it becomes exponential growth.  this is the method I used to get myself out of a bad run, and i was older than you, so don't fret, just get to work and hold yourself accountable.","I have your same story. Roughly. (I am not Asian and I got far worse grades than you)

 Things that helped:

1. Adopt responsibility for a few things where people *really* rely on you to show up. This could be a job for a small business. This could be volunteering someplace. Whatever it is there has to be real negative consequences if you don't show or if you call in sick. It'll get you going so the days don't just slide by. It is a huge boost to have people rely on you and to be contributing in a real way to helping other people succeed. Progressively adopt more and more responsibility. It changes everything. 
2. Definitely quit the porn and probably the video games. Too much easy dopamine. Dopamine is what will get you out of bed and looking for work, trying new things, meeting people, etc. You don't want to use all of it up on stuff that isn't moving you forward.
3. You are on the right track with a predictable and consistent daily schedule and some fitness habits. That made a big difference. I'm just not sure I could have implemented this without also doing #1 above.
4. As soon as possible, move out of your parents house. Its just too hard to be yourself, take responsibility, and to contribute when you live with your parents. Or it was for me. I found a friend/coworker looking for a roommate to share the rent. This is part of number one.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're recognizing where you want to make changes—that's a huge first step. You're definitely not doomed; you're just at the beginning of figuring things out, and that's okay. Here are a few things you might find helpful:

1. **Small Steps**: Focus on making small, manageable changes. You're already working on your sleep schedule and chores, which is awesome. Keep building on those small wins. Maybe set a goal to wake up 15 minutes earlier each week until you reach a time that feels productive for you.

2. **Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn't have to be rigid, but having a general plan for your day can help you feel more in control. Include time for exercise, chores, and maybe a new hobby or skill you want to learn.

3. **Driver's License**: Keep at it with the driving test. It's frustrating, but passing it will give you more independence and open up job opportunities. Make sure your car is in good shape before the test to avoid any more hiccups.

4. **Education and Work**: Consider reaching out to your local community college about re-enrolling. They might have resources to help you get back on track. Also, look into part-time jobs or volunteer work to gain experience and build a routine.

5. **Limit Distractions**: You're already working on cutting down on porn and video games. Keep setting limits for yourself, like only playing games after you've completed certain tasks.

Remember, you're still young, and there's plenty of time to turn things around. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","First off - you haven't screwed up your life. At 19, you're just getting started, and recognizing where you want to improve is actually a huge first step that many people don't take until much later.

The fact that you're already working on your sleep schedule, doing chores, and exercising shows you've got the right mindset. These are exactly the kind of small, consistent changes that build into bigger improvements. Keep building on these wins.

Here's what I'd suggest focusing on next: Get that driver's license. You've already taken it three times, so you know what to expect. Study the common mistakes, practice the specific areas where you struggled, and knock it out. Having your license will open up more opportunities for both work and independence.

For college - most community colleges have academic counselors who specifically help students who've had a rough start. Set up an appointment with one. They can help you create a realistic plan to get back on track, and might even be able to help you appeal those failed grades. Lots of students struggled during COVID - you're not alone in this.

The key is to tackle one thing at a time. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick your next goal (like that driver's license), break it down into small daily tasks, and focus on those. Once you've got that handled, move on to the next thing.

You're already making positive changes. That's not someone who's ""doomed"" - that's someone who's starting to take control of their life. Keep building on that momentum, one step at a time.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge where you're at and take responsibility for your actions, so kudos to you for that. It's great that you're making an effort to improve your sleeping schedule, doing chores, working out, and cutting back on porn - those are all positive steps towards building discipline and self-care.

Rather than focusing on feeling ""doomed,"" try to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. What's the next step you can take towards getting your life on track? Is it studying for your driver's license test, looking for job openings, or registering for classes again? Having a clear plan and taking things one step at a time can make your situation feel less overwhelming.

Remember that everyone's journey is different, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out. You're not defined by your past mistakes, and you have the power to create positive change in your life. Don't be too hard on yourself - instead, focus on making progress and celebrating small wins along the way. You got this, and it's never too late to start building a better future for yourself.","Hey man, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're even writing this post shows you're not giving up on yourself, which is huge. Seriously.

First off, cut yourself some slack. 19/20 is a weird age. You're figuring things out, and a lot of people feel lost. Don't compare yourself to some ideal you think you should be.

It's awesome you're already tackling the sleep schedule, chores, working out, and porn. Those are all great starting points. Small wins build momentum.

Here's my advice: focus on *one* thing at a time. You mentioned the driver's license. Nail that. Seriously, make it your mission. Study the handbook, watch YouTube videos, practice driving every day if you can. Getting that license will be a tangible win and give you a confidence boost. Plus, it opens up job opportunities.

Once you have that license, start looking for *any* job. Seriously, anything. Even if it's just a few hours a week. The point is to get you out of the house, interacting with people, and earning your own money. It doesn't have to be your dream job, just something to get you moving.

As for college, don't write it off completely, but don't stress about it right now. Focus on getting your life in order first. Once you have a job and a routine, you can start thinking about taking a class or two at CC.

The key is small, consistent steps. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one thing, focus on it, and build from there. You got this.

t3_pubejw,[Need Advice] How to I get out of bed early in the morning easily?,"From this month my university has started and because of that I have moved into the college hostel but here I am finding it hard to wake up in the morning. At home I was able to get out of bed at 4 because of my parents but here even though I wake up at 6 am, I am lying in the bed till 7:30 am. Now I want to reach library by 8 am so I am able to study till 10 am and then classes but this gets me late a lot. So if you have any idea how do I deal with this then comment it.","Ive done this before. I used to set my alarm on the most alarming sound as possible. Have my phone on the opposite side of the room. This forces me to get up to turn it off. 

Do some light workouts like sit-ups l, pushups, run in place crunches etc.
Gets the blood pumping.","So you’re awake in bed for 90 minutes? What are you doing? Reducing your access to whatever it is would be a good first step.

Can you find a way so you have to get out of bed and dressed? For instance, instead of brewing coffee in your room, brew it in the common area or go to a coffee shop, so you have to be up and dressed and out of bed.

Can you find someone else in the same situation? Agree to meet, and then you don’t want to let them down.

Last resort: self-bribery. If you make it to the library every day for a week, you will treat yourself somehow.","Hey there! Waking up early can be tough, especially when you're adjusting to a new environment. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Set a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.

2. **Create a Morning Routine**: Having a routine can give you something to look forward to. Maybe start with a quick stretch or a glass of water to kickstart your day.

3. **Use an Alarm Clock Strategically**: Place your alarm clock across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. This can help you resist the temptation to hit snooze.

4. **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: The blue light from screens can interfere with your sleep. Try to wind down with a book or some relaxing music instead.

5. **Find an Accountability Partner**: Maybe a friend or roommate who also wants to wake up early. You can motivate each other to stick to your goals.

Remember, it might take some time to adjust, so be patient with yourself. Good luck with your studies!","Getting out of bed immediately is tough for most people, especially without external accountability like parents. Here's what's worked really well for me and others:

Put your phone/alarm across the room so you physically have to get up to turn it off. Once you're standing, half the battle is won. 

The other key is to make your morning routine something you actually look forward to. Maybe start with 5 minutes of light stretching, put on your favorite music, or treat yourself to a special morning drink. Having a compelling reason to get up makes a huge difference.

Also, the morning really starts the night before. Try to get to bed at a consistent time that gives you 7-8 hours of sleep. Your body will naturally start waking up earlier once you establish a rhythm.

For the first week, you might need to be a bit extreme - set multiple alarms, have a friend call you, or even arrange to meet someone at the library at 8am sharp. Once you build the habit and experience the benefits of those productive morning hours, it gets much easier to maintain.

Remember that it's normal to need 2-3 weeks to cement a new habit. Stay consistent and don't beat yourself up if you slip up occasionally. You've already shown you can wake up early - now it's just about creating the right environment and systems to make it happen consistently.","Waking up early can be tough, especially when you're in a new environment. One strategy that might help is to establish a consistent morning routine that you enjoy, so you've got something to look forward to as soon as you wake up. This could be as simple as making yourself a cup of coffee or tea, doing some quick exercises, or reading something inspiring. Try to make your mornings feel rewarding, rather than just a chore to get to the library. 

Also, since you're used to waking up at 4 am at home, waking up at 6 am might feel like sleeping in, which could be contributing to your tendency to hit the snooze button. You might want to try setting your alarm 15-30 minutes earlier each day and see if you can gradually train yourself to get out of bed as soon as it goes off. Additionally, make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, as lack of sleep can make it harder to wake up in the morning. 

Lastly, consider making a plan for your morning the night before, including what time you need to wake up, what you'll do as soon as you get out of bed, and what you need to bring with you to the library. Having a clear plan can help you stay on track and make it easier to get out of bed when your alarm goes off. Good luck with your university life and I hope you're able to develop a morning routine that works for you!","Hey, I get it, hostel life can throw off your routine! Waking up is tough when you don't have that parental nudge. Here's a few things that might help:

First, try setting an alarm and putting your phone across the room. That forces you to physically get up to turn it off. Once you're up, you're less likely to crawl back into bed.

Second, have something you're actually looking forward to doing in the morning. Maybe it's a specific chapter you want to read, or a coffee you really enjoy. Having a reason to get up makes it easier.

Third, prep the night before. Lay out your clothes, pack your bag, maybe even make your lunch. The less you have to think about in the morning, the smoother your transition to the library will be.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It takes time to adjust to a new environment and build new habits. Don't get discouraged if you slip up, just keep trying! Good luck with your studies!

t3_y0vssv,[need advice] how do I force myself to get up early?,I’ve tried everything. I’m on a path to self discipline myself and I’ve been successful in mostly everything other than this. I go to bed telling myself I will get up early no matter what but the moment the alarm hits my ears I simply do nothing.,"It’s really unhealthy that all the “go to bed earlier” replies are sat at the bottom of the thread with a tiny number of votes (or even being downvoted) - while all the “tricks” are being upvoted to the top.

People need enough sleep. Getting up earlier means going to bed earlier. Sleep deprivation isn’t a badge of honour that shows how “disciplined” you are - it’s incredibly bad for your physical and mental health and means you’re _less_ productive despite being awake for more hours, resulting in a net loss of productivity.

If you can’t get up:

- go to bed earlier so you get more sleep
- get better quality sleep by cutting out/down alcohol, caffeine, screen time, light in the room etc.","Wishing you the best on the sleep health journey. 

Dr. Andrew Huberman has had Matt Walker on his pods about sleep (I haven’t watched/listened, but that may or may not be of interest to you), and Rich Roll has a great episode with Matt Walker that I just finished and found useful. 

One of the interesting points that was mentioned in their convo was that *a lot* of sleep issues are behavioural (meaning, we thankfully have the power to fix them), but that these behavioural effects are difficult to parse from the biological effects that create true sleep disorders. 
TLDR: the only way to know how screwed up your sleep really is, is to optimize all the behavioural aspects of sleep that you actually have control over and then see how much better your sleep situation can get.","Getting up early can be tough, but there are a few strategies that might help. First, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock. Gradually adjust your wake-up time by 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal. Also, consider placing your alarm across the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. This can help break the cycle of hitting snooze. Lastly, make your mornings something to look forward to by planning a small reward or enjoyable activity right after you wake up. Consistency is key, so keep at it, and you'll likely see progress over time!","Getting up early is tough, but it's definitely something you can master with the right approach. The key is to make it easier for your morning self to succeed rather than relying on willpower alone.

First, work backwards from your wake time to set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep. Your body clock needs regularity to adapt. Even on weekends, try not to deviate by more than an hour.

Put your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up. The moment your feet hit the floor, immediately walk to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face. This combination of movement and sensation helps shake off the grogginess.

What helped me was having a specific reason to get up early - something more compelling than just ""I should."" Maybe it's hitting the gym when it's empty, enjoying a peaceful breakfast, or getting a head start on work. Whatever motivates you.

Also, make your bedroom a wake-up friendly environment. Get a sunrise alarm clock or put your lights on a timer. The gradual increase in light helps your body transition naturally from sleep. Keep the room slightly cool too - it's harder to get up when you're cozy and warm.

Remember that the first week will be the hardest. Push through those initial days and it gets significantly easier as your body adjusts to the new schedule. You've already shown you can build discipline in other areas - this is just another skill to master.","One strategy that might help is to start small and set a ridiculously achievable goal, like getting out of bed 15 minutes earlier each day. This can help build momentum and make the task less daunting. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're struggling to get up early - is it because you're not getting enough sleep, or is it because you don't have a compelling reason to get out of bed? Once you understand the root cause, you can develop a plan to address it. For example, if you're not a morning person, try setting a goal that's rewarding to you, like enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or doing some stretching exercises. It's also important to create an environment that supports your goals, such as placing your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Remember, developing self-discipline is a process and it's okay to take it one step at a time - don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results.","Hey, I get the early morning struggle. It's a tough one! Since you've been successful with discipline in other areas, let's try to apply some of that here.

First, make sure your bedtime is realistic. If you're trying to jump from 6 hours of sleep to 8 and wake up super early, your body will fight you. Gradual adjustments are key.

Second, what's the *very first* thing you need to do when you get up? Don't think about the whole day, just that first action. Maybe it's drinking a glass of water you left by your bed, or putting on your workout clothes. Make it something small and easy to accomplish.

Third, consider the alarm itself. Is it too easy to snooze? Experiment with different sounds, or even better, put your alarm across the room so you *have* to get out of bed to turn it off.

Finally, and this is important: reward yourself! What's a small, enjoyable thing you can do *immediately* after getting up that you look forward to? Coffee? A few minutes of reading? Link that reward to the act of getting up, and it'll become much easier. Good luck, you got this!

t3_sfvs5f,[Need Advice] My sleep schedule is flipped and the lies I’m telling to avoid anyone finding out is ruining my life,"I’ve been chronically sleep deprived since March 2020. Up until recently I would get 3-5 hours a night for 1-2 weeks before it all caught up and I’d have a 24+ hour sleep. I was going to bed like 2-4am and waking up at 8am to get to work by 9am.

Well since I went back to school in September I no longer have any structure in my life as everything is online and pre recorded. I was still going to bed by 4-5am and wake up for 11am.

January, things have changed. I don’t remember the last time I went to bed without the sun in my eyes. I’m sleeping at 7am-10am and waking up like 4-6pm everyday. I keep missing my one non-recorded class. I’m depressed because I wake up and it’s dark. And when I have plans at, for example, 6pm, and I wake up at 5:45, I have to make up an excuse bc the truth is too embarassing. I’ve been making up excuses since 2020 but I could also tell the truth sometimes since waking up at 12 can be understandable, especially bc I was working ~60hrs/week.

Now I’ve got all these lies and it’s hard to keep track of what I’ve said. Add in the sleep deprivation and I don’t even remember saying half of them, and if any are actually true. Im so sick of being like this but every time i reset my sleep schedule it’s messed up again within a day. One time i started my day at 4am and still went to bed at 7am the next morning. Please help me. Also I have ADHD which I know is a large contributing factor","You’re right, a lot of people with ADHD have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS)! It sounds like you were really burned out too and you were likely experiencing revenge bedtime procrastination. I wouldn’t be surprised if you were left feeling under stimulated and unable to sleep by the end of the day because of having to work so many hours without getting to do anything personally interesting?     
    
Anyway, it sounds like maybe you should just come clean to some people about what’s been going on if you can. Sometimes we just have to swallow our pride and expose the embarrassing truth because we need help. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Please be kind to yourself, because it sounds like you’ve been trying your best and it’s been really difficult!    

Also, have you considered getting professional help from a therapist? If you find the right one, they’re great for helping to teach the right tools to keep yourself from spiraling into bad situations like that and managing ADHD. And also the depression. I’ve been there, and I know it’s not fun, and I know that it can be hard to take the initiative to try to make things better on your own, so consider getting help!    

Maybe also try posting this to the ADHD sub, as I’m sure you’re not alone in this. I’m not the best with sleep hygiene myself, given that I also have ADHD.

Edit: as another commenter said: exercise is important! Never used to like to do it, but I sleep so much better and I actually really like working out now. Provides some good stimulation for that ADHD brain!","Hey brother wow I’m exactly the same. It’s almost like I’m wired to be awake at night still alert. I don’t like winters either short days. My advice to myself & you is to put an alarm 30 minutes earlier everyday & put timer when using phone at night. Eat healthy, must exercise to get tired 😴. Socialize when you can to destres","Hey there! It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule, and it's understandable how that can spiral into other areas of life. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:

1. **Gradual Adjustment**: Instead of trying to reset your sleep schedule all at once, try shifting it gradually. Aim to go to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can be more sustainable and less jarring for your body.

2. **Consistent Routine**: Establish a consistent bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, taking a warm shower, or practicing relaxation techniques.

3. **Limit Screen Time**: Try to reduce exposure to screens at least an hour before bed. The blue light emitted by phones and computers can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

4. **Natural Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure during the day, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your internal clock and improve your mood.

5. **Accountability**: Consider sharing your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware of your efforts can be motivating.

6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned ADHD, it might be worth discussing your sleep issues with a healthcare professional. They can offer tailored advice and support.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!","Hey there - this is a tough situation but it's fixable. The combination of no structure, ADHD, and a completely flipped sleep schedule is creating a nasty cycle, but let's break this down into manageable steps.

First, you need to pick a realistic wake time and stick to it no matter what. Not 4am - that's too aggressive. Maybe start with 11am since that worked better for you before. Get a super loud alarm and put it across the room so you physically have to get up.

The key is to stay up the entire day after you wake up. No naps. It'll suck for 1-2 days but it's necessary. As soon as you wake up, get outside for at least 15 minutes of sunlight. This helps reset your circadian rhythm. 

For the first few days, take melatonin about 2 hours before your target bedtime (aim for midnight initially). The goal is to gradually move your schedule earlier, not fix it all at once.

To maintain the schedule, you need some daily structure. Even with online classes, set specific times to watch lectures, do coursework, etc. Put everything in your calendar and treat it like real appointments. This is especially important with ADHD - external structure is your friend.

About the lies - people are generally understanding about sleep issues. You don't have to share details, but a simple ""I've been struggling with my sleep schedule and working to fix it"" is better than keeping track of multiple stories.

The most important thing is to be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. Your body will eventually adjust, but you have to push through those first few difficult days. You've got this - one step at a time.","It sounds like you're really struggling with your sleep schedule and the lies you've been telling to cover it up are adding to your stress. First, let's tackle the sleep issue - with your ADHD, it might be helpful to establish a consistent daily routine that doesn't rely on willpower alone. Consider setting multiple alarms throughout the day to help regulate your wake-up time, and try to get some morning sunlight exposure as soon as you wake up to help reset your circadian rhythms.

Since you've been able to wake up at 8am for work in the past, you might be able to use that as a reference point to start rebuilding your schedule. Try setting a realistic goal, like waking up at 10am or 11am, and gradually adjust it to an earlier time as your body adjusts. It's also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches.

As for the lies, it might be helpful to start small by being honest with one person you trust about your situation. This can help take some of the weight off your shoulders and give you a sense of accountability. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're not alone in struggling with sleep and ADHD - many people have been in your shoes before. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up, just acknowledge the setback and try to get back on track as soon as possible. You got this, and it's great that you're taking the first step by reaching out for help.","Hey, that sounds really rough, and it's totally understandable you're feeling overwhelmed. Sleep issues are brutal, especially with ADHD in the mix. It's great that you're reaching out and recognizing you want to change things.

First, stop beating yourself up about the lies. It's a coping mechanism, and now you're ready to move past it. The important thing is to focus on building a consistent routine.

Since you mentioned ADHD, have you explored strategies specifically for sleep with ADHD? Things like a super consistent bedtime routine (even on weekends), blackout curtains, white noise, and avoiding screens an hour or two before bed can make a difference. Melatonin might help, but definitely talk to your doctor about that, especially given your ADHD.

The biggest thing is consistency. Even if you have a terrible night, try to wake up at the same time. It sucks at first, but it's key to resetting your circadian rhythm. Maybe aim for a slightly earlier wake time each day, even by 15-30 minutes, until you get closer to a reasonable hour.

Also, think about light exposure. Get bright light first thing when you wake up (a sunlight lamp can be a lifesaver in winter). And try to avoid bright light in the evening.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It's not going to fix itself overnight. Celebrate small wins, and don't get discouraged if you slip up. Just get back on track the next day. You got this!

t3_rjx1sr,[Need Advice] how can i stop believing that procrastination and mind numbimg pleasure is good,"Whenever im about to do some work i keep getting distracted (i kinda need the internet and my phone for/study) i always start to side track and i feel like i should just put off the work and do something fun and easier even when im literally bored i still indulge in mind numbing pleasure and convince myself that this is not right and that getting things done is important for me and would benefit me more then any sort of short term pleasure
I always convince myself that indulging in mind numbing pleasure is better then any long term goal
I always expect some sort of reward instantly for my work even if the work is very little how can i make it so that i dont expect instant gratification","The more progress you make, the greater the results. The greater the results, the less you will procrastinate. The hardest part is the first bit of work until you reach your first true reward. Then it gets a bit easier.","this is what people call a dopamine detox  
your brain has dopamine receptors that get used to appealing things, making actually productive shit less appealing

if you take some time off so your brain can get used to doing absolutely nothing appealing, things will be less of a burden to do","It sounds like you're dealing with the classic struggle between short-term pleasure and long-term goals. One thing that might help is to start small and build momentum. Try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes to focus on your work. Often, just getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, it becomes easier to keep going. Also, consider rewarding yourself after completing a task, but make sure the reward is something that doesn't derail your progress. Over time, this can help train your brain to associate work with positive outcomes. Lastly, try to identify specific triggers that lead to procrastination and find ways to minimize them, like using apps that block distracting sites or setting your phone to ""Do Not Disturb"" mode while studying. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Keep at it!","The key is understanding that your brain has been trained to seek quick dopamine hits, but you can gradually retrain it. Start by breaking your work into smaller chunks - like 25 minute focused sessions followed by a 5 minute break (look up the Pomodoro Technique). This gives you more manageable goals and regular ""rewards.""

For phone/internet distractions, use website blockers and put your phone in another room while working. Only bring it back during designated break times. This creates a physical barrier between you and the temptation.

To tackle the instant gratification mindset, try keeping a ""wins journal."" At the end of each day, write down what you accomplished and how it moves you toward your bigger goals. This helps connect your daily efforts to the long-term rewards. You could also set up small rewards for hitting study milestones - like ""after 2 hours of focused work, I can watch one episode of my favorite show.""

Remember that discipline is like a muscle - it gets stronger with consistent training. Don't expect perfection right away. Start with small changes and build up gradually. The satisfaction of actually getting things done will eventually become more rewarding than the temporary pleasure of procrastination.

What specific task are you working on right now? Maybe we can break it down into more manageable steps to help you get started.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common challenge - prioritizing short-term pleasure over long-term goals. One strategy that might help is to set clear, achievable goals for yourself and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and more rewarding, even if the reward isn't immediate. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're seeking instant gratification - are you bored, stressed, or feeling overwhelmed? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can develop strategies to address those feelings in healthier ways. For example, you could try taking regular breaks to do something enjoyable, but still productive, like going for a walk or practicing a hobby. This can help you feel like you're getting a reward without derailing your progress. It might also be helpful to establish some ground rules for yourself when it comes to using the internet and your phone while studying - like setting a specific block of time where you'll focus on work, and then taking a break to check your phone or browse the internet. Remember that developing discipline and new habits takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't get too discouraged if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough to fight that urge for instant gratification, especially when work feels hard and distractions are so easy to access.

One thing that might help is breaking down your work into *really* small, manageable chunks. Like, instead of ""study for 2 hours,"" try ""read one page of notes"" or ""solve one practice problem."" The smaller the task, the less daunting it feels, and the quicker you get that little sense of accomplishment.

Also, since you need the internet and your phone for studying, try using website blockers or apps that limit your time on distracting sites. Schedule specific times for breaks where you *can* indulge in those pleasures, but keep them separate from your work time. Knowing you have a reward coming up can make it easier to focus.

Finally, try to reframe your thinking about work. Instead of seeing it as a chore, try to connect it to your long-term goals. How will this studying help you achieve something you really want? Visualizing that future success can be a powerful motivator. It's a process, so be patient with yourself and celebrate the small wins!

t3_13ck4nk,[need advice] how to stop feeling drowsy and sleepy mid-day?,"Took my first steps in waking up at 5 am, and I’ve been doing so for the past 3 weeks. But the problem is that at around 11-12 pm, I’d literally be on the verge of shutting down, my focus on studying becomes nil, and productivity plummets down so hard. Any tips to help boost studying productivity?","I suffer from same thing and I’ve come to realise that whenever i feel sleepy, i set an alarm and take a quick nap for 15-20 mins.
Sometimes I do this 2-3 times a day, whenever i feel like extremely sleepy. After the nap, except initial minutes of struggle, i feel rejuvenated.
It works for me.
You might as well give it a try!",A couple hours more of sleep will make your day more productive than 2 hours of study when you are exhausted.,"Congrats on sticking with the 5 am wake-up routine for three weeks! That's a solid start. Feeling drowsy mid-day is pretty common when adjusting to a new sleep schedule. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Sleep Quality**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep at night. If you're waking up at 5 am, aim for a bedtime that gives you 7-9 hours of sleep. Quality matters too, so try to keep your sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet.

2. **Morning Routine**: Start your day with some light exercise or stretching. This can help wake up your body and mind, setting a positive tone for the day.

3. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Drink water first thing in the morning and keep hydrated throughout the day. Eating a balanced breakfast with protein and complex carbs can also help maintain your energy levels.

4. **Breaks and Movement**: Incorporate short breaks into your study sessions. A quick walk or some light stretching can boost your energy and focus.

5. **Power Nap**: If possible, a short nap (10-20 minutes) around midday can recharge you without affecting your nighttime sleep.

6. **Caffeine Timing**: If you use caffeine, try to have it in the morning and avoid it in the afternoon to prevent disrupting your sleep cycle.

Adjusting to a new routine takes time, so be patient with yourself. Keep experimenting with these strategies to see what works best for you. Good luck!","Congrats on sticking with the 5am wake-up for 3 weeks - that's already a solid achievement! The mid-day crash you're experiencing is pretty common when adjusting to early mornings. Here's what can help:

First, make sure you're actually getting enough total sleep. Even with a 5am wake-up, you should aim for 7-8 hours, which means lights out by 9-10pm. No screens for at least 30 mins before bed.

For the mid-day slump specifically: Try taking a 15-20 minute power nap around 10:30am (before the crash hits). This can be incredibly refreshing and won't interfere with nighttime sleep. If naps aren't possible, get up and do 5 minutes of physical activity - jumping jacks, quick walk, or stretching when you start feeling drowsy.

Your eating patterns matter too. Have a protein-rich breakfast and avoid heavy carb-loaded lunches that'll make you sleepy. Keep healthy snacks like nuts or fruit handy for steady energy. Stay hydrated throughout the day.

Consider breaking your study sessions into 45-minute chunks with 5-10 minute breaks. During peak drowsiness (11-12), switch to more active learning methods like explaining concepts out loud or working through practice problems instead of passive reading.

Give these adjustments a try for a week and see what works best for you. The body usually takes about a month to fully adapt to major schedule changes, so you're almost there!","It's great that you've been consistent with waking up at 5 am for 3 weeks - that's a big accomplishment. To combat mid-day drowsiness, have you considered taking a short walk or doing some light exercise around 10-11 am to get your blood flowing and oxygen levels up? Sometimes, a change of scenery or a bit of physical activity can help increase alertness. Additionally, make sure you're staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the morning, and try to avoid heavy meals or sugary snacks that can cause an energy crash later on. You might also experiment with taking a 10-15 minute power nap if you're feeling extremely fatigued, but set an alarm so you don't oversleep. As for studying productivity, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between - this can help you stay focused and retain information better. What's your current study routine like, and are there any specific subjects or tasks that seem to be causing your productivity to plummet?","Hey! Congrats on sticking with the 5 am wake-up for three weeks, that's a solid achievement! That mid-day slump is super common, especially when adjusting to a new sleep schedule.

A few things that might help: First, make sure you're getting enough *total* sleep. Even with the early wake-up, aim for 7-8 hours. Maybe you need to adjust your bedtime earlier to compensate.

Second, look at your diet. A heavy, carb-loaded lunch can definitely make you sleepy. Try something lighter with protein and healthy fats. Also, stay hydrated! Dehydration can mimic fatigue.

Third, consider a short break with some light exercise around 10:30-11 am. A quick walk, some jumping jacks, or even just stretching can really boost your energy levels.

Finally, experiment with different study techniques. If you're grinding for hours straight, your brain will naturally get tired. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break) to break things up. Good luck!

t3_qy30r8,[Need Advice] How to Overcome Self-Sabotage and the Fear of the unknown.,"It's almost two months from the day I told myself to change for the better, physically, mentally and academically. But as typical of me, I've done nothing but put it off. ""O I'll start Tomorrow, today my study table is not in order"" then tomorrow comes and I put it off to the next. In doing so I kinda lost believe and faith in myself.

I've basically wasted the last 6 years of my life. And I've gotten so accustomed to this current state of being--lazy, unmotivated, no plans, unemployed, obese, depressed,anxious--that any move towards a positive change scared me. Am afraid of change and what lies beyond. 

I know am supposed to be hitting the gym, I know am supposed to be ahead of the teacher, I know I should diet. But for some strange reason I can't move forward. It all sounds good in my head but I cant put it to action. its like am in invisible shackles.  So far am 20 chapters behind and we're in the final stretch of the semester and am still procrastinating.

My self sabotage is beyond belief. I know what am supposed to do and I know how guilty I would feel if i don't do it. But I still don't do what's required of me.  
Also I got an extreme 12hr/day phone addiction. And am currently afraid for my future. Will I be stuck for the next 6 years?

And finally am afraid of what lies beyond, the uncertainty kills me. Am so deep into my comfort zone, which consists of nothing but bad habits,e.g in bed 24/7 with my phone glued to me. It feels like I've been stripped of my manhood. I'll always  choose the path of least resistance. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.","You need to realise that without trying, you will not change. Trying might feel scary and uncomfortable but you need to realise that without discomfort, no growth can happen. Don't plan to change everything at once. That just makes everything overwhelming. Start by doing one new thing, EVERY day. After a month, you might start noticing a change. That will give you some wins under your belt and you'll start believing that change is possible after all, which will give you energy to continue and expand to add another thing to your daily to do list. What you do and how often and how much is up to you. The more effort, the faster the results. The balancing act is adding a many things to your to do list without feeling overwhelm.","There is probably some inner resistance that is keeping you on this behavioral pattern. Chances are, you actually want to procrastinate. So, you need to understand what exactly you are resisting.

You can try the Cost-Benefit Analysis from CBT to see what is holding you back (Check out David Burns)  and whether it's really worth it or not.

Running away isn't the solution. You can run but you can't hide from your problems.

Cheers,","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. That’s a big step in itself. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you don’t have to tackle everything at once. Start small. Pick one thing you want to change and focus on that. Maybe it’s reducing your phone time by an hour a day or setting a timer for 10 minutes to tidy up your study space. Small wins can build momentum.

For the fear of the unknown, try to reframe it as curiosity. What if the changes you make lead to something amazing? You don’t have to have it all figured out. Just take one step at a time. Also, consider setting up some accountability. Maybe a friend or a study group can help keep you on track.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Change is hard, and setbacks are part of the process. Celebrate the small victories and keep moving forward. You’ve got this!","First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many people get stuck in these cycles of procrastination and self-sabotage, especially when facing big changes. The good news is you can absolutely break free from this pattern.

Start incredibly small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Instead of thinking about hitting the gym for an hour, commit to doing just 5 pushups today. Instead of trying to study for hours, commit to reading just one page. The key is making the initial action so ridiculously easy that your brain can't come up with excuses.

For your phone addiction, start by creating physical distance between you and your phone. Put it in another room when you sleep. Set specific times to check it. Use app blockers if needed. Each time you resist checking your phone, you're building that discipline muscle.

About those 20 chapters - break them into tiny chunks. Read one section, then take a 5-minute break. Don't think about all 20 chapters. Just focus on the next small piece in front of you.

The fear of change is normal, but remember: your comfort zone is actually pretty uncomfortable right now. You're not really comfortable - you're just familiar with the discomfort. Real comfort comes from knowing you're moving in the right direction, even if it's just baby steps.

Pick ONE thing to change this week. Just one. Make it tiny. Maybe it's drinking water first thing in the morning, or reading for 5 minutes before bed. Build from there. Success breeds success, and small wins lead to bigger ones.

You haven't lost your manhood or your potential. You're just stuck in a rut, and ruts can be climbed out of. Start climbing today, one small handhold at a time.","It sounds like you're really struggling with getting started and making progress towards your goals, and it's understandable that the fear of the unknown and self-sabotage are holding you back. One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks - instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of ""hitting the gym"" or ""being ahead of the teacher"", try setting a goal for yourself like ""go for a 10-minute walk today"" or ""read one chapter of my textbook tonight"". This can make it feel less daunting and more achievable. 

It's also important to recognize that you don't have to make all these changes at once - you can start with small steps, like putting your phone away for an hour a day or getting out of bed 30 minutes earlier than usual. And instead of beating yourself up over your phone addiction, try to see it as an opportunity to learn and grow - you could try replacing some of that phone time with something more productive, like reading or journaling.

As for the fear of what lies beyond, it might help to remind yourself that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and that it's okay to not have everything figured out. You don't have to have a perfect plan - just taking small steps towards your goals can help you build momentum and confidence. And it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around your ""comfort zone"" - instead of seeing it as a source of comfort, try to see it as a limitation that's holding you back.

Lastly, it might be helpful to find some accountability and support - whether it's a friend or family member, or an online community like this one. Having people to report to and get encouragement from can make a big difference in staying motivated and on track. Remember that overcoming self-sabotage and building new habits takes time and effort, but it's possible - and you've already taken the first step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed when you're trying to change a lot at once.

Instead of trying to overhaul everything immediately, how about focusing on one tiny win each day? Seriously, *tiny*. Like, instead of ""hit the gym,"" maybe it's just ""put on my gym shoes."" Or instead of ""diet,"" it's ""drink a glass of water before grabbing my phone."" These small victories build momentum and confidence.

Regarding the phone addiction, 12 hours is a lot. Try setting a timer for 30 minutes of focused phone use, then put it in another room for an hour. Gradually increase the ""away"" time. There are also apps that can help limit your usage.

As for the fear of the unknown, remember that *everyone* feels that way. You're not alone. Maybe try journaling about your fears. Writing them down can make them seem less scary. And instead of focusing on the big picture, concentrate on the next small step.

You mentioned being behind in your studies. Break down those 20 chapters into smaller, manageable chunks. Commit to reading just one section a day. Even a little progress is still progress.

Don't beat yourself up for past mistakes. The past is done. Focus on what you can control *today*. You've got this. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate every little victory. You're already on the right track by acknowledging the problem and seeking help. Good luck!

t3_pc5qcr,[Need Advice] What are some tips for people who can't sleep because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts?,"Lately I've been noticing that at nights I find myself unable to sleep and put my thoughts to rest. It's like all day I'm distracted by something but at nights the alone time makes me very anxious.

I fixate on my beating heart and overthink about it. Some nonsensical worry that if I stop focusing on it, it will stop.

There are other thoughts like that too.

I have tried guided meditation for sleep and other tricks but they don't always help.

Any tips from someone who experienced the same but got over it?","Sometimes when I can't sleep I picture a little stepladder having a conversation with a regular six foot ladder. They sort of walk around together and bullshit about whatever. They're friends and give each other advice sometimes, but mostly they just sort of hang out and talk about what they did, who used them for what, etc. Always makes me crash pretty fast.",What are you doing stepladder? :3,"I've been there, and it can be really tough. One thing that helped me was creating a consistent bedtime routine to signal to my brain that it's time to wind down. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock. Also, consider writing down your thoughts before bed. Sometimes just getting them out on paper can help clear your mind. If you find yourself fixating on your heartbeat, try focusing on your breath instead. Slow, deep breaths can be calming and help shift your focus. Lastly, limit screen time before bed, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep. It might take some time, but with consistency, these habits can make a difference. Hang in there!","Hey there - I dealt with similar sleep anxiety and intrusive thoughts, especially that hyper-awareness of bodily sensations at night. Here's what helped me break that cycle:

First, establish a proper wind-down routine that starts 1-2 hours before bed. The key is consistency. Put away screens, dim the lights, and do calm activities like reading or light stretching. This signals to your brain that it's time to shift gears.

Instead of trying to force yourself not to think about certain things (which usually backfires), try the ""worry journal"" technique. Before your bedtime routine, write down any anxious thoughts or concerns. This helps get them out of your head and onto paper, where you can deal with them tomorrow.

For the physical anxiety symptoms, try this breathing exercise: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Do this 4-5 times. It helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which naturally calms you down.

If you catch yourself fixating on your heartbeat or other sensations, gently redirect your attention to the feeling of your mattress supporting you, or the texture of your blanket. Don't fight the thoughts - just keep redirecting your focus whenever you notice them.

Remember that your heart is an autonomous organ that's been doing its job perfectly well your whole life, including every night while you sleep. Your attention isn't required for it to keep working.

Start implementing these strategies gradually. Pick one or two to try first, then add more as you get comfortable. It takes time to rewire these patterns, but it absolutely can be done with consistent practice.","I've been in similar shoes and it can be really tough to break the cycle of anxiety and intrusive thoughts at night. One thing that helped me was to establish a consistent bedtime routine that signals to my brain that it's time to wind down - this could be as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some light stretches. The key is to find something that relaxes you and doesn't involve screens for at least an hour before bed. 

Regarding your fixation on your heartbeat, it might be helpful to try a technique called ""paradoxical intention"" - instead of trying to distract yourself from the sensation, deliberately focus on it, but with a twist: try to observe it without any judgment or attachment. Tell yourself that it's okay to feel your heart beating, and that it's a normal, natural sensation. This can help take away some of the anxiety associated with it.

It's also worth considering keeping a thought journal beside your bed, where you can jot down any intrusive thoughts that come up as soon as you lie down. Sometimes getting them down on paper can help you process and release them, making it easier to clear your mind for sleep. Don't worry too much about the guided meditation not working every time - it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Keep trying different techniques, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. It takes time and patience to develop new habits and learn to manage anxiety, but it is possible to get there.","Hey, I've been there, and it sucks. That nighttime anxiety spiral is the worst. A few things that have helped me, and might be worth a shot for you:

First, try to establish a really solid wind-down routine. I know you've tried meditation, but maybe experiment with *when* you do it. Instead of right before bed, try an hour or two before. This gives your mind a chance to process things a bit earlier, rather than right when you're trying to shut down. Also, make sure your bedroom is a true sanctuary – cool, dark, and quiet.

Second, address the heart-fixation thing directly. It sounds weird, but sometimes acknowledging the absurdity of the thought helps. Tell yourself, ""Okay brain, I hear you, you're worried about my heart. But my heart is a machine, it's been doing this my whole life, and it's not going to stop just because I'm not thinking about it."" Sounds silly, but it can break the cycle.

Third, and this is the discipline part: if you're still awake after, say, 20-30 minutes, *get out of bed*. Don't just lie there stewing. Go to another room, read a boring book (not on a screen!), or do some light stretching. Only go back to bed when you feel genuinely sleepy. This helps your brain associate your bed with sleep, not anxiety.

Finally, if this is a persistent problem, consider talking to a doctor or therapist. They might have other strategies or be able to rule out any underlying medical issues. Good luck, you got this!

t3_qc1pcz,[Need Advice] I really want to start working out but going to the gym makes me conscious,"So I have always been a big guy and gaining all this weight throughout the years made me lose my self-confidence. I was riddled with anxiety, and I had given up on myself to be honest. But a health scare happened to me a few months ago and it woke me up and made me prioritize myself, especially my health. I recently started dieting, mostly just cutting out processed foods for now, and I am trying my best to keep doing it even though there are some temptations along the way. But sometimes it’s just so hard to ignore some cravings for unhealthy food and that frustrates me.

But aside from dieting, I also want to start working out since I know physical activity is really important in losing weight and improving your health. I have a spin bike and a treadmill at home that I use, but sometimes I get lazy and lose the will to move so I feel like I need some external motivation, that’s why I’m thinking of going to the gym. However, the mere thought of going there makes me anxious and conscious because of how I look. I need some advice guys. Thank you very much.","If you have issues with binging or your eating habits in general, you can go to a therapist for that for some help. Also, I understand that you feel self-conscious about going to the gym, and that’s what I felt too. If you’re really not comfortable with going to one, you can try getting a remote personal trainer from platforms like [Outright Fitness](https://outrightfitness.com/remote-training/) or [CoPilot](https://mycopilot.com/?r=1). You can start with that first until you’re finally comfortable and confident enough to go and workout in a gym. Just take your time and don’t pressure yourself.","Which is worse, your health scare or maybe someone judging you?

Put your earphones in, and take care of you. People there will be less judgmental than you think, they are usually glad to see you take the initiative and take control of your problems.","Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle. It’s not easy, but you’re already making progress by changing your diet and using the equipment you have at home. When it comes to the gym, remember that everyone is there for the same reason: to improve themselves. Most people are focused on their own workouts and not on others. If the gym still feels intimidating, maybe start by going during off-peak hours when it’s less crowded. You could also try group classes or find a workout buddy to make it more fun and less daunting. 

As for motivation, setting small, achievable goals can help. Celebrate the little victories, like completing a workout or resisting a craving. Over time, these small wins build up and boost your confidence. And remember, it’s okay to have off days. What matters is getting back on track. Keep pushing forward, and you’ll find your rhythm. You got this!","First off, congrats on taking those initial steps with your diet and having home exercise equipment - that's already more than many people start with. 

About the gym anxiety - this is super common, even among regular gym-goers. Here's what helped many others push through it: Most people at the gym are completely focused on their own workouts and progress. They're not judging others because they're too busy thinking about their own form, sets, or what they're going to do next.

For building confidence, try going during off-peak hours at first (usually early morning or late evening). This gives you space to get comfortable with the environment and equipment. You might also want to book a session with a trainer - they can show you proper form and help create a workout plan that matches your current fitness level.

As for staying consistent with both diet and exercise, external motivation is helpful but building habits is what really makes it stick. Start small - maybe commit to just 15 minutes at the gym three times a week. Once that becomes routine, gradually increase it. Same goes for diet - you're already cutting processed foods, which is great. Take it one small change at a time.

Remember that everyone at the gym started somewhere, and you have just as much right to be there working on your health as anyone else. The hardest part is walking through those doors the first few times - it gets easier with each visit.","It's great that you're taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle, especially after your health scare - that takes a lot of courage. Starting with diet changes is a good foundation, and now adding exercise is the next logical step. I totally get why going to the gym might be intimidating, especially when you're self-conscious about your appearance. Here's what might help: instead of focusing on how you look, try to focus on why you're there - to improve your health and feel better. Remember, everyone at the gym is there for their own reasons, and most people are too caught up in their own workouts to pay attention to others. You could also consider starting with small, manageable goals, like going to the gym at off-peak hours or finding a workout buddy who shares similar goals. Having a supportive community can make a big difference in staying motivated. As for your cravings, it might be helpful to find healthy alternatives that satisfy your cravings, so you don't feel deprived. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just get back on track and keep moving forward. You've already made some great progress with your diet, and with time and patience, you can develop a consistent workout routine that works for you.","Hey, congrats on making the decision to prioritize your health! That's a huge first step. It's totally understandable to feel anxious about the gym, especially when you're feeling self-conscious.

Since you have equipment at home, maybe start by setting really small, achievable goals. Like, ""I'll walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes"" or ""I'll do a 15-minute spin bike session"" three times a week. The key is consistency, not intensity, at first. Once you've built that habit, you can gradually increase the time or intensity.

For the gym anxiety, could you try going during off-peak hours when it's less crowded? Or maybe find a friend to go with you for support? Another option is to focus on learning a specific exercise routine beforehand so you feel more confident when you're there. There are tons of free workout videos online.

Regarding cravings, try to identify what triggers them. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know the trigger, you can find healthier ways to cope. Also, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Small changes add up over time! You got this!

t3_qiy0vv,"[Need Advice] After a month of studying, I think I'm Burned Out. What can I do? I literally feel physically too weak to do anything and would just lie in my bed","Lectures are getting annoying as they are ""dry"" af (only writing out really long and exhausting proofs, or professors who simply cannot fascinate someone)

And I start feeling like wanting to just lie in bed and to watch Netflix. If I sit at my desk, I feel so so tired and weak, even during lectures, I am having trouble even holding my pen and writing

(don't worry, I'm not sick, I feel 100% fine)

Coffee used to give me that kick in the a**, but it stopped working

What should I do to charge batteries?","Make sure you eat well and drink enough water, also get enough sleep.","I take one whole day off after a month of anatomy and physiology classes given by professors with deep accents, contemplating whether I should just quit or continue. It is okay to take a break. Sometimes we just need a rest. Maybe just acknowledging that we have a power to choose what we want with our life. So, all the best.","It sounds like you're hitting a wall, which is totally normal when you're pushing yourself hard. First, try to incorporate some short breaks into your study sessions. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) can help keep your energy up. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated—these basics can make a huge difference in how you feel. If coffee isn't doing it for you anymore, maybe try switching to green tea or just taking a brisk walk to get your blood flowing. Lastly, mix up your study routine. If lectures are dry, try supplementing with videos or podcasts that cover the same material but in a more engaging way. Remember, it's okay to take a step back and recharge. Your health and well-being come first!","It sounds like you're experiencing classic burnout from intense studying without proper recovery. The good news is this is totally fixable with some adjustments to your routine.

First, take a strategic break - not just Netflix, but actual recovery activities. Go for a 30-minute walk outside daily, do some light exercise, or try meditation. These activities help reset your mental state much better than passive entertainment.

For your lectures, try changing how you engage with the material. Instead of just writing everything down, focus on understanding the big picture first. Take rough notes during class, then spend 15 minutes after each lecture organizing them into a format that makes sense to you. This can make dry content more digestible.

When you return to studying, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. This prevents mental fatigue and makes the work feel more manageable. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer 30-minute break.

Regarding coffee - when it stops working, that's a sign you need real rest, not more stimulants. Try scaling back to just one cup in the morning, and replace other coffee breaks with water and short walks.

The key is to build sustainable study habits rather than pushing yourself to exhaustion. Start with 2-3 focused hours per day and gradually increase as your energy returns. Your body is telling you something - listen to it and adjust accordingly.","It sounds like you're hitting a wall after a month of intense studying. First, congratulations on recognizing the burnout - that's a huge step. Now, let's get you recharged. Have you considered taking breaks and mixing up your study routine? Sometimes, a change of scenery or a different approach can make a big difference. Try studying in shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between, where you do something completely unrelated to academics, like going for a walk or chatting with a friend. 

Also, it might be helpful to identify what specifically is causing the burnout - is it the material itself, the way it's being taught, or something else? If it's the dry lectures, see if you can find supplementary resources that make the topics more engaging, like video explanations or study groups. And don't rely solely on coffee for energy; try getting some fresh air, eating nutritious food, and staying hydrated. Exercise, even just a little each day, can also be a great energizer. Remember, taking care of your physical health is crucial for maintaining your mental stamina. You've got this, and it's okay to slow down and recharge - you'll come back stronger.","Hey, burnout is super common, especially when you're grinding hard. It sounds like you've hit that wall. First, don't beat yourself up about it. It's a sign you need to adjust, not that you're failing.

Since coffee isn't working, forcing yourself through probably won't either. Try actively resting. I mean *really* resting. Netflix is fine in moderation, but maybe try something that actually recharges you. Think a walk in nature, listening to music, or spending time with friends (doing something other than studying!).

For the lectures, could you try active recall *after* the lecture? Instead of just passively writing notes, try to summarize the key points in your own words later. It might make the lectures feel less like a slog if you know you'll be engaging with the material differently afterward. Also, see if you can find supplemental resources that explain the concepts in a more engaging way. Sometimes a different perspective can make all the difference.

Finally, break down your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks with short breaks in between. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break) can be surprisingly effective. Good luck, you got this!

t3_zo1su6,What are some things to do alone at night? [Need Advice],"So whenever I have a day off from work I like to spend time at the gym, spend time at a coffee shop learning stuff and take walks during the day. Although those are good things to do, when the night comes around I don't know what else to do since I did all the stuff I wanted during the day. I don't have any friends so I need some advice on what to do for fun outside of my house on a weekend night. Normally I get into my bad habits at night where I would just watch youtube videos and play video games with some people that may be ok to do but for me, I think it leads to more bad habits that I have like masturbation and watching porn because I get too comfortable at home and therefore start doing bad habits at night and then it leads me getting discouraged because of what I did. My goal is to get out of the house until it gets too late outside, like I said I don't want to be at home and try to replace a bad habit with a good habit because I usually do my good productive habits outside of the home and I treat my home as a place to relax and be comfortable, but I get too comfortable to the point that I start watching porn and eating junk food. So the only way I can avoid this is by leaving the house all day but my question is what are some things that I can do on a day off from work and on a weekend night alone?

Also, another question is what do you guys do on your day off from work or on the weekends to have fun? I don't want something like reading or learning since I already do that during the day.",There is nothing wrong with exercising at night,I love video games but have a hard time with “just one hour” bc I get so engrossed and have such a good time. I could (and have) play all day.,"Exploring new activities at night can be a great way to break out of those habits. Here are a few ideas you might find interesting: 

1. **Join a Class or Group**: Look for evening classes or meetups in your area. It could be anything from dance, art, or cooking classes to language exchange meetups. This not only keeps you busy but also helps you meet new people.

2. **Nighttime Photography**: If you have a camera or even a smartphone, try nighttime photography. Exploring your city or neighborhood at night can be a whole new experience and a creative outlet.

3. **Volunteer**: Some organizations have evening volunteer opportunities. It’s a fulfilling way to spend your time and can help you connect with others.

4. **Go for a Night Walk or Run**: If you enjoy walking during the day, try it at night. Just make sure to choose safe, well-lit areas. It can be quite peaceful and a good way to clear your mind.

5. **Visit a Late-Night Café or Bookstore**: Some places stay open late and can be a nice change of scenery. You can enjoy a drink, people-watch, or even write if you’re into journaling.

6. **Explore Local Events**: Check out local event listings for concerts, open mic nights, or other community events. It’s a good way to experience something new and maybe even discover a new hobby.

Remember, the key is to find activities that you genuinely enjoy and that keep you engaged. It might take some experimenting, but that’s part of the fun!","Here are some evening activities that can help you stay productive and avoid falling into those habits you're trying to break:

Evening classes are great - many community centers and gyms offer night programs like martial arts, dance, or cooking classes. These give you structure and let you develop new skills while meeting people.

If you enjoy being active, look for evening sports leagues or running groups. Many cities have recreational volleyball, basketball, or soccer leagues that play in the evenings. Some running stores organize evening group runs too.

For solo activities, try finding a 24-hour gym, taking night photography walks (cities look amazing at night), or finding a late-night cafe to work on creative projects. Some libraries and coffee shops are open late too.

You could also volunteer - lots of organizations need evening help, like animal shelters, food banks, or community centers. This gets you out of the house while doing something meaningful.

The key is having specific destinations and activities planned ahead of time. When you know exactly where you're going and what you're doing, you're less likely to default to staying home.

Remember that your home doesn't have to be just for ""relaxing"" - you can create different zones for different activities. But if getting out works better for you right now, that's totally valid. Focus on building that evening routine with activities you genuinely enjoy.","It sounds like you're looking for ways to stay engaged and avoid falling into bad habits on weekend nights. One approach could be to find activities that are similar to what you enjoy during the day, but with a nighttime twist. For example, instead of going to a coffee shop during the day, you could try visiting a board game cafe or an escape room at night. These types of places often have a social atmosphere, but you can still participate as a solo individual. 

Alternatively, you might consider exploring your local community's nightlife by attending concerts, comedy shows, or other events that interest you. Many cities also have nighttime walking tours or outdoor activities like stargazing that can be a great way to get out of the house and enjoy the evening. If you're looking for something more low-key, you could try visiting a bookstore or a record store that's open late, or even just taking a walk in a new neighborhood to discover new sights and sounds.

As for what others do on their days off, it really varies - some people enjoy outdoor activities like hiking or biking, while others might prefer visiting museums or trying out new restaurants. The key is to find things that you enjoy and that help you feel fulfilled, rather than just defaulting to habits that don't serve you well. It might take some experimentation to find what works for you, but it sounds like you're motivated to make a change, which is a great first step.","Hey, it sounds like you've got a good handle on identifying your triggers and are actively looking for solutions, which is awesome! It's great that you recognize the pattern of being home leading to unwanted habits.

For nighttime activities outside the house, how about exploring some options that are different from your daytime routine? Since you're already hitting the gym and learning, maybe try something more social or creative. Think about things like:

*   **Live music or open mic nights:** Even if you go alone, it's a chance to be around people and experience something new.
*   **Board game cafes:** Many have solo players nights or are just generally welcoming to newcomers.
*   **Night photography:** Grab your phone or a camera and explore your city's lights. It's a cool way to see familiar places in a new light.
*   **Volunteer:** Some organizations have evening opportunities, like serving meals or helping at animal shelters.

As for what I do on my days off, I'm a big fan of trying new restaurants or going to see movies (especially at those theaters with the comfy reclining seats!). Sometimes just wandering around a different part of town can be surprisingly fun.

The key is to experiment and find what clicks for you. Don't be afraid to try something and decide it's not for you – that's part of the process. Good luck, you got this!

t3_qkyqcp,[Need Advice] How to not doomscroll first thing in the morning?,"Hi guys, I usually wake up with my phone in hand because its my alarm and sometimes just head to social media apps and keep doom scrolling, sometimes I wake up with a little more intentionality and  I dont. 

Any tips on how I can continue using my phone as my alarm clock but not doom scroll first thing in the morning and just go take a shit like a normal person? Thanks.","Get a proper alarm clock and keep your phone away from where you sleep. Plus to train your mind not to be addicted to your phone, change the settings to black and white, it really helps. It’s a gradual process but it works.","On samsung you could set a Bixby routine or use Digital Wellbeing to disable all your doom scrolling apps.

Or you could uninstall all your doom scrolling apps, and log in through your browser if you really need them. That's what I've done and it's made social media less of a compulsive habit.","One simple trick is to put your phone across the room before you go to bed. This way, when your alarm goes off, you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. Once you're up, it's easier to resist the urge to crawl back into bed and start scrolling. You could also try setting a specific morning routine that you look forward to, like making a nice breakfast or doing a quick workout. Having something positive to focus on can help shift your attention away from your phone. If you still want to use your phone as an alarm, consider using apps that lock you out of social media for a set period after waking up. Good luck!","Here's what helped me break the morning doomscrolling habit - get a cheap alarm clock from Amazon (they're like $10-15) and charge your phone in another room overnight. This creates a physical barrier between you and social media first thing in the morning.

The key is making the desired behavior (getting up and starting your day) easier than the undesired behavior (scrolling). When your phone isn't right next to you, you have to actually get up and walk to it, which gives your brain a chance to wake up and make more intentional decisions.

If you absolutely must keep your phone as your alarm, try putting it across the room so you have to get up to turn it off. Then immediately go do your morning routine before touching any apps. You can also use app blockers that prevent social media access during certain hours - this adds another barrier between you and the scroll.

Remember that the first few minutes after waking really set the tone for your whole day. Instead of letting social media dictate that tone, take control by establishing a simple morning sequence - maybe just ""alarm off → bathroom → water → stretch"" to start. Keep it super basic at first and build from there once it becomes automatic.","One strategy you could try is setting your alarm across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off - this way, you're already up and moving before you even touch your phone. Alternatively, you could use an alarm app that has a feature like ""no snooze"" or one that requires you to complete a task before you can check your notifications. As for the doomscrolling itself, try setting a specific goal for your morning routine, like making your bed or brushing your teeth, and challenge yourself to get that done before you're allowed to check social media. It might also be helpful to replace the social media scrolling with something else, like reading a book, meditating, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee - give yourself something better to look forward to in the mornings.","Hey, I totally get the doomscrolling struggle. It's a tough habit to break! Here's a couple things that might help:

First, the classic: phone across the room. Seriously, if you have to physically get out of bed to turn off the alarm, you're already winning.

Second, try changing your phone's home screen. Bury those tempting social media apps in a folder on the *last* page. Replace them with something boring but useful, like a calendar or a notes app with your to-do list. Out of sight, out of mind (at least for a few crucial minutes).

Third, and this might sound weird, but try setting a *second* alarm for 15-20 minutes after your first one. Use that first alarm as the ""get out of bed"" alarm, and the second as a backup. Knowing you have a little buffer might reduce the anxiety that leads to scrolling.

Finally, and this is the most important: have a plan for what you *will* do instead of scrolling. ""Go take a shit like a normal person"" is a good start, but maybe add something else right after, like ""drink a glass of water"" or ""stretch for 5 minutes."" Having a positive alternative makes it way easier to resist the urge to doomscroll. Good luck!

t3_ulm73x,"[Need Advice] How to ""outgrow"" from being raised in a household that always yells at each other."," This only came up when a friend in a friend group spoke up about not liking when we joked about him. Im sure everyone has dealt with friendly banter but I guess it gets to some people. I've had shit said to me that I didn't appreciate but had to play off too.

This got me thinking about my family. Literally my entire life we would yell at each other. I Think its mainly my dads fault cuz hes got like a .004 second fuse and blows up at everything.

Once he yells I yell back and then if anyone else butts in they get yelled at and start yelling too. The thing is I've tried being calmer with my tone but either I get yelled at or I get frustrated and start yelling first.

The thing is no one ever hold grudges, but things get really heated really quick and a lot of shit is said that is almost instantly regret and I always worry if what I said might've like deeply hurt them.

I've been hurt by the things my parent yell at me but I always see it as a ""ah they didn't mean it, they only got heated.... right?""

I know this is bad and ""unhealthy"" but I don't know how to go around it. Being calm and polite to them doesn't work. Its really hard to not yell back when being yelled at too. Should I start ignoring them if they start yelling? Once the yelling starts I don't think I can keep calm...

I guess how are you supposed to react to being yelled without yelling yourself?","So in my toxic household, trying to disengage and not interact or sticking to the status quo always gave the same result. No matter how hard I tried, it actually seemed to set my parents off faster. But its good you see it and want to change it, that's huge. So congrats on that part. In my adult life I refuse to argue with people, and by extension be yelled at or yell back and forth. If it's something that needs to be talked about, it will be talked about after both parties take a breather and are at the point of actually talking to each other. Until then, the subject needs to be left alone. If it's something that can be left as ""agree to disagree"" then sometimes that is best. It wasn't an easy learning process, but I've learned you'll say things while angry that you don't necessarily mean and then that festers until it gets brought up. Normally out of nowhere. Learning to deal with your emotions so They don't control you in certain situations would help. That would differ from person to person though. But thats what helped me, and ultimately helped with me choosing not to argue with people. What others still continue to try and do is nothing I can control, remember that.","I came to live with my husband over 12 years ago. We were still bf and gf back then. I came from a yelling-everything family and I brought the yelling in this household too. It wasn't always arguing, but simply different views. 

I am maybe lucky to have the partner I do, that kept calm and never yelled back. Took me years to unlearn the yelling after over 20 years of it being something normal. These last 2 years I can't remember yelling once, but I might remember smth before these 2 years. 

It is an urge deep inside, but it comes easy with practicing few steps, especially when you are the one engaging someone else in conversation:

1. Think of what you need to say and if it is actually important saying. Sometimes we act out of impulse, giving 0 thoughts to how this might carry on. 

2. Do you really need a feedback on something or you already know what's to be expected from the other person? In the intimacy of a family, you already know, from past emcounters what the other person wants or needs or what view has. Some questions make others wander if you are actually listening to them and it gets frustrating to know you pay no attention and, coming back to them with a similar situation or question, may fuel some negative feeling. This is why thinking on past situations might help. 

3. Know, before engaging with anyone in a conversation, that voices might be raised. Allow yourself to calm down first (because knowing what will come will give you a start-up of your own ""bubbling"" even before you say the first word). It is important to forgive the other person even before they yell at you. It is even best when you go into a conversation with this positive attitude and no one is yelling. For me, this was amazing. Now I rarely feel joy about it :) ...well, because no one is yelling anymore these days haha!

4. Confirmation. This is important for a person that yells. Going into a conversation with this type of people (and I know, because I was one too) is to approve what they say if you indeed approve with them. This should be the only way to talk back to them before getting a chance to speek as well. Let them speak/yell what they need to ""let out"" and till they are finished, just tell them "" I agree with that view too"" (or something similar, depending what it is said), or even nodding helps, while they talk. This will defuse the state of mind they are in. When it is your turn to speak, start with letting them know you agree with what they said (it is even better if you actually say, word by word, what are you agreeing with), and then approach a different view ifbit is the case(smth like a question: ""what do you think if this happens"", "" I hear you and I think I need an advice if smth goes different, what should I do?""). But!!! Sometimes is ok if you let a period of time to cool and come back to them and just telling them you thought of what they said and then start with agreeing with their view/perspective. Afterwords bringing up other things you need to follow up with. Giving them the feeling they are important in any matter of your life is something they find peaceful and they will be in a different set of mind. 

In time, yelling family members will learn that they can talk to you in a different manner. They will come to you too and  the same ""lay-back"" situation you can apply. Even if they start yelling first and you don't have that thinking time ahead, you can just agree, trying to pay attention to the message itself and not letting your voice to get too high. You can actually ask them to let you think of what they ask you or tell you and reassure them that you will give your feedback. 

For you, dear OP, it will be easier to change than for them. They did not thought of change as you did. Asking them now to stop yelling is an insult and I'm sure you don't want them feel like this. They will see, little by little that you'll yell less and less and that you listen more and maybe, one day, they will change too. 

I can report now that my relationship with my family is yelling-free. They yell at each other sometimes, but in relationship with me, because I sticked with my plan, they stopped. And OP,  it is such a beautiful thing to have this type of conversations, even if we disagree with each other, no more yelling 🥳

You have a long way ahead of you if, you want to start this process. Think that it is possible, but allow it to get fixed in years too. It is not a ""out of nowhere"" thing. 

Please remember to be kind to yourself first of all. The way you described things I do too think that they love you and not everything that they yell is meant to harm you (actually nothing is). Listen to the message, not the voice. 

I hope this works out for you and your loved ones :) because one day, dear redditor, you will feel as I do and I promise, it is SO WORTH IT! 

I wish you best of luck and a happy life! 😇✌","Growing up in a household where yelling is the norm can definitely make it tough to break the cycle, but it's great that you're aware and want to change it. One thing that might help is to practice pausing before responding. When someone starts yelling, take a deep breath and count to five in your head. This can give you a moment to decide how you want to respond rather than just reacting. It might also help to have a phrase ready, like ""I want to talk about this, but not while we're yelling,"" and then step away if you need to. Over time, this can help you build the discipline to stay calm even when others aren't. It might not change your family's behavior right away, but it can help you feel more in control and less reactive. Also, consider talking to your family about how the yelling affects you when things are calm. They might not realize the impact it has. Keep at it, and remember that change takes time.","Breaking the yelling cycle is really challenging, especially when it's been the normal way of communicating for so long. The key is to recognize that you can only control your own responses, not anyone else's.

One effective technique is to practice the ""grey rock"" method when others start yelling. This means becoming as unreactive and uninteresting as possible - keeping your voice steady and calm, using short responses, and avoiding getting pulled into the emotional escalation. It takes practice, but it works because yelling usually feeds off the other person's reaction.

When you feel yourself getting triggered, try taking a deep breath and counting to 5 before responding. If you need to, it's perfectly okay to say ""I need a minute"" and step away until you can respond calmly. This isn't running away - it's giving yourself space to break the pattern.

For the long term, consider learning some basic meditation or mindfulness techniques. These can help you stay centered when tensions rise. Start small, even 5 minutes a day of practicing calm can make a difference in how you handle heated moments.

Remember that changing this pattern won't happen overnight. There will be times you slip up and yell back - that's normal. What matters is recognizing it, resetting, and trying again next time. Each calm response is building a new habit, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.

The fact that you're aware of this pattern and wanting to change it is already a huge step forward. Keep working at it, and don't be too hard on yourself when it's difficult.","It's great that you're recognizing the pattern of behavior in your household and wanting to make a change. One thing to consider is that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. When someone yells at you, it's natural to want to yell back, but taking a step back and not engaging can be really powerful. Instead of ignoring them entirely, you could try taking a deep breath, counting to 10, or even just saying ""I'm not going to discuss this when we're both upset, let's talk about it later."" This can help de-escalate the situation and give you time to collect your thoughts before responding. It might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your family members about how their yelling affects you, and see if you can all work together to find more constructive ways of communicating. Remember that changing your response to yelling doesn't mean you're being weak or passive, it means you're taking control of your own emotions and reactions. It's not going to be easy, but with practice and patience, you can develop new habits and learn to respond in a way that feels more positive and respectful to yourself and others.","Hey, that sounds like a tough situation, and it's great you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to change it. It's definitely possible to break free from that cycle, even if it feels ingrained.

First, you're right, ignoring them *might* be a strategy, but it's hard to do in the heat of the moment. Think of it like this: you're trying to rewire your brain's reaction. It's going to take practice and you'll slip up, and that's okay. Don't beat yourself up when you do yell back, just acknowledge it and try again next time.

A few things you could try:

*   **Pre-plan your response:** When you're calm, think about a few phrases you can use when someone starts yelling. Something neutral like ""I hear you're upset"" or ""I need a minute to process this"" can buy you time and disrupt the usual yelling match. The goal is to not engage with the content of the yelling, but acknowledge the emotion.
*   **Remove yourself:** If possible, physically leave the situation. Say something like, ""I'm getting too heated, I need to step away for a bit."" Go to another room, go for a walk, anything to break the cycle. This is a really powerful tool.
*   **Focus on your breathing:** When you feel yourself getting triggered, consciously slow down your breathing. Deep breaths can help calm your nervous system and make it easier to think rationally.
*   **Lower your voice:** This might sound counterintuitive when someone is yelling, but try lowering your voice and speaking calmly. It can be disarming and force the other person to adjust their volume too.

It's also worth considering that your dad might not even realize how his yelling impacts you. Maybe, at a calm moment (definitely not during an argument!), you could try talking to him about how it makes you feel. Frame it as ""I'm trying to communicate better, and I'd appreciate it if we could both work on not yelling.""

This won't be an overnight fix, but with consistent effort, you can definitely change your reactions and hopefully influence the dynamic in your family. Good luck!

t3_10sae8b,"Too many interests, not enough time [need advice]","I have so many skills and interests but I feel like there’s not enough time to work on any of them.I work full time and my job is pretty taxing, I usually work 9-5 but usually stay working until 5:30 sometimes 6. I wfh so thankfully theres no commute.i have a dog which takes up an hour after work to walk, feed, play with him. Since I wfh I try to finish up most of my chores during the day when I can so I dont have much to do after work. By the time I’m done it’s usually around 8, sometimes around 7. I like to be In bed by 11, this gives me 3-4 hours a day.

i have so many things I want to do in life. I love music and play two instruments and want to find time to continue playing them. I love reading and writing. I was learning French and am at an intermediate level, I really want to be fluent and even learn more languages.i love learning new things and would love to take some online courses, physics, bio, chem, philosophy, etc.

i would also love to start my own company. I feel like this would allow me to control my work and control my hours. Ik its A grind but I would be willing to do it.

clearly, I have too many goals and not enough time. i often get option paralysis and end up doing nothing but watching tv. Some days I feel so burnt out by work that I do nothing but watch tv.

Any advice on managing this would be appreciated.",One thing at a time. You can't do everything. Have priorities. Less is more. You can always learn a third language after you finish learning your second. You're not saying no to other things forever by doing the first thing now.,"I’m happy to hear of someone who devotes an hour a day to their dog. That’s an awesome use of your time. Beyond that, I agree strongly with some of the other commenters - start working on 1 thing at a time. See how it goes doing it consistently for, say, 6 months. At that point, you can do it more or less and/or add a new thing to try and do consistently. 

Also stick with the things you’re already doing if you like them, or scale back on those to make more time for yourself if you feel you could better invest your time elsewhere","It sounds like you have a lot of passions, which is awesome, but it can definitely feel overwhelming. One approach is to prioritize and rotate your interests. Start by picking one or two things to focus on each week. For example, dedicate one week to music and reading, and the next to language learning and writing. This way, you’re not trying to do everything at once, and you can give each interest the attention it deserves. 

Also, consider setting small, achievable goals for each interest. Instead of aiming to become fluent in French immediately, set a goal to practice for 15 minutes a day. This makes it more manageable and less daunting. 

Lastly, try to schedule your time. If you have 3-4 hours in the evening, allocate specific time slots for your activities. This can help prevent option paralysis and ensure you’re making progress. Remember, it’s okay to have downtime too—balance is key. Good luck!","Your situation is really common - having lots of interests is great, but it can definitely lead to decision paralysis. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:

First, accept that you can't do everything at once. Instead of trying to juggle all your interests simultaneously, try breaking your year into quarters and focusing deeply on just 1-2 interests per quarter. For example, Q1 could be French + music, Q2 could be online courses, etc. This way you're still pursuing everything, just not all at the same time.

For those 3-4 free hours you have, try time blocking. Set specific days for specific activities - maybe Monday/Wednesday for French, Tuesday/Thursday for music, etc. Having a schedule eliminates the daily ""what should I do?"" decision that often leads to defaulting to TV.

For the work burnout issue - consider taking a proper break right after work instead of jumping straight into activities. A 30-minute reset (meditation, quick walk, whatever works for you) can help transition your brain from work mode to personal time.

Regarding the business idea - that's actually something you could start preparing for gradually. Use one of your quarterly blocks to research and plan. You don't need to quit your job immediately to start laying the groundwork.

Remember that consistency beats intensity. Even 30 minutes of focused practice on something is better than an irregular schedule of longer sessions. Start small, stick to your schedule, and adjust as needed.","It sounds like you've got a lot of passions and interests, but not enough hours in the day to pursue them all. First, let's give you credit for already being pretty efficient with your time - working from home, fitting in chores during the day, and prioritizing time with your dog is no small feat. 

One strategy that might help is to try to group similar activities together and allocate specific times for them. For example, you could dedicate one evening a week to music practice, another to language learning, and so on. This can help you make progress on multiple fronts without feeling overwhelmed.

Another approach is to focus on the 80/20 rule - what are the 20% of activities that will give you 80% of the fulfillment and joy? Identify your top priorities and allocate your limited time to those first. It's not about giving up on all your other interests, but about being realistic about what you can fit in.

It might also be helpful to start small - instead of trying to launch your own company or become fluent in French overnight, break down these big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make them feel less daunting and allow you to make progress without burning out.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the TV time - everyone needs downtime, and it's okay to take a break and recharge. The key is to find a balance that works for you, and to be intentional about how you're spending your free time. Remember, it's not about having more time, but about making the most of the time you have.","Hey, I totally get the feeling of having too many interests and not enough time! It's a common problem. Here's my take:

First, recognize that you can't do everything at once, and that's okay. Trying to juggle it all leads to burnout and that ""option paralysis"" you mentioned.

Instead of trying to tackle everything, try timeboxing. Allocate specific blocks of time to specific activities. Even 30 minutes of French a day is better than nothing and will keep you moving forward. Schedule it like you would a meeting.

For the startup idea, break it down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of ""start a company,"" think ""research one potential business idea for 30 minutes this week."" Small wins build momentum.

Also, be realistic about your energy levels. If you're fried after work, don't beat yourself up for needing to unwind. Maybe save the more mentally demanding tasks for weekends or mornings if that works better for you.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Progress, not perfection, is the key. Good luck!

t3_picp3q,[Need Advice] I cut off a big chunk of social media from my life. I still feel stuck.,"I haven't scrolled through insta from the past 15+ days. ( changed the password to some random generated password)

I used facebook (after a really long time) only 2 days back to reply to all the birthday wishes.

I put a limit on my reddit and youtube usage using an app - 5 minutes per hour (althought rn I am writing this from my laptop)

I don't have any friends, so I am barely using any whatsapp except to check on important messages from college.

Despite cutting off this big amount of social media from my life, I still feel stuck. I realized that I have been sleeping A LOT ever since I started on this purge.

I feel very aimless.

I also tend to check my phone even more for any updates because I have turned all the notifications off. I have unfollowed all people who are constantly posting content.

My college began on 1st sept and I got work, but I don't even feel like working on it. I don't feel motivated enough to wake up to my alarm on weekends (even after enough hours of sleep).

I workout almost every day, but once I am back home from the gym, I go back into this slow, dull, unmotivated life. My food habits haven't been great from the past few days.

I want to fix this. Help me.","It almost sounds like some kind of social media withdrawal — we become so familiar with it filling our minds and entertaining us, and now we almost have to learn to be comfortable being alone with our non-distracted selves again. 

I found I was feeling anxious without it “keeping me company” at first, but just accept that and trust that you’ll recalibrate.

I found listening to audiobooks and going for walks/spending time outside really helped me adjust after reducing social media","A common phrase I hear when it comes to social media detoxing is “It’s not enough to just remove social media from your life. You actually have to replace it with something else.” 

And that kinda makes sense. You used to get your dopamine highs from something. And now you stopped it without replacing it.

I wouldn’t recommend going cold turkey though. Honestly, I think it’s better to slowly wean yourself off it while spending more and more time doing a hobby or something else you’re interested in.","Hey there! First off, kudos for taking the big step to cut down on social media. That's not easy, and it's a great start. Feeling stuck after making such changes is pretty common, so you're not alone in this.

It sounds like you're in a bit of a transition phase, and that's okay. Here are a few things you might try to help get unstuck:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something small each day that you can accomplish. It could be as simple as reading a chapter of a book, organizing your desk, or cooking a meal. These small wins can build momentum.

2. **Create a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and help you feel more in control. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and schedule time for activities you enjoy or want to explore.

3. **Explore New Interests**: Since you've freed up some time, maybe try picking up a new hobby or skill. It could be anything from learning a new language, trying out a new sport, or even volunteering. This can add some excitement and purpose to your days.

4. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on what you're grateful for or what went well. This can shift your focus from feeling aimless to recognizing progress and positivity.

5. **Stay Connected**: Even if you don't have many friends, try to engage with people in your college or community. Joining clubs or study groups can be a great way to meet new people and feel more connected.

Remember, it's okay to have off days. Be patient with yourself and keep experimenting with what works for you. You've already shown discipline by cutting down on social media, so you definitely have it in you to make more positive changes. Keep going!","Great job on taking steps to reduce social media - that's a huge accomplishment! But you've discovered something important: removing distractions is only part of the equation. The other part is building something meaningful to fill that space.

The aimlessness you're feeling is pretty common when making big changes. Your brain is used to getting constant stimulation and dopamine hits from social media, so it's natural to feel a bit lost without them. The excessive sleeping and phone checking are your mind's way of trying to fill that void.

Here's what you can do to move forward:

First, create a simple morning routine that gives your day structure. Start with just 3 things you'll do right after waking up - maybe it's making your bed, drinking water, and reading for 10 minutes. The key is consistency, not complexity.

Since you're already working out (which is awesome), use that momentum. Right after your workout when you still have some energy, pick ONE small productive task to complete. Could be reading one chapter for college, organizing your notes, or working on an assignment for 25 minutes. Just one thing.

For the weekend alarms - give yourself a reason to wake up. Plan something enjoyable for Saturday morning, even if it's just having your favorite breakfast or going for a walk somewhere nice. Make it worth getting up for.

The goal isn't to fill every moment with productivity. It's about creating enough structure and purpose that you don't feel adrift. Start small, be consistent, and gradually build from there. You've already shown you can make positive changes - now it's just about redirecting that energy into building rather than just removing.","It's great that you've taken significant steps to reduce your social media usage, and now you're facing a new challenge - finding purpose and motivation outside of it. Cutting off social media can create a void, and it's common to feel aimless or stuck. 

One potential issue is that you've removed a big part of your daily routine without replacing it with something else. Since you've been sleeping a lot, it might be worth exploring other activities to fill your time, like reading, learning a new skill, or pursuing a hobby. You've already got a good workout habit going, which is excellent, so maybe try to build on that by setting small, achievable goals for after your gym sessions.

It's also interesting that you mention not feeling motivated enough to work on your college tasks or wake up to your alarm on weekends. Have you considered setting clear, specific goals for what you want to accomplish in a day or week? Breaking down larger tasks into smaller ones can make them feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum.

Lastly, since you've mentioned your food habits haven't been great lately, maybe try to establish a healthier routine around meal times. Sometimes, small changes like eating nutritious food or having a consistent sleep schedule can have a significant impact on our energy levels and motivation.

Remember, it's okay to take time to figure things out, and it's great that you're recognizing the need for change. Keep experimenting, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. What do you think might be a small, manageable step you could take this week to start building some momentum?","Hey, it sounds like you've made some really positive first steps by cutting back on social media. It's totally normal to feel a bit lost and aimless when you remove something that used to take up a lot of your time and attention.

It seems like you're experiencing a void, and your brain is looking for something to fill it. The increased sleep and phone checking are likely symptoms of that. Instead of just cutting things *out*, try focusing on adding things *in*.

Since you're already working out, that's a great foundation. Maybe you could build on that by setting some specific fitness goals, like learning a new skill at the gym or training for a fun run.

For the aimlessness, try exploring some new hobbies or revisiting old ones you enjoyed. Even small things like reading a book, learning to cook a new dish, or spending time in nature can make a difference. Think about what genuinely interests you, not just what you think you *should* be doing.

Regarding your college work, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the whole project, focus on completing one small step each day. The momentum from small wins can often lead to bigger motivation.

Finally, be patient with yourself. Building new habits and finding your direction takes time. Don't get discouraged if you slip up or have a bad day. Just keep making small, consistent efforts, and you'll eventually start to see progress. Good luck!

t3_r33noq,[NEED ADVICE] Issue regarding sleep and motivation to work (will be discussing porn and porn usage),"For the past two years, I have been sleeping, dreaming about me being a sissy and pleasuring different people I have met and am friends with. I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.

The worst thing about this addiction is that I don’t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked. Whenever I think about being the dude in sex, I stay up all night. But the moment I think about me getting plowed by a dick, I sleep like a baby.

This thinking is severely affecting my career. Me, doing a master’s in finance, have to give a lot of presentations. Since watching sissy porn, my confidence has dropped a lot, and I am shy all the time. My manhood is being affected by this type of porn.

I am unable to be the focus on my studies as well. I am so attracted to this type of porn that I have started missing my online lectures, or I watch porn during the lectures on my phone.

I don’t know how to cope up with this addiction. Can anyone help me spiral out of this hypnotic porn?","Seek.

Professional.

Help.

No one here can help you.","There is honesty nothing wrong with the fantasies you are having. What’s not normal is that your fantasies are intruding into your daily life. 

You need to take a break from porn but continue to enjoy your fantasies. Do not be ashamed of them. We cant control the experiences that bring us to these fantasies but its important that we accept them for what they are - enjoyable fantasies. 

Your manhood is not deteriorating because of your fantasies. Its deteriorating because you can’t accept yourself and the lack of confidence shows.

A sex therapist would the best place to help you.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation, but it's great that you're reaching out for help. Here are a few steps you might consider to start regaining control:

1. **Awareness and Acceptance**: Recognize that this is an addiction and it's affecting your life. Accepting this is the first step towards change.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Decide what you want to achieve, like improving your sleep or focusing better on your studies. Write these goals down and keep them visible.

3. **Limit Exposure**: Try to gradually reduce the time you spend watching porn. You could use website blockers or apps that limit your access to certain sites during study hours.

4. **Replace the Habit**: Find alternative activities that can fill the time you usually spend watching porn. This could be exercise, reading, or picking up a new hobby.

5. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group. Sometimes having someone to talk to can make a big difference.

6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Practice mindfulness or meditation to help manage stress and improve your sleep. Apps like Headspace or Calm can be a good start.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!","Hey there - this is clearly having a significant impact on your life, and it's good that you're reaching out for help. Porn addiction is a real issue that can affect many aspects of life, including sleep, focus, and self-image. 

The first step is to recognize that this has become a compulsive behavior that's interfering with your studies and mental wellbeing. You'll want to break this cycle through a combination of practical changes and support.

Start by installing solid website blockers on all your devices - I recommend Cold Turkey or Freedom. Block access to all porn sites and related content. Delete saved links and clear your browsing history to remove easy access points.

For the sleep issues, you'll need to establish a new bedtime routine. Put your phone in another room. Try meditation apps, reading, or listening to sleep stories instead. It may be tough at first, but your brain needs to relearn how to sleep without the current associations.

For your studies, set up your workspace in public areas like the library where you can't access inappropriate content. Use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minute breaks. This helps rebuild concentration gradually.

Most importantly, you don't have to tackle this alone. Consider joining r/pornfree for community support. There are also counselors who specialize in porn addiction and can help you work through the underlying issues. Many universities offer free counseling services - take advantage of that.

Remember that your worth isn't defined by this struggle. Focus on small daily improvements rather than trying to change everything at once. You've already taken the crucial first step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help.","It sounds like you're struggling with a pretty complex issue that's affecting multiple areas of your life. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share something like this, so kudos to you for being honest about what you're going through.

To start addressing this, I'd recommend taking a two-pronged approach: tackling the sleep issue and working on building your confidence and motivation. For sleep, you might want to try establishing a consistent bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn or erotic thoughts. This could be as simple as reading a book, meditating, or doing some light exercise before bed.

Regarding the porn addiction, it might be helpful to identify triggers that lead you to watch sissy porn and find alternative ways to cope with stress or boredom. You could try replacing porn with other activities that bring you joy or help you relax, like hobbies or spending time with friends.

It's also important to address the underlying confidence issues that are affecting your studies and presentations. Consider seeking out resources on building self-confidence, such as books, TED talks, or even therapy sessions. Additionally, you might want to try practicing positive self-talk and reframing negative thoughts about yourself.

Lastly, since you're a master's student in finance, you might find it helpful to break down your study goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help you stay focused and motivated, even when you're struggling with distractions like porn.

Remember that overcoming addiction and building discipline is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be afraid to seek out support from friends, family, or professionals if you need it. You got this, and you can spiral out of this hypnotic porn cycle with the right mindset and strategies.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out is a really positive first step. It's definitely possible to break free from this cycle.

First, acknowledge that you're dealing with a real addiction. Like any addiction, porn use can rewire your brain and create strong cravings. Don't beat yourself up about it, but recognize it's something you need to actively address.

Practical steps you can take:

1.  **Blockers:** Install website blockers on your phone and computer. There are many options out there, some even let you set a password that only someone else knows, adding an extra layer of accountability.
2.  **Replace the Habit:** When you feel the urge to watch porn, immediately do something else. This could be exercise, meditation, reading, calling a friend, or working on your studies. The key is to interrupt the thought pattern.
3.  **Scheduled Study Time:** Treat your online lectures like in-person classes. Find a quiet place, turn off your phone (or put it in another room), and focus solely on the lecture. Break down your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks with short breaks in between. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break) can be really helpful.
4.  **Address the Underlying Issues:** You mentioned a drop in confidence. Consider exploring why you feel this way. Journaling can be a good way to process your thoughts and feelings. If possible, talking to a therapist or counselor could provide valuable support and guidance.
5.  **Sleep Hygiene:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve porn. This could include reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
6.  **Accountability:** Tell a trusted friend or family member about your struggle and ask for their support. Having someone to talk to and hold you accountable can make a big difference.

It's going to take time and effort, and you'll likely have setbacks. Don't let those setbacks derail you. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track. You've got this!

t3_14eo6ut,[need advice] my shameful secret: I never went to high school.,"Bullet points so you don’t have to read the whole thing:

-I was homeschooled and my parents didn’t hold me accountable with my schoolwork 

-I think I made it to 6th or 7th grade until I stopped school completely

-I want to go to college spring 2024, but I don’t know where to start
————

I’m not sure if I’m even in the right subreddit for this but I’m kind of desperate and genuinely just truly embarrassed at this point. I’m 24 y/o and never went through high school.

I grew up in a Christian homeschooled household and to make a very long story short, since middle school my parents never kept me accountable with my school work. I believe I had some learning disabilities that made it hard for me to do my schoolwork which led me putting it off. That coupled with my parents never checking up on how I was doing/if I was completing my schoolwork, my education just slipped through the cracks. I started working and moved out when I was 17. And that’s how it’s been till now. I honestly don’t remember what grade I got to in school before I dropped out, I’m assuming 6th or 7th. 

Now that I’m nearing my mid twenties I’m realizing I’d like to go to college in spring of 2024 but I have no idea where to even start. I was hoping I could get some advice on first steps. 

I know I need to get GED but where do I go for that? Is there a program for people like me? Am I too far gone? Please help.",Hit up your local community college and tell an entrance counselor you need to take some assessment tests due to non-traditional schooling.  I guarantee you they’ve heard this story before and they will help you figure out what remedial courses are necessary.  Also ask how to get assessed for learning disabilities so you can get accommodations as necessary.,"Yo homie I also didn't get past 7th grade, I got my GED at 30, then started college 2 years after that. I'm an engineer now. It's possible for you as well, learn about passing the GED as an exam instead of trying to learn what's on it (the big books the give you are intimidating), being in college is rewarding as you are around people motivated to learn. Community college will be a better resource at first until you are ready to transfer to a university.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're taking this step towards your education—it's never too late to start. Getting your GED is a solid first move. You can find GED prep classes at local community colleges or adult education centers, and there are plenty of online resources too. Websites like GED.com can guide you to official practice tests and study materials. Once you feel ready, you can schedule your test through the same site. 

As for college, many community colleges have programs specifically designed for adult learners and those returning to education. They often offer support services to help you transition smoothly. It might be worth reaching out to a few to see what they offer. 

Building discipline will be key, so try setting small, manageable goals for your study routine. Consistency is more important than intensity at first. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and there are resources and people ready to help you succeed. Good luck!","You're absolutely not too far gone - many people have been in similar situations and successfully gotten their education back on track. The good news is that you've already taken the hardest step by deciding to make a change.

For your GED, start by checking your state's official GED testing website (just Google ""[your state] GED testing""). Most areas offer free or low-cost GED prep classes through community colleges or adult education centers. These programs are specifically designed for people in situations like yours.

Your local library is also a great resource - they often know about local GED programs and might offer free study materials. Many community colleges have ""Adult Basic Education"" departments that can help you create a study plan and prepare for the test.

Once you have your GED, community college is an excellent path to a four-year degree. They're used to working with non-traditional students and often have extra support services. Plus, starting at a community college can save you money on your first two years of college credits.

Take it one step at a time - first focus on getting your GED, then worry about college applications. Set aside specific study times each day, even if it's just an hour. Small, consistent efforts add up quickly.

Remember that your past doesn't define your future. You recognized something you want to change and you're taking action - that shows real maturity and self-awareness. Those qualities will serve you well in your educational journey.","Don't be embarrassed about your situation - it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the challenges you're facing and want to make a change. First, let's break down the steps you can take to get back on track. Getting your GED is a great starting point, and you can start by visiting the official GED website to find testing centers and study materials in your area. Many community colleges also offer GED prep classes, which might be a good resource for you.

In terms of college, many institutions have programs specifically designed for non-traditional students or those who didn't complete high school. You might want to look into colleges that offer adult education or bridge programs, which can help you transition into higher education. It's also worth reaching out to the admissions offices of colleges you're interested in to ask about their requirements and support services for students with non-traditional educational backgrounds.

Remember, it's never too late to start working towards your goals, and there are many people who have successfully gone back to school in their 20s or even later. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging what you want to achieve, so now it's just a matter of taking it one step at a time. Keep in mind that you may also be eligible for financial aid or scholarships, so be sure to explore those options as well. Good luck on your journey, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.","Hey, it's definitely not too late, and you're in the right place! Plenty of people find themselves in similar situations and successfully turn things around. Spring 2024 is totally achievable.

First, breathe. You've already taken the biggest step by recognizing what you want and reaching out.

Okay, practical steps: GED is definitely the way to go. Start by Googling ""GED prep classes near me"" or ""[your city/county] adult education."" Community colleges often have GED programs, and they're usually very affordable, sometimes even free. These programs will help you brush up on the subjects and give you practice tests.

Don't worry about what grade you ""officially"" finished. The GED covers the core high school subjects. The prep classes will assess your current level and help you focus on what you need to learn.

As for discipline, try breaking down the GED prep into small, manageable chunks. Maybe commit to studying for 30 minutes, 3 times a week to start. Use a timer and reward yourself with something small after each session. Consistency is key.

Also, look into resources for learning disabilities. Even if you were never officially diagnosed, understanding how you learn best can make a huge difference. Many adult education centers offer learning assessments and support services.

You got this! It's going to take effort, but you're clearly motivated, and that's half the battle. Good luck!

t3_seibjv,[Need Advice] how can I find self worth and stop looking for validation in others?,"I’m kind of emotionally drained, so I’m sorry if this is pretty negative. 

I grew up in an abusive house and I am currently M29. I have a hard time dealing with stress, and it is heavily affecting my work life. Since elementary school, I have been very depressed and I guess my defense at that time was to give up and shut down. Now that I’m an adult that just can’t work anymore. I have trouble holding down a job because when something tough hope s, I get so stressed out and I shut down. It’s not only mental but also physical. I’ve gotten really sick when thinking about going to work or if something stressful happens at work and my Systolic BP went dangerously high. 

It affects my self worth, and confidence. I have a very hard time supporting myself, and my wife struggles a lot to financially support me when I get fired or quit. I’ve been hospitalized over psychosis from breaking from stress. But the worst part is that I know the jobs I do would be mild-mid stress level for most people but it just overwhelms me . I’ve been trying different antidepressants and anxiolytic medicines, and still attend therapy, but it doesn’t help me enough to function more than a year (if that) in a “real job”



And another thing I would love some direction in is validation seeking. I have such low self image and self worth that I’m always seeking validation from others. I try to show off stupid things that I admit are somewhat impressive the first time but I can’t help but keep prompting validation from others. Due to my mental health issues, I have lost contact with a lot of friends as I reclused myself. And now I’m so desperate for human interaction that people I meet can feel it I think. I feel like my desperation drives people away, which fuels my desperation. 


Can someone here please help a wayward soul find some resolution?","I am sorry to hear that you’re dealing with such difficulties. Dealing with anxiety and depression is a real bitch. Like you, I have dealt with anxiety and depression for a majority of my life. I have spent thousands of hours in therapy, tried different medications, treatment methods, all with varying results but the one constant in my life seems to be the depression and anxiety. 

Not unlike you, I grew up in an unstable environment, I never really felt comfortable or safe at home, school or anywhere really. I was constantly on edge, almost always in fight-or-flight mode. I constantly worried about what in my environment might hurt me and looked for ways I could find refuge or relief. I internalized all of these feelings and as I grew up I continued to deal with it on my own by withdrawing into myself and shutting down when things got overwhelming. 

I believe the self-doubt, insecurity, anxiety, and depression are the result of my experiences growing up and how I chose to deal with them, along with a sprinkling of genetic predisposition, of course :)

Fast-forward to today, not much has changed in how I deal with my experiences and feelings. That’s where the problem lies. I continue to work with a therapist and try different treatment methods, but it continues to be a long and difficult journey. Changing habits that have been engrained in your brain over many years, habits used to protect yourself (often successfully) from the outside world, is a complicated and arduous process. It is certainly doable, but it will not be easy. 

I have made notable progress with my mental health in the past couple of years but recently I have been struggling so forgive me for the length of this comment; writing this feels therapeutic for me. Although I do not have an exact answer for you on where to get started or how to make an immediate impact on your mental health, I can spout off a few thoughts that have helped on my journey:

If nothing else, It is important to always keep in mind that the journey to the promised land of mental well-being is not a linear progression, there will be many ups and downs. Keep going through difficulties. 

While it is important to persevere through difficult times, it is equally important to recognize when something is not working for you. Knowing when it is the right time to change course and try something new is a difficult question to answer, especially when you’re already full of self-doubt, but only you can decide to keep trying. 

That said, it is immensely helpful to have someone that you can talk to and to hold you accountable, be it a therapist, partner, family member, or friend. Find someone that you can trust, to be open and honest with so that you can honestly discuss your problems and get help when you need it. 

Strive to be radically honest with yourself and with others. You will not change unless you are honest with yourself about what needs to change. This goes for dealing with your therapist or someone who is helping and holding you accountable: they cannot help unless you are being honest, even when it hurts. 

I hope this helps. I feel better for writing my thoughts out. Thank you for sharing yours.","Ohhh cured, thanks!","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Building self-worth and reducing the need for external validation is a journey, but there are some steps you can take to start moving in the right direction.

First, try to focus on small, achievable goals that can help you build confidence over time. This could be something as simple as setting a daily routine or committing to a hobby you enjoy. These small wins can gradually help you feel more in control and less reliant on others for validation.

Mindfulness and meditation can also be powerful tools. They can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, allowing you to manage stress better and reduce the physical symptoms you're experiencing. Apps like Headspace or Calm can be a good starting point if you're new to this.

Since you're already in therapy, consider discussing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques with your therapist. CBT can be particularly effective in changing negative thought patterns and building self-esteem.

Lastly, try to reconnect with people in a low-pressure way. Maybe start with online communities or groups that share your interests. This can help you rebuild social connections without the immediate pressure of face-to-face interactions.

Remember, progress might be slow, but every step forward counts. Keep reaching out and taking care of yourself. You've got this!","Hey there. Your path to building self-worth is going to start with small, consistent wins that you can control. Since you're already in therapy and working on medication management, let's focus on practical steps you can take alongside that professional support.

Start by setting one tiny goal each day that you know you can accomplish. It could be making your bed, taking a 5-minute walk, or doing one push-up. The key is that it needs to be so small that it feels almost impossible to fail. When you complete it, acknowledge it internally: ""I said I would do this, and I did it."" This builds trust with yourself.

For the validation seeking, try this: Each time you accomplish one of these small goals, write it down in a journal or notes app. This creates a record of your wins that you can look back on when you're doubting yourself. Over time, this personal record becomes more meaningful than external validation.

Regarding work stress, consider exploring remote work or freelancing options that let you control your environment and pace. Many people find this helps manage stress levels better than traditional workplace settings. Start small here too - maybe just an hour or two of focused work, then gradually build up your tolerance.

Remember that building self-worth is like building muscle - it happens gradually through consistent small efforts, not overnight. Focus on what you can control today, and let each small win stack up over time.","It takes a lot of courage to share your story and acknowledge the struggles you're facing, so thank you for being honest about your experiences. It's clear that you've been through a tremendous amount of pain and trauma, and it's understandable that you're struggling with self-worth and validation seeking.

One thing that might be helpful is to start small in building your self-worth. Instead of looking for external validation, try to focus on tiny accomplishments that you can acknowledge and celebrate yourself. This could be something as simple as making your bed, taking a shower, or cooking a meal. By recognizing and appreciating these small wins, you can start to build a sense of self-efficacy and confidence.

It's also important to recognize that your worth and identity aren't defined by your job or your ability to work. You are more than your productivity or career, and it's okay to take time to focus on your mental health and well-being. Have you considered exploring alternative forms of work or activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, but might not be as stressful or demanding?

In terms of validation seeking, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge negative self-talk. When you feel the urge to seek validation from others, try to pause and ask yourself what you're really looking for. Is it genuine connection and understanding, or is it a temporary fix to boost your self-esteem? By being more mindful of your motivations and needs, you can start to develop healthier relationships with others and work on building a more stable sense of self-worth.

Lastly, don't underestimate the importance of therapy and support groups in your journey. It's great that you're already attending therapy, and it might be helpful to explore additional resources or communities that can provide you with connection and understanding. Remember that you don't have to face this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

Keep in mind that healing and growth are slow processes, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by sharing your story and seeking help, so be proud of yourself for that.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to reach out like this. It's understandable that you're feeling drained.

First off, it's great that you're already in therapy and trying different medications. That's a solid foundation. Maybe it's worth discussing with your therapist if there are specific therapeutic techniques, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), that could help you manage stress and regulate your emotions in the moment. DBT, in particular, is often helpful for people who have difficulty managing intense emotions.

Regarding the job situation, instead of aiming for ""real jobs"" right away, could you explore part-time or freelance work that allows you to gradually build your tolerance to stress? Maybe something project-based where you have more control over your workload and deadlines. This could help you build confidence and a sense of accomplishment without immediately overwhelming you. Even volunteering could be a good way to ease back into a work environment and build skills.

As for the validation seeking, that's a tough cycle to break. One thing that might help is to actively work on building your self-worth from the inside out. Start small. Maybe each day, write down one thing you appreciate about yourself, even if it feels silly at first. Focus on your strengths and accomplishments, no matter how small they seem. Another thing you can try is to set small, achievable goals for yourself each day. Completing these goals can give you a sense of accomplishment and boost your self-esteem.

To combat the loneliness, instead of focusing on making new friends right away, maybe reconnect with some of the old ones, even if it's just a quick message or a phone call. Start small and build from there. You could also explore joining groups or activities based on your interests. This can help you meet people who share your passions and build connections organically.

It's a process, and there will be setbacks, but be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help. Keep going!

t3_q4vio6,"[Need advice] I’m so lost, I don’t even know if I want help anymore I just want nothing","I can’t do this anymore but I don’t want to be dead because I’m too well fed what do I do what do I do to take myself out of this hell hole 

I feel like an indescribably idiotic snot blowing shit that knows and does fuck all

I’m destined for the long decline 

I don’t have any more responses or words I just want to feel tame in my character and feel like I’m actually worth a shit and can help people

When I talk to my friend I feel like shit because he’s so much more mature and articulate snd everything more than I am

I can never form proper sentences because I never tried and I’m a proper moron 

I will never achieve, he is knowledgeable in the world, I am knowledgeable in the specks under park benches 

I know nothing of the world, I’ve been taken care of 

I want to be dead but I’m too scared of everything and I feel woeful like this is forever and it’s my fault and it’s my fault forever my mind is so limited in scope I hate my mind","A person i know, used to word as a cleaner in a court, 57 years old, dropped school at 6th grade
He was once disrespected by one of the workers in the court, you could imagine wha could this old man do to himself if he thought the way you did while writing this post. 



Do you know what he did instead?
He silently spent the next 8 years, back to school, finished it, started university, and became a lawyer, done?
No , he continued until he became a judge
I know him personally and he is an alive example of the truth of human potential 
Be this guy cause you can 
Don’t rush things up it will take time","1) never compare yourself with anyone. You dont know anything about your friend. Maybe he is lucky and went to a private middle school or maybe their parents made him read books, or idk... a lot of variables can happen here that you cant just compare because you cant just keep up with someone who already put in the work. It is like me trying to compare to an olympic medallist who works out 30hrs/ week at the gym, and Im jealous because I dont have a six pack like him. I cannot keep up with 30hrs/week workouts. 

2) Understand that yeah you suck on many things, BUT you are good on something. Look at where you are good at, and keep polishing those skills. Believe me! You can become a beast on something that you already have some talent or you just like it a lot. Hard work will always beat ANYTHING. 

3) Enjoy the small things. Get up and say man, Im alive. I can breathe. Im thankful for that. There is a lot of people dying right now cause of covid who cannot even breath properly man. Thats f*cked up. We can breath. We can walk. We can bake. Be grateful for that! 

4) most of us are all here for you and anyone. Some of us will be happy to give advices. You are not alone.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to say that it's okay to feel lost and overwhelmed. You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. 

First, try to take a step back and breathe. It's easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others, but remember that everyone is on their own journey. Your friend might seem more mature or knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean you can't grow and learn too. 

Start small. Pick one thing you want to improve or learn about and dedicate a little time each day to it. It could be reading a book, listening to a podcast, or even just observing the world around you. The key is consistency, not perfection. 

Also, consider writing down your thoughts. It might help you articulate your feelings better and give you a clearer picture of what you want to change. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Progress takes time, and every small step counts. You're worth it, and you have the potential to make a positive impact on yourself and others. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.","Hey there. First things first - if you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to someone who can help right now. There's always someone ready to listen at 988 (US) or your country's suicide prevention hotline.

It sounds like you're caught in a really tough comparison trap with your friend. Here's the thing - everyone develops at their own pace, and comparing yourself to others only holds you back from your own growth. Your friend didn't start out articulate and knowledgeable - they built those skills over time, just like you can.

Start small. Pick one area you want to improve in. Maybe it's reading one news article a day to learn about the world. Maybe it's practicing speaking by recording yourself talking about topics you care about. The key is consistency, not perfection.

Your worth isn't measured by how well you can articulate yourself or how much worldly knowledge you have. But if you want to grow in these areas, you absolutely can. Your brain is capable of learning and changing throughout your entire life.

Take one tiny step today. Just one. Read one article. Write one paragraph. Have one conversation about something new. Then do it again tomorrow. Over time, these small actions add up to real change.

You're not stuck where you are unless you choose to be. Your past doesn't have to define your future. But you need to be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.","It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and stuck right now. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, and the fact that you're reaching out for help is a huge step. It might not feel like it, but it's a sign that you haven't given up yet. 

When you say you want to ""feel tame in your character"" and be worth something, it sounds like you're craving a sense of purpose and self-improvement. That's a great place to start. Instead of focusing on all the things you feel like you're not good at, try to identify one small thing that you'd like to work on or achieve. It could be as simple as reading a book, taking a short walk each day, or practicing a new skill. Having a tiny goal to work towards can help build momentum and confidence.

It's also important to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and nobody is born with all the knowledge and skills they need. Your friend might seem more mature and articulate, but that doesn't mean you can't develop those qualities too. It's okay to learn from others and ask for help - it doesn't make you any less worthy.

Lastly, please know that there are people who care about you and want to support you through this tough time. If you're feeling like you're in crisis or having thoughts of self-harm, there are resources available to help. You can reach out to a crisis hotline, talk to a trusted friend or family member, or seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. You don't have to face this alone.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot right now. It's brave of you to reach out.

First off, it's okay to feel lost and overwhelmed. A lot of people feel that way at some point. The important thing is to take small steps forward. You mentioned wanting to feel like you're worth something and can help people. That's a great starting point.

Maybe try volunteering somewhere. Even something small, like helping out at a local animal shelter or food bank, can make a difference and give you a sense of purpose. It can also get you out of your head and into the world.

As for feeling inadequate compared to your friend, remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of comparing yourself, try to learn from him. Ask him how he developed his knowledge and communication skills. Maybe he can recommend some books or resources.

Building discipline is about small, consistent actions. Start with one thing you want to improve, like your communication skills. Maybe try writing in a journal every day, even if it's just a few sentences. Or read a book and try to summarize each chapter.

Don't try to change everything at once. Focus on one small step at a time, and celebrate your progress along the way. It's a journey, not a race. And remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help.

t3_uiyesu,[need advice] on how to get unstuck,"I apologize if someone asked this already, but I've been demotivated and stuck lately. 
I have so many things to do and only thinking about it makes me feel paralysed. I wanna take action but I really can't. 
When something similar happened in the past I used to waste time watching motivational videos on YouTube, now I can't even find the will to do so (I mean, this is not entirely bad). 
I just don't want to do anything at all but at the same time I want to do what I have to/like to do. 
I don't know if it has to do with perfectionism or my low self esteem in general: I sometimes feel like I'm the dumbest person in the world, everything I do comes out pretty bad, or if I'm studying I just feel like I can't really understand. I don't always feel this way, but anytime I do something I'm proud of, it doesn't take longer before I realise I've been delusional about it. 
Any similar experience? Does anybody know how to get out of this?","When I find myself into a very demotivated state I tend to lean on this daily habit I have where I make a todo list of 1-5 things I want to get done.  If I am really unmotivated the list my only be 1-2 things and they are very easy todo.  If I am having a better day it might be 5 things and a lot more ambitious.  The idea is that no matter how small the thing is that you do you are moving your life forward.  This helps a lot because the biggest motivator is seeing results.

What can go hand in hand with this is breaking down your goals into the smallest possible steps.  When your break down your goals to very small steps then all you need to do is look at the step right in front of you and take it.  Once you take enough steps you will hit the finish line.","This totally makes sense. I'll try this way.
Thank you","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and it's totally okay to feel stuck sometimes. One thing that might help is breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of focusing on everything at once, pick one small thing you can do today. It could be as simple as organizing your desk or reading a single page of a book. Celebrate these small wins, no matter how minor they seem. Also, try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes to work on something. Often, just starting is the hardest part, and once you get going, you might find it easier to continue. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and take it one step at a time. You've got this!","What you're experiencing is really common - that paralysis from having too many things to do, combined with perfectionism that makes starting feel impossible. Here's what has worked for others in similar situations:

Start ridiculously small. Like, laughably small. Want to study? Commit to reading just one paragraph. Want to exercise? Do a single push-up. The key is making the barrier to entry so low that your brain can't come up with excuses.

The ""two-minute rule"" is great for this. Tell yourself you only have to work on something for two minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll naturally want to continue. But if you don't, that's fine too - you still succeeded by doing those two minutes.

For the perfectionism piece: try treating yourself like you're learning a new video game. You're supposed to be bad at first. That's normal. You're gathering experience points. Every ""failure"" is actually just useful data about what works and what doesn't.

Keep a ""done list"" instead of just a to-do list. At the end of each day, write down everything you accomplished, no matter how small. Over time, you'll see that you're making more progress than your brain wants to admit.

Remember: motivation follows action, not the other way around. You don't need to feel motivated to start. Just take one tiny step, then another. The momentum will build naturally from there.","It sounds like you're dealing with a tough mix of motivation and self-doubt issues. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your tasks into tiny, manageable chunks. This can make it feel less daunting and allow you to build momentum. For example, if you're struggling to study, start by committing to just 10-15 minutes of focused work per day. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you'll find you can keep going. Additionally, try to practice some self-compassion - remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It might also be helpful to identify what triggers your negative self-talk and see if you can challenge those thoughts with more realistic, positive ones. As for getting unstuck, sometimes taking a break and doing something completely unrelated can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective. Have you tried setting aside some time to do something you enjoy, just for fun, without any expectations or pressure to perform?","Hey, I've definitely been there. It sounds like you're in a classic overwhelm/avoidance cycle. The good news is, it's breakable!

First, ditch the idea of needing to do *everything*. Pick *one* tiny thing. Seriously tiny. Like, ""open the document I need to work on"" tiny. Or ""read one page of the textbook."" The goal isn't to accomplish something huge, it's to break the inertia.

Second, be kind to yourself. The negative self-talk is a killer. When you catch yourself thinking ""I'm the dumbest person,"" try to counter it with something neutral, like ""I'm learning."" It feels silly, but it helps rewire your brain over time.

Third, forget perfection. Aim for ""done,"" not ""perfect."" Perfectionism is often just procrastination in disguise. If you're studying, try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break). It helps make the task less daunting.

Finally, remember that progress isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days. Don't beat yourself up for the bad ones, just acknowledge them and try again tomorrow. You got this!

Read a book (start with 5 pages/day)","Hey there! It's awesome that you're looking to build some good habits. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 

1. **Morning Routine**: Start your day with a simple routine. It could be as easy as making your bed, drinking a glass of water, or doing a quick stretch. This sets a positive tone for the day.

2. **Exercise**: Even a short daily walk or a few minutes of stretching can make a big difference. It helps clear your mind and boosts your mood.

3. **Reading**: Try reading a few pages of a book each day. It can be anything you enjoy or something that helps you learn and grow.

4. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Spend a few minutes each day focusing on your breath or practicing mindfulness. It can help reduce stress and improve focus.

5. **Gratitude Journal**: Write down a few things you're grateful for each day. It shifts your mindset to focus on the positive.

6. **Healthy Eating**: Start with small changes, like adding a fruit or vegetable to each meal. It can improve your energy levels and overall health.

Remember, the key is to start small and be consistent. It's better to do a little bit every day than to try to change everything at once. Good luck, and you've got this! 💪","Hey there! Here are some solid habits you can start building to replace those addictive patterns:

Start your day with a 5-minute meditation or deep breathing exercise. This helps set a calm, focused tone for the day.

Get moving - even just a 10-minute walk each morning makes a huge difference. Exercise is one of the most powerful positive habits.

Read for 15-20 minutes daily, whether it's a book, article, or anything that interests you. This can replace mindless scrolling.

Practice the ""2-minute rule"" - if something takes less than 2 minutes (making your bed, washing dishes right after eating), do it immediately.

Drink water first thing in the morning and keep a water bottle with you. Staying hydrated improves mood and energy.

Set a consistent sleep schedule. Try going to bed and waking up at the same time every day.

Start small with these - pick just 1-2 to focus on initially. The key is consistency over intensity. Track your progress in a simple journal or app to stay motivated.

Remember that building new habits takes time, usually about 66 days for them to become automatic. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small wins along the way.

What habit would you like to start with? Sometimes sharing your intention helps with accountability.","Instead of focusing on a long list of good habits, let's start with identifying one or two areas in your life where you'd like to see improvement. What are some specific bad addictive habits you're trying to break free from? Once we pinpoint those, we can work on replacing them with healthier alternatives. For example, if you're trying to quit scrolling through your phone mindlessly, you could try replacing that habit with reading or taking a short walk. Let's focus on building small, achievable habits that can help you create a stronger foundation for discipline and self-improvement. What do you say we start with one small change this week and see how it goes?","Hey! It's awesome you're looking to replace some bad habits with good ones. That's a great first step. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, maybe pick one or two small, manageable habits to start with.

For example, if you're spending too much time online, try setting a timer for 20 minutes of focused work or reading, followed by a short break. Or, if you want to be healthier, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Small wins build momentum!

Also, think about *why* you're engaging in the addictive habits. Are you bored? Stressed? Identifying the triggers can help you find healthier ways to cope. Good luck, you got this!

t3_vpyfhz,[Need Advice] Strong pull toward inaction when it comes to doing unpleasant activities.,"For example, cleaning my room or organizing. I'd legitimately rather stare blankly at the wall for an hour than get started on it. In fact I've done just that before.

I realize it will ultimately come to ""just find a way to motivate yourself to do it or form a disciplined routine around it etc etc"" which is fine. But ideally I'd like to stop my mind from having that reaction to begin with. Is there any way to eliminate the pull toward doing nothing instead of something?","Here’s the thing - it’s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that’s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.

One of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.

So here’s the tips:
1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.
2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.
3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.
4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.
5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.

Eventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",I realised recently my messy room was a coping mechanism. I found it hard to clean up because a messy room was a barrier to entry when I was younger (nothing too sinister just a method of protecting my privacy) maybe you have a similar situation. How far back is your room messy and what did your childhood self feel about the mess,"I totally get where you're coming from. Tackling unpleasant tasks can feel like a huge mental hurdle. One trick that might help is the ""5-minute rule."" Tell yourself you'll only work on the task for 5 minutes. Often, just starting is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it's easier to keep going. Also, try to pair the task with something you enjoy, like listening to your favorite music or podcast. This can make the activity feel less daunting. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset and reduce that pull toward inaction. Good luck!","That pull toward inaction is super common - your brain is trying to avoid what it perceives as unpleasant work. The good news is you can gradually rewire this response through a few practical approaches.

First, try breaking tasks into ridiculously small chunks. Instead of ""clean room,"" make it ""put away one item"" or ""clear this one corner of the desk."" Your brain has less resistance to tiny actions, and once you start, momentum often carries you further.

Second, use implementation intentions: ""When X happens, I will do Y."" For example, ""When I finish my morning coffee, I will put away 3 items."" This bypasses the decision-making process where resistance typically creeps in.

A technique that's helped many people is the ""5-4-3-2-1"" method. Count down from 5, and when you hit 1, immediately take physical action - stand up, grab that first item, whatever gets you moving. It short-circuits the overthinking that leads to inaction.

The key isn't fighting the resistance - that just creates more mental friction. Instead, make the first step so small it feels almost silly to resist it. Over time, as you build positive associations with taking action, that pull toward inaction naturally weakens.

Start with just 2 minutes of action at scheduled times. The consistency matters more than duration at first. You're essentially teaching your brain that these tasks aren't actually threatening, and the resistance will gradually fade.","I think what you're experiencing is pretty common, and it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to address it. One strategy that might help is to try to understand what's driving your aversion to these tasks - is it the physical effort, the mental overwhelm, or something else? Once you have a better sense of what's behind your resistance, you can start to break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces, and find ways to make it less painful. For example, instead of thinking ""I need to clean my entire room,"" try telling yourself ""I'll just put away these 5 items on my desk."" It's a small win, but it can get you moving. Additionally, you might consider implementing a ""2-minute rule"" - when you feel the urge to procrastinate, commit to working on the task for just 2 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and you'll find you can keep going after those initial 2 minutes are up. As for eliminating the pull toward doing nothing, it's unlikely you'll be able to completely eliminate it, but by building discipline and developing strategies to overcome your resistance, you can make it easier to choose action over inaction.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is actively fighting you! Instead of trying to eliminate the feeling entirely (which is tough), maybe try to work *with* it.

One thing that helps me is breaking tasks down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of ""clean my room,"" it's ""put one sock in the hamper."" Seriously. Just *one*. The barrier to entry is so low that it's hard to argue with. Often, once you've done that one tiny thing, you'll find it easier to do another, and another.

Another trick is to pair the unpleasant task with something you *enjoy*. Listen to your favorite podcast while you organize, or promise yourself a small treat (like a piece of chocolate or 5 minutes of browsing Reddit) after 15 minutes of cleaning.

Finally, consider *why* you're avoiding the task. Is it overwhelming? Do you not know where to start? If that's the case, maybe spend a few minutes planning *before* you start. A little bit of planning can make the task seem less daunting. Good luck!

t3_q1bfdu,[NEED ADVICE] I easily lose motivation and feel like a failure due to my undisciplined life.,"Hello everyone. I am here to share my heart with you all. Please be patient and hear me out. 
I am a 27 year old guy with a 9-7 job, 5 days a week. I lead a healthy lifestyle where I go to gym 4-5 days a week. My life seems quite satisfactory to people around me. I feel motivated too till everything around me is going smooth, but as soon as I lack somewhere in my routine like when I oversleep in the morning and arrive late at work or when I am not able to finish my day to day tasks on time, I get these anxiety attacks where I feel I have become a failure and will not be able to do much in life. 
I feel life I am not progressing at all and this thought haunts me even more when I see people my age achieving milestones while I am here struggling to keep up with my everyday life. 

I feel I lack discipline. Can you suggest me something to help me cope up with this situation?","Since I’m about 30 years older than you I would like to give you my perspective from my age. Once you get into your 40s and especially your 50s you realize that all of those milestones are not as important as they seemed in your 20s. Everybody’s life has a different path and while others may be hitting certain milestones those may not be your milestones. You’ll achieve other milestones that are important for your life. And when you reach your 40s and 50s you’ll realize that the only thing that’s really important is that you’re happy. You’ll realize that a job that you enjoy is the most important thing because living your entire career for Fridays and holidays and vacation days is a horrible way to live. And I know because I did that for 26 years. Find some thing you love that doesn’t make you dread Sunday night because you know Monday’s coming and you don’t live for days you don’t have to go to work. Find friends that are loyal and true that you can completely be yourself with, your quirky, weird side no one really gets to see. And if you’re creating a bucket list of things you’d like to do don’t wait, go do them right now. Because you don’t know what 20 or 30 years down the line in your life will look like. And I know because at 50 I became disabled. And now I cannot accomplish many of the things that were on my bucket list. I hope somehow this was helpful. But just judge your life by how you feel and not what everyone else is doing. And the things you don’t get done today, they will still be there tomorrow to finish. Be kind to yourself. And if the panic attacks continue please talk to your doctor. You don’t really realize how severe they are until you stop having them. Also try some meditation and some yoga. That probably sounds a little weird but it works and I know because I’ve tried it. And even though nobody likes to talk about it our mental health is incredibly incredibly important.",This comment was extremely helpful to me in this moment. Thank you for sharing.,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to improve. It sounds like you're already doing a lot of things right, like maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working a steady job. It's normal to feel like you're not progressing sometimes, especially when comparing yourself to others. Remember, everyone's journey is different.

One thing that might help is focusing on small, consistent habits rather than big changes. For example, if oversleeping is a problem, try setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. This can help regulate your sleep cycle. Also, consider breaking your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This way, you can celebrate small wins and build momentum.

When you feel anxious about not meeting your goals, try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of seeing it as a failure, view it as a learning opportunity. Ask yourself what you can do differently next time. Lastly, practice self-compassion. You're doing your best, and that's what matters. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!","First off, you're actually doing better than you realize. Having a stable job and consistent gym routine already shows discipline - many people struggle with just those basics. But I understand that feeling of falling short, especially when small disruptions throw you off.

Here's what might help: Instead of seeing discipline as all-or-nothing, try building in flexibility. Life rarely goes perfectly according to plan, and that's normal. When you oversleep or miss a deadline, treat it as a temporary setback rather than a complete failure. The most disciplined people aren't those who never slip up - they're the ones who get back on track quickly without spiraling.

Try setting up some ""if-then"" contingency plans. For example: ""If I oversleep, then I'll skip the morning routine but still get to work as soon as possible."" This gives you a clear path forward when things go wrong, rather than feeling paralyzed by imperfection.

As for comparing yourself to others - remember that social media and casual observations only show highlights, not daily struggles. Focus on competing with yourself from yesterday, not with carefully curated versions of other people's lives.

Consider tracking your wins, even small ones. Write down three things you accomplished each day, no matter how minor. Over time, you'll see that you're making more progress than you realize, and it'll help buffer against those moments of self-doubt.

Remember: discipline isn't about perfection - it's about consistency over time, including how you handle and bounce back from the inevitable off days.","It sounds like you're setting a really high bar for yourself and getting caught up in all-or-nothing thinking, where one slip-up makes you feel like a total failure. First, let's acknowledge that having a 9-7 job and going to the gym 4-5 times a week is already a huge accomplishment - it shows you have a good foundation of discipline in some areas of your life. 

One strategy that might help is to focus on building ""mini-habits"" - really small, achievable goals that you can consistently hit every day, like making your bed as soon as you get up or doing one push-up as soon as you wake up. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum and confidence. 

Another thing to consider is that everyone has their own pace and trajectory in life. Just because someone your age is achieving certain milestones doesn't mean you're behind or failing. It's okay to take things one step at a time and prioritize your own goals and well-being. 

Lastly, when you do have those anxiety attacks, try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's normal to have off days. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to learn from what went wrong and make a plan to get back on track the next day. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","Hey man, it sounds like you're already doing a lot of things right! Don't discount the healthy lifestyle and consistent work – that's a solid foundation. It's easy to fall into the comparison trap, especially with social media highlighting everyone's ""wins.""

Instead of viewing slip-ups as total failures, try reframing them as learning opportunities. Overslept? Okay, what can you tweak tonight to make tomorrow morning easier? Maybe set a second alarm, prep your clothes, or go to bed 15 minutes earlier.

Discipline isn't about perfection; it's about consistency over time. It's like compound interest – small, consistent efforts build up. Try focusing on one small habit at a time. Maybe it's just making your bed every morning, or spending 15 minutes planning your day. Once that feels automatic, add another.

Also, consider breaking down your bigger goals into smaller, more manageable steps. ""Progressing in life"" is huge and vague. What does that *actually* mean to you? Once you define it, you can create actionable steps and track your progress, which can help combat that feeling of stagnation. Good luck, you got this!

t3_12bny0c,[need advice] pls help. how do i stop self-ruminating by worrying every second about hypothetical possibilities?,"




i’m so sorry if this post is annoying, i just don’t know what to do. please help me. 

i think a lot. my mind is always working and it’s exhausting as fuck. 

whatever i observe in day to day life, my mind is going to contemplate on it, find a way to link it to my own life somehow, and overthink to the point of self-rumination. i cannot stop it. 

i keep making up scenarios of what could go wrong with my life and worry every second i’m alive. i cannot live in the moment, i’m always thinking about the future and the what-ifs. 

my mind finds a way to link whatever it sees to something in my life. 

saw some news that somebody slipped and died. now i’m forever worrying, whenever i’m away from my parents, if they’re okay. what if they fell? what if something happened to them?

if i see some random homicide news i’m 24*7 scared for the next few days that someone will kill my family. “my father yelled at some guy the other day, what if that guy happens to be some psycho and starts plotting out of anger??” and i cannot sleep the whole night. 

saw a show where a couple broke up after 8 years of dating, 2 months before their wedding, because one of them wanted to discover who they are outside of a relationship. what if that happens to me? what if my boyfriend breaks up with me randomly, long into our relationship, because of this? 

what if he someday randomly says he has changed his mind and wants to settle abroad and we have to break up? 

what if my dog dies of xyz accident the way i saw on the news? 

and 1273827383 other types of what-ifs. everyday i find a new thing to obsess about, worry myself SICK with my anxiety running wild and basically just make sure i’m permanently unhappy even if things are okay in my life because my bitch ass anxiety has me fixated over the things going wrong in my IMAGINATION.

i hate this, i hate myself, i feel like i’ll never be happy. please help me. i just want to be happy and want my mind to shut the fuck up.","Use David Burns' material: his books and/or his free online depression course at feelinggood.com 

The thoughts you're thinking are called ""Automatic Negative Thoughts"". Even if you're not depressed, the same methods he teaches can be used to handle these thoughts. A lot of his methods are about handling automatic negative thoughts.

You can talk back to the thoughts:

""Thank you, brain! Thank you for sharing!"" (from a video link somebody posted on this subreddit in the last few months) while smiling and then ignoring it

""What if it doesn't?""

""What about the 999,999 people that isn't going to happen to?"" (The what-if generating part of the brain doesn't tend to be impressed by logic, the word ""not"", or small probabilities, though; it's more into pictures, associations and emotions. So this kind of reasoning might not help much but it doesn't hurt.)

""There's a thought. OK. Right now is the time for sleeping. Tomorrow at 10AM I'll sit down with paper and pencil and work out whether there's any action to be taken on that."" (After a few days, if you really do sit down and work things out, even if it's to write ""no action required"", your brain tends to learn to trust that and sleep.) Keep a pad of paper beside the bed to write down a couple of words as a reminder when any concerns pop up.

Taking action on your concerns, for example suggesting to your father not to yell; learning not to yell yourself, etc. can help calm these thoughts down (I think -- or does it encourage them?)

Often when we worry, it's our subsconscious trying to distract us from our real concerns. Think about what you're really supposed to be taking action on now -- Income tax forms? Studying for a test? etc. -- and take some action every day on those things. Then the subconscious won't need to think up worries to distract you.

I find it helps to take a few minutes just before going to sleep, to meditate and clear the mind. Rather than thinking about something, by having an empty mind, it allows any deeper worries to come up and also be calmed and set aside. Otherwise, when I start to fall asleep, I stop thinking about whatever I was thinking about, and then the deeper worry steps in and wakes me up.",Thank you OP for posing the question…and footpathmaker for the great response. I suffer from ANTs too and will   tap into these recommendations,"Hey there! First off, you're definitely not annoying, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. It sounds like your mind is on overdrive, and that can be really tough. One thing that might help is practicing mindfulness. It’s about training your mind to focus on the present moment rather than getting lost in the ""what-ifs."" You can start small, like dedicating just 5 minutes a day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your breath. Over time, this can help you gain more control over your thoughts.

Another thing to try is journaling. Write down your worries and then challenge them. Ask yourself how likely these scenarios are and if there's any evidence to support them. Sometimes seeing your thoughts on paper can help you realize they’re not as overwhelming as they seem in your head.

Lastly, consider setting boundaries for consuming news or media that triggers your anxiety. It’s okay to take a break from things that make you feel worse. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to seek professional help if you need it. You're not alone in this, and you can definitely work towards a calmer mind. Take care!","Hey there - what you're describing sounds really challenging and exhausting. The good news is there are concrete techniques you can use to regain control over these racing thoughts.

First, start practicing mindfulness meditation. Even 5-10 minutes daily can help train your brain to recognize when it's spiraling into ""what-if"" scenarios. The Headspace or Calm apps are great for beginners. When anxious thoughts come up, acknowledge them without judgment and gently return focus to your breath.

Second, try the ""worry schedule"" technique. Set aside 15-20 minutes each day as designated worry time. When anxious thoughts pop up outside that window, write them down for later and redirect your attention to the present moment. This helps contain the worry rather than letting it spread throughout your day.

Third, challenge these thoughts with evidence. When you catch yourself catastrophizing, ask ""What evidence do I have that this will actually happen? What's more likely to occur?"" Write down both the worry and a more realistic alternative.

Fourth, channel this mental energy into productive action. If you're worried about loved ones, set up regular check-in routines. If you're anxious about relationships, have open conversations about future goals. Converting worry into concrete steps helps reduce that feeling of helplessness.

Remember that managing these thought patterns is a skill that can be developed with practice. If these techniques aren't providing enough relief after consistent effort, consider working with a cognitive behavioral therapist who can provide additional strategies tailored to your situation.

Start small - even tiny improvements in managing these thoughts will compound over time into significant positive changes.","It sounds like you're really struggling with anxiety and rumination, and it's taking a toll on your daily life. One thing that might help is to practice mindfulness and meditation - not to stop your thoughts completely, but to learn how to observe them without getting caught up in the cycle of worry. When you notice yourself starting to spiral into ""what-ifs,"" try to acknowledge the thought and then gently bring your focus back to the present moment. You can start with just a few minutes a day, using a guided meditation app or simply paying attention to your breath.

Another strategy is to set aside a specific ""worry time"" each day - say, 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night - where you allow yourself to think about all the things that are worrying you. But when that time is up, try to let go of those thoughts and focus on the present moment. This can help contain your worry and prevent it from bleeding into every other part of your day.

It's also important to challenge some of these catastrophic thoughts - for example, just because someone in a TV show broke up with their partner after 8 years, doesn't mean that will happen to you. Try to reframe some of these ""what-ifs"" in a more realistic and positive light. And when you're feeling overwhelmed, remind yourself that you've survived every difficult moment in your life so far, and you can keep doing it.

Lastly, consider seeking out professional help - a therapist can work with you to develop coping strategies and provide support as you work through these issues. You don't have to do this alone, and there is hope for feeling more grounded and at peace.","Hey, I really get how exhausting that constant overthinking can be. It sounds like you're stuck in a loop of anxiety, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.

One thing that might help is to start practicing mindfulness. It sounds kinda cliché, but even just a few minutes a day of focusing on your breath or your senses can help you ground yourself in the present moment instead of getting lost in ""what ifs."" There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through it.

Another thing to try is challenging those thoughts when they pop up. When you start spiraling about your parents, ask yourself, ""Is there any real evidence that they're in danger right now?"" Often, the answer is no. You can also try writing down your worries and then listing the reasons why those things are unlikely to happen. It can help to see it all laid out logically.

It also sounds like you might benefit from setting some boundaries with your thoughts. When you notice yourself ruminating, try to consciously redirect your attention to something else – a hobby, a conversation, anything that can pull you out of the spiral. It takes practice, but it can get easier over time.

Finally, and I know this is easier said than done, try to be kind to yourself. You're not a ""bitch ass"" for having anxiety; it's a real thing, and it's okay to struggle with it. If these tips don't seem to be enough, consider talking to a therapist. They can give you personalized strategies for managing your anxiety and help you break free from those thought patterns. You're not alone in this, and it's definitely possible to find some peace of mind.

t3_xt9y8l,"[Need Advice] To people who do work or activities that require immense amounts of discipline frequently , what trick did you employ to get into that flow state","I'm having difficulty turning occasional habits into daily consitent habits and was wondering what others  who were in my situation did to tackl the problem.

[Edit] Thank you to everyone who took their time and contributed to the post. I've received some very insightful advice on the techniques i can use to boost my discipline. I will make full use of them",That’s a tough one. Seems like the best thing I’ve done is to create a first step that is simply too small to fail. I want to walk? I just focus on putting on my shoes. Once I’ve done that I’m much more likely to actually continue on with the task.,I notice I’m deepest in the flow state when I use mind muscle connection in any physical sport,"One trick that really helped me was the ""two-minute rule."" Basically, if a habit takes less than two minutes to start, just do it. This helps overcome the initial resistance and makes it easier to build momentum. For example, if you want to start reading daily, just commit to reading one page. Often, you'll find that once you start, you'll want to keep going. Also, try to attach the new habit to an existing one. If you already have a morning coffee routine, use that time to do a quick meditation or plan your day. Consistency is key, so even small steps count. Good luck!","Getting into a flow state consistently comes down to creating the right environment and triggers that signal ""it's time to work."" Start small - pick one habit you want to build and create a clear pre-work ritual. This could be as simple as sitting at the same spot, putting on specific music, or doing 2-3 minutes of breathing exercises before starting.

The key is reducing friction. Set up your workspace the night before. Put everything you need within arm's reach. Remove distractions like your phone or browser notifications. Make starting so easy that it feels almost silly not to do it.

What helped me most was the ""just 5 minutes"" rule. Tell yourself you only have to work for 5 minutes. Usually once you start, momentum takes over and you'll keep going. If not, that's fine - you still built the habit. Consistency matters more than duration early on.

Track your progress with a simple habit tracker. Seeing those checkmarks build up creates a powerful motivation to maintain your streak. When you do miss a day (it happens), jump right back in the next day. Don't let one slip become a slide.

Remember that flow states aren't something you force - they emerge when you've reduced mental resistance through consistent practice. Focus first on showing up daily, even if just briefly. The flow will follow naturally as the habit strengthens.","One technique that has helped many people develop consistent habits is to start small and focus on building a chain of successes, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. For example, if you want to develop a daily writing habit, start by committing to write for just 10-15 minutes each day, and gradually increase the time as the habit becomes more ingrained. It's also important to identify your why - what motivates you to want to develop these habits in the first place? Reminding yourself of your underlying goals and values can help you stay focused and motivated, even when the going gets tough. Additionally, tracking your progress and holding yourself accountable can be a powerful tool - consider using a habit tracker or journal to monitor your progress and reflect on what's working and what areas need improvement.","Hey, I've been there! Turning occasional habits into daily ones is tough, but totally doable. One thing that helped me was focusing on *why* I wanted to build the habit in the first place. Connecting it to a bigger goal made it more meaningful.

Also, don't try to change everything at once. Pick *one* habit to focus on, and make it ridiculously easy to start. Like, if you want to read more, start with just reading one page a day. The key is consistency, even if it's a tiny amount. Once that's locked in, you can gradually increase it. Good luck, you got this!

I don’t want to stick with one hobby for the rest of my life for the sake of it. I want to enjoy what I’m doing…and most of the time that’s trying new things. 

Some books aren’t meant to be finished, some hobbies aren’t lifetime pursuits.","Have you noticed any similarities in your stopping points? Like do you stop once it starts getting harder to improve? Or do your friends do different activities, so there isn't a social reason to keep doing it","It's totally normal to explore different hobbies, especially as a teen. You're in a phase of discovering what truly interests you, and that's a good thing! One way to approach this is to set small goals for each hobby you try. For example, commit to practicing martial arts for a certain number of months or achieving a specific skill level before deciding whether to continue. This can help you build discipline and give each hobby a fair chance. Also, try to reflect on what you enjoy about each activity and what makes you lose interest. This might help you identify patterns and find hobbies that align more with your long-term interests. Remember, it's okay to change hobbies—it's all part of learning about yourself!","It's actually pretty normal to explore different interests as a teen - your brain is wired to try new things and figure out what clicks. The key is finding the balance between giving activities a fair shot and knowing when to pivot.

Before dropping martial arts or football completely, try asking yourself what initially drew you to each one. Was it the physical challenge? The social aspect? Understanding your motivations can help you stick with activities that align with your core interests.

One practical approach is to commit to any new hobby for a set period (say, 3-6 months) before deciding whether to continue. This gives you enough time to get past the initial excitement and really experience what the activity is about. During this time, keep a simple note on your phone about what you enjoy and don't enjoy about it.

If you do decide to switch activities, try to extract the lessons and skills you've gained. Martial arts teaches discipline and body awareness that can help in football, and both build overall fitness and teamwork skills that transfer to many areas of life.

Remember that having varied interests isn't necessarily bad - many successful people started by experimenting with different pursuits before finding their path. The important thing is to give each activity a fair chance and learn something from each experience.","It's completely normal to explore different interests, especially as a teen when you're figuring out what you enjoy and what you're good at. One reason you might be switching between hobbies is that you're still discovering your passions and strengths. Martial arts and football require different skills and mindsets, so it's possible that you're drawn to the unique challenges and benefits each one offers. Instead of seeing this as a lack of discipline or commitment, try to view it as an opportunity to learn more about yourself and what you enjoy. You might consider reflecting on what specifically drew you to martial arts initially and what's causing you to lose interest now - is it the routine, the social aspect, or something else? This self-awareness can help you make more intentional decisions about how you want to spend your time and energy, and you might find that you can apply the discipline and skills you've developed in one hobby to another area of your life.","Hey, it's pretty common, especially when you're a teen, to bounce between hobbies. Your brain is still developing and you're figuring out what you really enjoy. Don't beat yourself up about it.

Instead of seeing it as a failure of discipline, maybe try to understand *why* you lose interest. Is it the initial excitement wearing off? Is the hobby harder than you thought? Are you comparing yourself to others?

For martial arts, 7 months is a decent chunk of time. Maybe set smaller, achievable goals within the hobby. Instead of ""become a black belt,"" aim for ""master this specific technique"" or ""attend class consistently for another month."" Small wins can keep you motivated.

Also, it's okay to explore! Just try to give things a fair shot before moving on. Maybe set a minimum time commitment (like 3 months) before deciding if something is truly not for you. Good luck!

t3_11m3btl,[Need Advice] my life is destroyed,"I’m destroyed my life

I’m 23 now and I’ve destroyed my life. I got out of college and went to a party school right out of high school(I had no friends in hs and I was a loser) rushed a top ranked sorority and started going out every night( I ended freshman year with a 1.0 gpa) I did better my second year but my parents caught me smoking and made me drop out of college and move home. I started dating my best friend who really cared for me at the time but I was emotionally damaged from a series of back and forth relationships and I dumped him and lost my mind. I got my drivers license at 19 and i was going back to college at said school still but ended up getting expelled from university due to me cheating. I was able to transfer to another university and continue my education there. Me and my ex got back together in the beginning of the year and he was there for me through my expulsion.
I got into a terrible series of car accidents and I was fighting with him a lot and school took a back seat. I got into a car crash so bad I busted my brain open and when I was let out of the hospital and came home I found out he was cheating. I fought to stay with him and we were together until he put his hands on me and then dumped me the next day. I was heartbroken so I decided to fix my life, I got a car moved closer to the campus of my new university and landed a dream internship. Halfway though the internship I started talking to him again and I got let go. I moved out to a new apartment and my roommates and I got along and we were friends but one of them was insane and super chaotic. They told me to not bring the ex over because they were scared he would hurt us, I invited him over two times and we kept hooking up throughout the semester. I wasn’t going to class and I started crying and isolating due to him essentially using me. In November he told me he loved someone else and I went off the deep end. I ended up with a dui and failed all of the semesters I was there except for a few classes. Post dui I’ve attempted to get my life back together, I work two jobs and put myself through school and I’m passing with all as or bs the past three semesters. I have stopped drinking and I don’t go out anymore anywhere but work and school. I’ve lost the guy who was always there for me and any friends along the way due to me chasing said guy. I have no friends, ive gained a ton of weight and all I do is work and do hw(it’s undergrad hw idk why its so hard for me to complete) and cry. I’m going to graduate soon (maybe) and I have about 30k debt: with the expulsion and the dui, the chances of getting into a masters program or a higher paying job is slim. I have about 30k in student debt and I have no car. If I get a car and insurance it will be 900 a month just insurance, I have no support system and live with my parents who hate me. I work remote and 7 days a week so everyday I wake up to the hellacious nightmare of the same reoccurring day. I want to kill myself, I work a call center job and I’m never going to get out. I’m too old for things to change, everyone has a partner and I lost the only person who cared about me. I tried dating again and it wasn’t the same. I’ve tried making new friends but no one really likes me, I’ve been in therapy for 7 years. Nothing changes, I should end it.","I would say the opposite!  Look at all that you've gone through, and come out the other side.  You are strong, resilient, and amazing.  You can do anything that you set your mind to.  So, what are you going to do?  You are living at home.  That's great, that allows you to save money and keep your living expenses as low as possible.  

That said, I hope you are able to save some money so that you can move out soon.  As for the car situation, not sure how you're getting around now, but you could get a bike, motor assisted bike, or scooter.  All of those would give you much more ability to get around, and possibly some extra exercise, too.",I have a full time jobs but I make no money right now so I could potentially work my way up in this company right now but it all feels bleak,"Hey, first off, I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. But I want to remind you that it's never too late to turn things around, and you've already shown a lot of resilience by getting back into school and working hard.

Here are a few steps that might help you regain some control and build a more positive routine:

1. **Focus on Small Wins**: You've already made progress by passing your classes and working two jobs. Celebrate those victories, no matter how small they seem. They show your capability to change and improve.

2. **Set Manageable Goals**: Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable goals. This can make your workload feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.

3. **Establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily routine that includes time for self-care, even if it's just a short walk or a few minutes of meditation. Consistency can help bring some stability to your life.

4. **Reach Out for Support**: It sounds like therapy hasn't been as helpful as you'd like, but don't give up on finding support. Consider looking for support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.

5. **Consider Professional Guidance**: If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or a hotline. They can provide immediate support and help you find a path forward.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for the support you deserve.","First off - you're 23, not 83. Your life is absolutely not over and you've already shown incredible resilience by making positive changes. Getting sober, maintaining two jobs, and pulling your grades up to As and Bs is seriously impressive. Those aren't small achievements.

The past few years have clearly been rough, but you're already doing the hard work of turning things around. Focus on what you can control right now: finishing your degree, staying sober, and maintaining your improved academic performance. These are the building blocks for everything else.

About the job situation - call centers aren't forever. Once you graduate, you'll have more options. Your DUI and academic history don't define your entire future. Many employers care more about recent performance and what you can do for them now. Keep building a solid work history and focus on developing marketable skills in your current roles.

For the immediate financial challenges: Look into income-based repayment plans for your student loans. For transportation, consider public transit or carpooling temporarily while you build up savings. $900/month for insurance is rough - that should decrease over time with a clean driving record.

Making friends as an adult takes time and consistent effort. Consider joining some hobby-based groups or volunteering - it's easier to connect with people when you're focused on shared interests or goals rather than just trying to ""make friends.""

You've already proven you can make positive changes when you commit to them. Keep building on that momentum. Take it one day at a time, and remember that your current situation is temporary. You're not too old for anything - you're just getting started.","It sounds like you've been through an incredibly tough time, and it's amazing that you're still pushing forward despite all the challenges you've faced. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and hopeless - it doesn't mean you are hopeless, though. You've already shown resilience by getting back on track with your studies, stopping drinking, and working hard to support yourself.

It might be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to tackle everything at once, focus on one thing at a time. For example, you could start by finding ways to make your daily routine more bearable, like taking short breaks during the day or finding a hobby that brings you some joy. You've also mentioned therapy, which is great - it might be worth discussing these feelings of hopelessness with your therapist to see if there are any new strategies or perspectives they can offer.

Regarding your debt and job prospects, it's true that having a DUI and expulsion on your record can make things tougher, but it's not impossible to overcome. You could look into speaking with a financial advisor about managing your debt, and consider reaching out to your university's career services for help with finding job opportunities or preparing for graduate school.

As for feeling like you're too old for things to change, that's just not true. People make significant changes in their lives at all ages, and it's never too late to start building a more fulfilling life. It might be helpful to try to connect with others who have been through similar experiences - there are many online communities and support groups where you can find people who understand what you're going through.

Lastly, please don't give up. You've made it through some incredibly tough times already, and that's something to be proud of. If you're feeling like you're in crisis, there are resources available to help - the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or you can text the Crisis Text Line at 741741. You don't have to go through this alone.","Hey, that sounds like a really tough journey, and it's understandable you're feeling overwhelmed. It takes serious strength to keep going after facing so many setbacks, so give yourself credit for making it this far.

First, please know that there are resources available if you're feeling suicidal. You can call or text 988 in the US and Canada to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or dial 111 in the UK. There are people who want to help you through this.

It sounds like you're already building some discipline by working two jobs and focusing on school. That's huge! Maybe try breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of thinking about the mountain of debt or the lack of a car, focus on one small win each day. Could be finishing one homework assignment, applying for one scholarship, or even just going for a short walk. Small wins build momentum.

Regarding the job situation, start exploring options even if it feels impossible right now. Update your resume, practice interview questions, and look for entry-level positions in fields that interest you, even if they seem out of reach. You might be surprised at what's available. Networking can also open doors, so try connecting with people in your field on LinkedIn or at industry events (even virtual ones).

As for the social isolation, it's tough to rebuild a support system. Maybe try joining a club or group related to your interests, even if it's online. Focus on being present and engaging in the activity, rather than putting pressure on yourself to make friends instantly.

It's also worth revisiting your therapy and discussing how to make it more effective. Maybe a different approach or therapist could provide a fresh perspective. Don't be afraid to advocate for your needs and explore different options.

You're not too old for things to change. You're only 23, and you have so much time ahead of you. Focus on building a life you're proud of, one small step at a time. You've got this.

t3_10ik4ea,"[need advice] working on morning routine, how to stop checking my phone","So i noticed that every morning, i want fo check my phone first. I was wondering why and it’s because i crave this connection back to the world. I want to feel connected to other people, but i was wondering if there’s a way i could replace that? because i end up staying on my phone for a long time and it makes me late for the rest of my routine.",I would advise you to leave your phone in the other part of the house before you go to sleep.,"The most important thing you can do to become more disciplined and productive is to stop checking your phone first thing in the morning. 

It's not only making you late for the rest of your day, it's rewiring your brain by elevating your dopamine levels. This makes you less motivated to do things that don't elicit as much dopamine as our phones.

Tips to help reduce your screen time are:

1. Don't sleep next to your phone
2. Delete all social media/doomscroll apps - only use them on a computer
3. Download a good screen time app. I use [Present](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1644737181?pt=125390894&ct=Get%20Disciplined&mt=8) which motivates you to stay off your phone by turning it into a game, but there are countless other good ones out there. Find one that works for you
4. Leave your phone in another room and off whenever you have to do something
5. Turn your phone to black and white mode (greyscale)
6. Turn off all non-human notifications","Hey there! It's great that you're looking to tweak your morning routine. One way to curb the phone habit is to replace it with something that still gives you that sense of connection. You could try listening to a podcast or an audiobook while you get ready. It can be a nice way to engage with the world without getting sucked into endless scrolling. Another idea is to set a specific time to check your phone, like after breakfast, so you have a clear boundary. You might also consider putting your phone in another room overnight to make it less tempting first thing in the morning. Small changes can make a big difference, so experiment and see what works best for you!","That desire to reconnect with the world first thing is super common - our phones are basically designed to hook us that way. Here's what's worked really well for me and others: get a simple alarm clock and charge your phone in another room overnight. This creates a physical barrier between you and the endless scroll.

For addressing that connection craving, try replacing phone time with a quick morning ritual that makes you feel good and ready for the day. Could be 5 minutes of stretching, writing in a journal, or even just making your bed while thinking about what you want to accomplish. The key is having something specific and rewarding to do instead.

You can still check your phone later - maybe set a specific time like ""after breakfast"" or ""once I'm dressed."" This way you're in control of when you engage with the world, rather than letting notifications dictate your morning. Start small with these changes and build from there. Your morning routine will thank you!","One strategy you could try is replacing the phone check with another activity that gives you a sense of connection or sets a positive tone for the day. This could be as simple as writing in a journal, meditating for a few minutes, or even just saying hello to a family member or pet. By doing something that brings you a similar feeling of connection or fulfillment, you might find it easier to break the habit of reaching for your phone first thing. Additionally, consider setting a specific goal for your morning routine, like enjoying a cup of coffee or tea without any screens, to help you stay focused and motivated. It might also be helpful to identify what you're typically looking for on your phone in the mornings - is it social media, news, or something else? Once you know what's driving your behavior, you can find alternative ways to meet that need later in the day.","Hey, I totally get the phone thing. It's like a reflex these days. Since you're craving connection, maybe try replacing the phone with something else that gives you that feeling, but in a more controlled way.

How about trying a quick journaling session first thing? Just jot down a few thoughts about what you're grateful for or what you're looking forward to. It can be a way to connect with yourself. Or, if you're into it, maybe a short meditation or some stretching. Even just 5-10 minutes can make a difference.

Another idea is to prep something the night before that you're excited about for the morning. Like a really good cup of coffee or tea, or a book you're enjoying. That way, you have something else to look forward to besides your phone.

Also, consider putting your phone across the room or even in another room while you sleep. That extra bit of effort to get to it might be enough to break the habit. Good luck, you got this!

t3_qwmoqm,[Need Advice] I can't start my life since I don't have a good plan. How can I provide for myself?,"Where do I begin?

I'm 18, graduated highschool 6 months ago. I live with my dysfunctional family. No college yet. I searched for jobs at all the CVS's and Sprouts stores and some other places, but I'm *never* called back. My resume is fuck all because I never made friends or joined clubs to have some kind of interesting skills or useful assets.

I thought I should go to college, but my dad who's the only bread winner violated me. I don't want anything from him so I have nothing to use. I guess I could just give up my sanity and accept him back into my life to pay for it. Or I could work, save up enough, and go to college. (Does that actually work?)

But even if I made it into college, without exaggeration: I'm not interested in anything. Ever since I was little, I found interest in something, but the next day I'm not interested in it anymore. The passion/motivation comes in inconsistent waves. Now, at 18, nothing's different. I can't find ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING that holds my interest for longer than a week. I'd end up being one of those college kids that keep changing their major every semester. How the hell am I supposed to find my ""career"" when I don't want to be stuck with doing something for the next four years? Let alone my adult life?

I forgot to mention, I can't drive either. No money for classes. I'm just a sitting duck at this point, waiting for food to come to me.","First thing's first. Don't panic. You have a slightly tough road a hoe ahead of you but it can be done.   


You absolutely can set you life on the right track without help from your Dad. MANY people have done it in the past. It is harder, and will require more dedication. But you can do it.   


It is perfectly okay for you to not have everything figured out, and to feel like you don't know what will interest you going forward. It is kinda bonkers  that as a society we expect 18 year olds to have this figured out. I remember having panic attacks when I was in MIDDLE school because people kept asking me for a career path and I was like ""!?!"" Most people don't have their lives figured out at 18. Most people don't really have their lives figured out at 30. Even if people have plans and the like, nearly everyone wildly deviates from those plans. It will be okay. You can figure this out and set to a plan.   


Now that the pep talk is out of the way here are a few ideas for you. These are not mutually exclusive. You can do some mixing and matching as much as possible.   


1) Find a job. Job searching sucks, particularly when you have no experience. Odds are you will have to work crap jobs  that don't interest you and that you don't like for at least a while. But it will be worth it because Money is independence and power. Keep applying places. Everywhere you can. Use your personal network to see who is hiring. Most people get hired in places because they know a person. Tap your old teachers for refrences. Look on job boards for jobs that require no experience. Talk to your local job and family services center. They can often hook you up, and can often help you get certifications that jobs like (such as OSHA certs).   


2) Go to community college. It is far more affordable than university. They also have access to financial aid packages and student loans just like at a university. Talk to the financial aid offices and figure out what you qualify for. Maybe you have to work through school. Maybe you have to go into debt. That sucks, but in many cases folks would argue it is worth it.  


CC is a good way to get your feet wet. Even an AA degree will open doors to many places. Here is the best part, you can use it to transfer into a university. Many universities will just look at your CC work when accepting transfer students. Heck, many of them have deals in place with local CCs that require them to accept anyone who has fulfilled certain transfer requirements. If you get an idea of what you want to do/where you want to go, do some research and see what the requirements are and what you need to achieve.   


If you don't get an idea of where you would like to go it is perfectly acceptable to just pick a nearby CC or university and start out there. Generally CC satisfies the first 2 years of a 4 year degree, meaning most of the general education requirements. Even if you go straight into university, you will spend the first couple years mostly taking general education courses before you start really focusing on a major. Use this time, at a CC or university, to relax a little and figure out what you like and what you want to do. Take a wide selection of diverse classes. See what interests you. You don't have to know going in, but you do need to  be open and self evaluative to determine what you think you can and can't do. Once you find a subject you like, go for it. I don't care what it is; don't let other people tell you it is a useless degree. No degree is useless, and any degree will often open up many doors. Beyond that you can start researching common career trajectories for folks with those degrees. There will be some. Even Art. Even Philosophy. Even literature, or history, or whatever. And if you don't want to do any of those that is fine too, but start looking into positions that just require a degree of any kind etc. Getting internships and networking during this time is also a good way to find a job.   


3) Go to trade school/get independent certifications. If you don't like college there are a lot of trades that a person can do very well at. Admittedly  I know less about this process, and it is pretty variable depending upon the trade. Some are short few month programs. Others require multiyear apprenticeships. Many technical schools will also have lots of certifications you can get, also for stuff like OSHA etc. There are also more office like varients such as certs for IT positions and for coding bootcamps, or certifications in project management etc. Point being that there are many options for trade or technical skills and training that are not associated with college explicitly.   


Odds are you are going to have to work some crappy jobs through these to pay for the school. It is also the case that you will likely have to be bottom of the totem pole for a while in any trade that you get hired into. I.e. apprentices tend to get the worst grunt work etc. However it you stick it out it can be quite lucrative, particularly when you get into the management sectors.   


4) No matter what you do, now is the time you should be researching things and reflecting on them. Get ideas. Posts like this are good, but look up resources at universities to find out what actually is required. If a field strikes you, look up good schools for it, and what you will need to do to get in. If you still have no direction research what you can do to advance a goal without definitely setting a direction. I.e., what community colleges are around, what a general education program looks like. What will a trade school require of you before you specialize in a trade, or at a technical school. etc etc.   


Point being there are things you can be looking up. Info you can be reading. Smaller, less impactful decisions you can be making which will give you time and which will help you determine what your path looks like down the road.   


You say nothing interests you for more than a week. I find that kinda unlikely. Start really giving it more though. What hobbies do you have? what do they say about you? What do you like doing? More importantly what can you be okay doing? What can you tolerate doing even if it isn't super interesting for a time. These are all important questions when you are trying to figure out what to do.","Check out www.selfauthoring.com They offer a series of writing exercises designed by clinical psychologists aimed at helping people to clarify a long term vision for their lives. IIRC, they tested it in a few universities, and it lowered the drop out rate pretty significantly.

You might also want to check out www.understandmyself.com They offer a personality assessment in accordance with the Big 5 model of Personality Theory. It can help you understand what your innate temperament and values are, what career paths would be a good fit for it, and what aspects of your personality you might want to consciously develop. 

Both are pretty cheap, evidence-based and tested. They offer much more practical insight than systems like Myers Brigs or the Enneagram or other stuff like that.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—taking that step is already a move in the right direction. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but there are definitely ways to start building a path forward.

Since you're having trouble finding a job, consider expanding your search to include online work or gigs that don't require a traditional resume. Websites like Upwork or Fiverr can be a good start for freelance work, even if it's something simple like data entry or graphic design. You can also look into local community centers or libraries for job search resources and workshops.

As for college, it's not the only path to success. Many people find fulfilling careers through vocational training or apprenticeships, which can be more affordable and quicker to complete. Look into programs that might interest you, even if it's just a little bit, and see if they offer any financial aid or scholarships.

Regarding your interests, it's okay not to have a clear passion right now. Try exploring different fields through free online courses (like Coursera or Khan Academy) to see what might catch your attention. Sometimes, interests develop over time and with exposure to new things.

Lastly, learning to drive can open up more job opportunities. Check if there are any community programs that offer free or low-cost driving lessons. It might take some time, but setting small, achievable goals can help you build momentum.

Remember, it's about taking small steps and being patient with yourself. You've got this!","First, I want to acknowledge the difficult situation you're in, especially regarding your father. Please know there are resources and support services available - reaching out to RAINN.org can connect you with people who can help.

Now for the practical steps forward: Your immediate priority should be becoming financially independent. While the job search has been frustrating, expand your search beyond retail. Look into:
- Restaurant work (dishwashing, bussing tables)
- Warehouse/fulfillment centers
- Call centers
- Security guard positions
- Package handling (UPS, FedEx)

These often have high turnover and frequently hire entry-level workers. Apply in person when possible and follow up on applications.

Regarding college - yes, working and saving for college is absolutely possible. Many students do this. Community college is a much more affordable starting point, and you can transfer credits later. They also often have career counseling services that can help you explore options.

Your shifting interests are actually pretty normal at 18. You don't need to have it all figured out right now. Instead of trying to find your ""passion,"" focus on developing practical skills that can support you while you explore different paths. Learning to code, basic office skills, or a trade can provide stable income without requiring a 4-year degree upfront.

For transportation, look into whether your area has job training programs - some offer assistance with getting a driver's license. Public transportation and bicycle commuting can work in the meantime.

Take things one step at a time. Your first goal is finding steady income. Once you have that foundation, you'll have more options to explore what direction you want to take your life.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about your future, which is totally understandable given your situation. First, let's break down some of the things you've mentioned into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of worrying about having a ""good plan"" for your entire life, try focusing on what you can do in the next few weeks or months to move forward.

You've already taken a great first step by applying to jobs, even if you haven't gotten any calls back yet. Consider reaching out to local non-profits or community organizations that might offer job training programs or resume-building workshops. These can be a good way to gain some skills and experience, and you might meet people who can offer valuable advice or connections.

Regarding college, it's not necessary to have it all figured out right now. You could look into online courses or certification programs that interest you, even if it's just for a few weeks. This can help you explore different areas without committing to a full degree program. And yes, working and saving up to attend college later is a totally viable option - many people take this route and do just fine.

As for finding something that holds your interest, don't worry if you don't have it all figured out at 18. Lots of people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and it's okay to explore different paths. You might try volunteering or taking on small projects in areas that seem even slightly interesting to you - this can help you get a feel for what you enjoy without making a huge commitment.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of small, incremental changes. You mentioned not being able to drive, but maybe you could start by looking into local transportation options or saving up for driving classes. It might not seem like much, but taking control of these small aspects of your life can help you build momentum and confidence.

Remember, you don't have to have everything figured out right now. Just take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself as you navigate this process. You got this.","Okay, that's a lot to unpack, and it sounds incredibly overwhelming. First off, it's completely understandable that you feel stuck. You're 18 and facing some seriously tough circumstances. Don't beat yourself up for not having it all figured out.

Let's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps. Forget the grand plan for now. Focus on the immediate next steps.

1.  **Job Search:** Keep applying. CVS and Sprouts are good starting points. Expand your search to include places like fast food restaurants, grocery stores (stocking shelves), warehouses, or even cleaning services. These often have high turnover and are more likely to hire someone without experience. Tailor your resume to each job, highlighting any skills you *do* have, even if they seem small (e.g., ""organized household chores,"" ""helped family with computer issues""). Even volunteering counts!

2.  **Skills & Resume:** Since you're having trouble getting callbacks, consider free online courses to boost your resume. Websites like Coursera, edX, and even YouTube have tons of free courses on everything from basic computer skills to customer service. Completing even a short course shows initiative.

3.  **Transportation:** This is a tough one without money. Look into public transportation options in your area. Even if it's limited, it's better than nothing. Also, see if there are any local programs that offer assistance with transportation for job seekers.

4.  **College:** College is a great goal, but it doesn't have to be right now. Working and saving *does* work, but it takes time and discipline. Start small. Set a realistic savings goal each month, even if it's just $25.

5.  **Interests:** The ""interest hopping"" is common at your age. Don't pressure yourself to find your ""passion"" right now. Instead, try new things without the expectation of loving them forever. Libraries often have free workshops and events. Community centers might offer affordable classes. Just explore!

6.  **Dysfunctional Family:** This is the hardest part. Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel unsafe, reach out to a trusted friend, family member (if possible), or a local support organization. There are resources available to help you navigate this.

The key here is to break down these big problems into smaller, actionable steps. Focus on one thing at a time. Celebrate small victories. And remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this.

t3_12w7lt2,"[Need Advice] I’m in Russiа and I might get drafted, yet I’m too lazy to do anything","Hi, everyone. My current situation is absurdly bad and I have no clue what to do. I asked people on some other subs, but ultimately every single variant is fucked in some way and it’s hard to choose the best one of them.

In a month I’ll be 18, which means I could get conscripted to the army and I’d probably end up in Ukraine, which not only I believe is plainly wrong and immoral, to me that would also be a death sentence. Knowing all of that, I want to get out of here, but here’s a problem - I don’t have any money and my parents neither.

Lack of support in this tough situation really makes me feel awful. I’ve got nobody nowhere. I am on my own in this very fucked up place.

See, despite being in such a bad situation, I can’t do anything. I used to be on medication for depression (it wasn’t a clear diagnosis, but two psychiatrists said I should use the meds) and recently I stopped using them, because I’m too lazy to go to a psychiatrist once again to get a new prescription. You could say: “Oh, the reason you’re not doing anything is because you’re not on meds”, but the truth is, it was exactly the same way as before.

Instead of researching new options, I’m positing here on reddit waiting for people to tell me new variants. Instead of actually doing anything meaningful, I just go do my hobbies, like music production and UI design and I still have no clue how to make money in these two spheres.

I’m literally slowly causing my own demise. It’s fucking awful. But I’m just too tired. I don’t know what to do. Even the possibility of dying doesn’t make me care about it.

How can I possibly start doing something and be more disciplined? I truly want to get out of here, but I’m just tired of everything.

If you’d like to read some more about my situation, [here’s the link to it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12qev2h/iwantout_17m_russia_anywhere/)

Thanks for reading this.",Not at all. You will probably be mistaken as an american spy.,"I understand that Ukraine is happily accepting Russian soldiers who surrender, and they will even help your family across the border to start a new life in Ukraine.","Hey there, it sounds like you're in a really tough spot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. First off, it's important to acknowledge that taking care of your mental health is crucial, especially in such a stressful situation. If you can, try to get back on your medication or seek some form of mental health support, even if it's just talking to someone you trust.

As for building discipline, start small. Pick one thing you can do each day that moves you closer to your goal, no matter how minor it seems. It could be researching ways to make money with your skills in music production or UI design, or even just setting aside 30 minutes a day to improve those skills. Consistency is key, and small steps can lead to bigger changes over time.

Also, consider reaching out to communities or organizations that might offer support or advice for your situation. Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone can make a big difference. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and taking action, even in small ways, can help you regain some control over your situation. Stay strong.","Your situation is genuinely urgent, and the fact that you recognize the disconnect between the severity of your circumstances and your current actions is actually a good starting point. Let's focus on breaking through this paralysis.

First, get back on your medication. This isn't about discipline - it's about giving yourself the basic tools you need. Make it the ONE thing you do tomorrow. Just that single task. You mentioned being too tired to care, and that's exactly what depression does - it makes everything feel impossible and pointless.

For immediate action steps: Start with 25-minute blocks using the Pomodoro technique. Your first block should be researching exactly what you need to do to leave. Just 25 minutes. You can do anything for 25 minutes. Write down everything you find. When the timer ends, take a break with your music or UI design. Then do another 25 minutes.

Each day, commit to just two 25-minute blocks of focused work on your exit strategy. That's less than an hour total. Break down what you find into small, specific tasks: ""Find out visa requirements for X country"" or ""Calculate minimum costs for travel to Y.""

The key here isn't becoming disciplined overnight - it's about doing the bare minimum needed to keep yourself safe. Think of it like this: you don't need to become a different person, you just need to do enough to get yourself out of danger. Once you're in a safer situation, you can work on longer-term discipline.

Start with those 25-minute blocks today. Not tomorrow. The timer on your phone is already there. Use it right now.","Given your situation, it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck. First, let's break down the immediate need to address your potential conscription and the desire to leave Russia. While it's great that you have hobbies like music production and UI design, leveraging them to make money could be a starting point. You might not know how to monetize these skills yet, but there are plenty of online resources and communities dedicated to freelance work and remote jobs that could help.

To start building discipline, consider setting very small, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to researching ways to monetize your hobbies or looking into organizations that might assist with relocation due to conscription concerns. The key is to make these goals so manageable that you can't help but achieve them, which will hopefully build some momentum.

It's also important to address your mental health. While you've mentioned stopping your medication due to laziness, it might be worth reaching out to a psychiatrist again or exploring online therapy options that could offer more accessible support. Your mental well-being is crucial in navigating this challenging situation.

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of community and support. Besides Reddit, there might be other forums or social media groups focused on helping individuals in similar situations. Connecting with others who understand your plight can provide valuable advice, emotional support, and potentially even leads on how to improve your circumstances.

Remember, taking control of your situation is a process, and it doesn't have to happen overnight. Start small, focus on building habits that contribute to your goals, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter setbacks. You're not alone in feeling this way, and there are resources available to help you navigate both the practical and emotional aspects of your situation.","Hey, that sounds like an incredibly tough situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. It's a lot to process.

First, it's okay to feel tired and unmotivated right now. You're facing a huge amount of stress. Don't beat yourself up for not being at your peak performance.

As for getting started, maybe try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Instead of ""researching new options,"" aim for just spending 15 minutes looking at *one* specific thing related to getting out. Just 15 minutes. Set a timer. If you want to stop after 15, that's fine. The goal is to just get the ball rolling.

Same with your hobbies. You mentioned music production and UI design. Could you dedicate just 30 minutes a day to learning one specific skill related to making money from them? Maybe watch a tutorial on freelancing for UI designers, or research platforms for selling your music. Again, small, manageable chunks.

The key is to lower the barrier to entry so much that it feels almost effortless to start. Once you're in motion, it's easier to keep going. And celebrate those small wins! Acknowledge that you spent 15 minutes researching, or 30 minutes learning a new skill. It's progress, even if it feels tiny.

Also, about the medication, even if it didn't feel like a miracle cure before, it might be worth trying to get back on it, even temporarily, just to see if it helps you get a bit more clarity and energy. It's one less thing to worry about if it does help.

You're not alone in feeling this way, and you're capable of more than you think. Start small, be kind to yourself, and focus on taking those tiny steps forward. Good luck.

t3_xhhjft,[need advice] How do you feel purpose in life?,"I’m not talking about in your career but in your personal life. I wake up every morning and for the majority of my day when I don’t have to work I’ll just sit on the couch/my bed doing a combination of drinking coffee, browsing reddit/internet and just sitting doing absolutely nothing (as in staring at wall or roof nothing). It’s not laziness but rather I don’t feel much purpose in doing anything. I have a garden that I should work in more but That I don’t really care about as much as I used to. I want to learn a language and get good at drawing but when I actually think about why I realize I don’t have any reason. How do I get that feeling of purpose in doing things again?","You start with getting more self awareness.

When was the last time you had a long talk with yourself about what you truly want to get out of life? What things, experiences and traits do you value most? If time and money didn't matter, what would you be doing with your time and your life? What gets you excited beyond any form of reason? 

You don't randomly feel purpose in life, you've got to actively search for it and create it. It starts with those kinds of questions.","I'd suggest starting with something small. I feel you very well, when you mention this and that and that one, and one more thing. Obviously, you can't do lots of small things 'a little bit' - they'll take away your focus and energy.

Instead, start with... nothing. Do an experiment: try to avoid social media for, let's say, one day. Keep it simple. Then try for more. Keep it going.

Once you have this vacuum of where to 'send' your attention - you'll start wanting to do other stuff. You'll have that purpose. It's just 'browsing internet/reading reddit' is somethign that takes it away for now.","Finding purpose can be a bit of a journey, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. One approach is to start small and build momentum. Try setting a tiny, achievable goal each day, like spending just 10 minutes in your garden or sketching something simple. The key is consistency, not perfection. Over time, these small actions can reignite your interest and help you discover what truly matters to you. Also, consider exploring new activities or volunteering, which can provide a sense of contribution and connection. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Purpose often unfolds as you engage with life, so give yourself the grace to explore and experiment.","Finding purpose often starts with taking small actions, even before you feel motivated. The catch is that purpose and meaning usually come *after* we start doing things, not before. It's like pushing a car - it's hardest to get moving from a standstill, but once you build momentum, it gets easier.

Try this approach: Pick one small activity (like drawing for 10 minutes or learning 3 new words in your target language) and commit to doing it daily for just one week. Don't worry about having a grand reason - just treat it as an experiment. The purpose often reveals itself through the doing.

For example, you might start drawing and discover you enjoy the meditative aspect of it, or find that learning a language connects you to interesting people and cultures you hadn't considered before. Your garden might become meaningful again when you focus on growing one new plant or creating a small peaceful corner for yourself.

The key is to start small and stay consistent. Purpose isn't usually found through thinking about it - it emerges from engaging with life, trying things out, and gradually building connections with activities and people. Even if you don't feel like it, pick one tiny action and start today. The meaning will follow.","It sounds like you're struggling to find intrinsic motivation for activities outside of work, which can be really tough. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on the process, rather than the end goal. For example, instead of thinking ""I want to learn a language,"" try saying ""I'm going to spend 10 minutes today looking at a language learning app and seeing what it's like."" This can help you build momentum and find enjoyment in the activity itself, rather than just doing it for a specific reason. 

Also, consider exploring why you used to enjoy gardening and what changed. Was it the sense of accomplishment, the time outdoors, or something else? Identifying what specifically brought you joy might help you find other activities that give you a similar feeling. As for drawing, you could try setting aside some time to just doodle or create without any specific goal in mind - sometimes having fun with an activity can help you discover a new purpose or passion. 

Lastly, it might be helpful to think about what kind of person you want to be and what values you want to live by. What's important to you? Do you value creativity, self-improvement, or helping others? Aligning your activities with your core values can give you a sense of purpose and direction. Remember, it's okay to take your time figuring this out and it's normal for your interests and passions to evolve over time.","Hey, I get that feeling of just...existing. It's tough. It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, and that lack of purpose is really draining.

Instead of trying to find some grand, overarching purpose, maybe try focusing on smaller, more immediate goals. You mentioned the garden and learning a language/drawing. Don't think about ""getting good"" right away. That's overwhelming. Think about just doing *something* small each day.

For the garden, maybe it's just weeding one small patch for 15 minutes. For the language or drawing, maybe it's just 10 minutes of Duolingo or a quick sketch. The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no.

The purpose might not magically appear, but the act of *doing* something, even something small, can often create its own momentum and a sense of accomplishment. And who knows, maybe that small action will spark a renewed interest in the garden or those creative pursuits. Good luck!

t3_ys1amz,[Need Advice] I'm feeling lost in life and unmotivated,"not feeling motivated in life?

Everytime I think about the future I just see this void. When I was younger I had dreams and ambitions. One of them was to be an actress but I grew out of that dream and no longer want it. Now I completely feel lost in life cause I don't know what I want anymore. And i don't just mean career wise because that's just a very small part of it. Even money don't motivate me that much anymore. I have a job and I get paid every week. I feel like if I was  the same person I was when I was younger I would be so happy to have that money and don't get me wrong, I am happy to get paid every week and I am thankful and i like the fact that i get to buy stuff but there's also this numbness inside of me that's just like ""Okay but have nothing to spend it on"" I feel like all I do now is save save save but I don't have an actual goal or destination. I know if I were to get rich right now I would be so empty and dead inside because I honestly don't even know what my purpose is on this earth or where I'm going from here. I just feel lost and numb to my future...","As someone who has struggled with this as well; first off it does get better. My best advice is to ground yourself more. When you're feeling lost you're actually casting judgment on the world and your life, you're interpretating things in a way that doesn't point forward anymore.  Don't cling too tightly to any self definition or sense of ego if you start to regain it, you're always changing.

I would advise you to lead with your heart instead of your head. If you've struggled with these things for a while, coming to the very true realization that our perception of the world is fallible and learning to rely on a sense of community/interconnectedness, and an acceptance of paradoxes for this reason is important. 

Feeling lost/like life is meaningless is actually our rational brain's attempt at understanding the world as a constant framework. Rather than seeking a constant (which you will never find) you can move forward in a way that never demands it, but is still positive (this is how we all were as kids, where we decided we didn't know enough about how the world worked yet). Hope that makes sense.",For people struggling existentially like this I can speak from personal experience what OP needs is something to ground them to life and a stabilizing interpretation to move forward; meditation is great but it can actually wipe away these and force you to a horrible existential place where all exterior connection is removed,"Feeling lost and unmotivated is something many of us go through, so you're definitely not alone. It sounds like you're in a phase where you're reassessing what truly matters to you, which can be a great opportunity for growth. One approach you might find helpful is to start small and explore new interests or hobbies. This doesn't have to be anything big or life-changing right away, just something that piques your curiosity. It could be a new skill, a creative project, or even volunteering. These small steps can help you rediscover what excites you and gradually build a sense of purpose. Also, consider setting short-term goals that are meaningful to you, even if they're not career-related. This can give you a sense of direction and accomplishment. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Give yourself the grace to explore and evolve.","It's completely normal to feel directionless after outgrowing previous dreams - this is actually a sign of growth, not failure. The void you're experiencing might be an opportunity to explore and discover new interests without the pressure of your younger self's expectations.

Instead of focusing on finding your life's grand purpose right away, try starting small. Pick up a new hobby each month - maybe photography, rock climbing, writing, or cooking. The goal isn't to find your passion immediately, but to expand your experiences and see what naturally catches your interest.

For the money you're saving, consider allocating some of it specifically for trying new experiences. Set aside a ""discovery budget"" - maybe 10% of your savings - purely for exploring activities that might spark joy or curiosity. This gives your saving a immediate purpose while you figure out longer-term goals.

Remember that finding direction is an active process, not a passive waiting game. Start volunteering, join local groups, take classes, or travel to new places. Each experience, even if it's not ""the one,"" helps you understand yourself better and narrows down what truly matters to you.

Your current state of questioning and searching isn't a permanent condition - it's a transition phase that many people go through. Keep moving forward, stay curious, and be patient with yourself as you discover new possibilities.","It sounds like you're feeling a bit unmoored without a clear direction or passion driving you. One thing that might help is to start exploring small, everyday activities that bring you joy or a sense of fulfillment - it doesn't have to be related to your job or long-term goals. This could be anything from painting, hiking, cooking, or even just trying out a new coffee shop. Sometimes, discovering these small pleasures can help you reconnect with what makes you tick and give you a sense of purpose. You might also consider setting aside some time for self-reflection, whether that's journaling, meditating, or just taking long walks. Ask yourself questions like what values are most important to you, what kind of person do you want to be, and what kind of life do you want to lead. It's okay if you don't have all the answers right now - just taking small steps towards figuring out what feels meaningful to you can help you build momentum and start to fill in that void you're feeling. Remember, it's a process and it's normal to feel lost sometimes - the fact that you're acknowledging these feelings and wanting to make a change is a great first step.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a pretty common phase of life where you're re-evaluating things. It's tough when the old dreams don't fit anymore and you haven't found new ones yet.

Instead of focusing on some grand purpose right away, maybe try exploring different things that spark your interest, even in small ways. Think of it like experimenting. Is there a hobby you've always wanted to try? A skill you'd like to learn? A place you've wanted to visit? It doesn't have to be life-changing, just something to break the routine and see if it ignites something.

Also, since you mentioned saving, maybe think about reframing your savings goal. Instead of just saving for ""nothing,"" could you save for a specific experience, like a weekend trip, a class, or a piece of equipment for a new hobby? Having a tangible goal might make the saving feel more meaningful.

Finally, don't put too much pressure on yourself to find ""the"" purpose. Sometimes purpose emerges from the things we enjoy and the connections we make along the way. Just keep exploring and being open to new experiences, and you might be surprised at what you discover. Good luck!

t3_y7spio,[Need Advice] 26(M) unable to take actions in my life and always feeling lost & confused.,"I feel like for a  long time I am not taking any action in life to move forward or making any progress. Whenever I think about taking any action it causes stress. 
I understand nothing will change unless I take action upon it. A miracle won’t happen if all I do is sit and watch life go by. I just don’t know why I’m not taking actions in my life and working on my daily tasks such as goals and things I need to work on which is getting a job, deciding what major to take and fully put my dedication determination in it, learning a new skill to learning to drive a car. Like I just pity myself so much at this point that I feel like I’m a letdown to myself and my family. I don’t know when I will get out of this trap that I’ve created within me.","You're overthinking.

Overthinking is a paralyzing poison.

I've been in these exact same shoes (worse even, almost killed myself) and wasted years of my life, until I started living by this one single mantra, recommended by my therapist.

>Don't think, just act

You want to learn to drive a car? Break it into tiny doable steps first. Say, step one would be to contact the driving instructor. And then you should vocalize the above line ""Don't think, just act"". You don't even need to think about what you'll say to him. You should just pick up your phone and dial the number. That's the job. Don't think anything more. Call him. And take it from there.

You are wound up about doing any activity? (Make sure the activity is manageable first of) All you need to do in that instant is recite the above mantra. 

You know that all you need to do is act. The trick to doing so is stop overthinking. And I can't stress this enough, quote the above at every instant your mind thinks of doing anything. Use the quote as a trigger to seize all thoughts and just getting your ass up and doing it.

I know it's counter intuitive to not think about something to really do it. All out logic says that the more I think about a certain task, the more familiar I will get with it and the easier it must be to do. Bur trust me when I say it doesn't work this way. Overthinking is the not the answer.","This, but also: Try to do really nothing for a while. Don't turn on your pc or use your phone. After a while, your brain starts to come up with shit to do. All the distractions are keeping you from doing things. When your bored it's easier to motivate yourself to do things.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but recognizing that you want to change is a huge first step. Here’s a simple approach that might help: start small. Pick one thing you want to work on, like learning to drive or exploring a new skill, and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. For example, if it's driving, maybe start by reading about the basics or watching a few videos. Set a small goal each day, even if it’s just 10 minutes of focus. Celebrate those small wins because they build momentum.

Also, try to set a routine. Having a daily schedule can reduce the stress of decision-making and help you feel more in control. Remember, it’s okay to feel lost sometimes, but taking small, consistent actions can help you find your way. You’ve got this!","Hey there. What you're experiencing is actually pretty common - that paralysis that comes from feeling overwhelmed by all the things you need to do. The key is to break free from this cycle by starting incredibly small.

Pick just ONE thing from your list - the smallest, least intimidating task you can think of. Maybe it's spending 10 minutes researching potential majors, or looking up the requirements for getting a driver's license in your area. The specific task doesn't matter as much as just getting started with something manageable.

Set a timer for 10 minutes and work on just that one tiny piece. When the timer goes off, you're done. No pressure to do more. The goal here isn't to solve everything at once - it's to prove to yourself that you can take action, even if it's small.

Do this every day for a week. Same time each day, same 10 minutes. Once this becomes easier (and it will), gradually increase the time or add a second small task.

Remember that progress isn't linear. Some days you might only get through 5 minutes, and that's okay. What matters is showing up consistently and proving to yourself that you're capable of moving forward, even if it's just baby steps.

You've already taken the first step by recognizing you want to change and reaching out for advice. That shows you've got more strength than you're giving yourself credit for. Now it's time to channel that into small, consistent actions.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed, which is making it hard for you to take action towards your goals. First, let's acknowledge that recognizing the problem is a huge step, so kudos to you for admitting it and seeking help. Now, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, why not start with something small? Pick one task or goal that's been weighing on your mind, like learning to drive or updating your job search materials, and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. This could be as simple as dedicating 10-15 minutes a day to working on that task. The key is to build momentum and confidence by achieving these small wins. Additionally, consider setting aside some time for self-reflection to understand what's causing your stress when you think about taking action - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you identify the root cause, you can start working on strategies to overcome it. Remember, progress might be slow at first, but it's better than staying stuck. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","Hey man, I get it. Feeling stuck is a really tough place to be. It sounds like you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of things you want to change, and that's causing you to freeze up.

Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, how about picking *one* small thing to focus on this week? Seriously, just one. Maybe it's spending 15 minutes researching potential majors, or watching a YouTube video about driving. The key is to make it something so small that it feels almost effortless.

Once you've done that one small thing, give yourself credit! Acknowledge that you took action. Then, next week, try to build on that. Maybe research majors for 30 minutes, or schedule a driving lesson.

The idea is to build momentum and confidence. Small wins can really add up over time. Don't beat yourself up for not being perfect; just focus on making a little bit of progress each day. You got this!

t3_qfejgi,[Need Advice] I get too scared to work on my assignments,"I often procrastinate with my assignments out of fear, I find myself doing anything possible to avoid the task at hand because it’s too daunting so I wait until the clock is shoving me to start the work, days before the deadline which never goes well because it’s just sleep deprivation and mental breakdowns.

The 5 second rule doesn’t even work for me because my head knows I’m trying to trick myself, my brain has also gotten so good at rationalizing and reasoning my avoidance behaviors that I don’t even really feel guilty in the moment for not doing the work like I used to. It feels like I have reached new heights with procrastination and can’t seem to avoid it, it’s probably the worst it’s ever been. 

Another thing to note is that I really struggle to sit at my desk with my computer. Even when I force myself to sit at my desk to start my work (sometimes even being in tears out of sheer fear) I get started on the work but the slightest inconvenience like struggling to find a file or waiting for a software to open gets me distracted and before I know it I’m back in bed avoiding the task. If I somehow manage to start the task because I have everything set up and it’s going smoothly my body literally will make me feel the need to shit, pee, get thirsty, feel cold/hot just so I can have an excuse to get up and delay the task more.

It usually ends decently I’ve never failed an assignment but have gotten a passing grade once as a result of procrastination so it always feels like I can get away with it. Im not bad at the school either the work I do is usually of good standard after all this so sometimes it really really bugs me knowing how much better I could do when I don’t get the high grade I want or knowing how I could have gotten this grade minus the breakdowns and hits to my mental health if I managed my time better. Every time I don’t get the grade I want I also get very easily discouraged and just think that I’m either just dumb or bad at the work that it hinders my potential or any chance of really trying.

 If anyone has this same issue and can help with any advice or suggestions please feel free.

Edit: Grammar",This is EXACTLY what's going on with me. Looking forward for suggestions.,"I just started posting on here, but first off to the tool who said ""stop acting like a baby"" that dudes an idiot who doesnt understanding the anxiety you are probably experiencing at finishing tasks. 

  
First off, its totally normal to experience the kind of anxiety that you are and trying to figure out how to fix it is super commendable. I would say, as someone who is 33, that the importance of trying to address this ASAP can't be understated. Synapses that fire together wire together, so the longer this happens the harder it is to break - so treat it as important as that. 

  
I read several books saw alot of therapists, yada yada - what really spoke to me was atomic habits. And basically what he preaches is measurement and incremental improvement. This isn't going to change overnight. Nothing I say, or anyone says, is going to make this go away tomorrow its a process at getting 1% better everyday. What I do is journal in the morning, make intention just write out all my thoughts, write my todo list and do journaling checkins at 2PM, 5PM, 8PM. When you fail at some of the todo list items, like writing your paper, try to ask yourself why. Study yourself, figure out how you could have made it gone differently? Could you have started with an outline, that slowly progressed? Could you have worked with another person? Write that as the test for tomorrow, and then try that. When that fails, keep trying. **Eventually** you'll find something that works for you. And you will relapse into another rut, what matters is not failing at a task, its showing up consistently with the process. 

&#x200B;

There are also therapists, coaches, doctors, etc. What I would say about medication is try to use it as a crutch with the intent of just supporting the healthy habits and getting off at some point but to each his own.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common struggle, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few strategies that might help you tackle this:

1. **Break it Down**: Try breaking your assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and give you a clearer path forward. For example, instead of thinking about writing an entire paper, focus on just writing the introduction or outlining your main points.

2. **Set a Timer**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and make the task feel less daunting. Plus, knowing a break is coming can make it easier to start.

3. **Create a Routine**: Establish a consistent study routine. This can help train your brain to get into ""work mode"" more easily. Try to work at the same time and place each day, and keep your workspace tidy to minimize distractions.

4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself small rewards for completing tasks. This could be a treat, a short walk, or some time to relax. Positive reinforcement can make it easier to build new habits.

5. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you notice yourself rationalizing procrastination, try to challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself of the benefits of starting early and how good it feels to finish without the last-minute stress.

Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!","Your situation with assignment anxiety and procrastination is really common, especially since you've been ""successful"" with last-minute work before. But that cycle of avoidance, panic, and mental health hits isn't sustainable.

Let's break this down into something more manageable. Instead of trying to sit down for long stretches, start with tiny work sessions - seriously, just 10 minutes. Set a timer. The goal isn't to finish anything, just to open the file and look at it. When the timer goes off, you can take a break. This helps your brain learn that starting work isn't actually dangerous.

For the physical restlessness, try to preempt it. Before sitting down, use the bathroom, get water, adjust the temperature. Then make a deal with yourself - you'll stay in the chair until the timer goes off, no matter what. Your brain will eventually learn that these ""urgent"" needs aren't really urgent.

Something that might help with the perfectionism piece: try deliberately doing a ""rough draft"" approach. Tell yourself this first attempt is supposed to be bad. It takes the pressure off and gives you something to improve later.

The key is to stop viewing this as a willpower battle. Your brain has learned some pretty effective avoidance patterns, so we need to create new patterns that feel safe and doable. Start small, be consistent, and focus on building the habit rather than the outcome.

Remember - you're clearly capable of doing good work, as shown by your grades. Now it's just about finding a way to access those capabilities without the unnecessary suffering.","It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty tough cycle of procrastination and self-doubt. One thing that might be helpful is to break down your assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks. This could make them feel less daunting and allow you to focus on one step at a time. Additionally, trying to create a comfortable and distraction-free workspace might help - this could be as simple as using a website blocker or finding a quiet spot to work. 

It's also interesting that you mention your body finding ways to distract you from the task at hand. This might be a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the work, and taking regular breaks to stretch, move around, and refresh your mind could help mitigate this. 

In terms of building motivation and discipline, it might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and reward yourself when you meet them. This could be something as simple as taking a walk or reading a chapter in a book you enjoy. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be perfect, and that everyone struggles with procrastination and self-doubt at some point. 

Lastly, it might be helpful to reflect on why you're feeling so much fear and anxiety around your assignments. Is it the fear of failure, the pressure to perform well, or something else entirely? Understanding the root cause of your procrastination might help you address it more effectively. Remember that you've been able to complete your assignments and achieve good grades despite your struggles, so it's clear that you have the capability to succeed - it's just a matter of finding ways to work with your mind and body to make the process less painful.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That procrastination spiral sounds rough, but it's definitely something you can break out of. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety around starting, which is fueling the avoidance.

Instead of trying to bulldoze through it with willpower (which clearly isn't working), maybe try some strategies to lower the initial hurdle. Could you break down your assignments into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps? Like, instead of ""write essay,"" it's ""open document"" or ""write one sentence."" Seriously, make it so easy you almost can't say no. Once you've started, the momentum might carry you further.

Also, your environment seems to be a trigger. Try working somewhere else entirely – a library, a coffee shop, even just a different room in your house. A change of scenery can sometimes disrupt those ingrained avoidance patterns.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're clearly capable, and you've proven you can get the work done. Instead of beating yourself up for procrastinating, acknowledge the anxiety and reward yourself for even small steps forward. Maybe after writing that one sentence, you get to watch a short video or grab a snack. Positive reinforcement can be way more effective than self-criticism in the long run. Good luck, you got this!

t3_tvnend,[need Advice] Need advice (more like a cry for help),"So i am writing to you all in hopes for advice (more like a cry for help) with my problem. Basically my problem is I never finish something that i start. For example i wanted to learn how to work on cars. For the first two to three days when i was researching about cars i was fully motivated. The next day no more motivation, like i couldn't be bothered and so i just give up, same goes for when i wanted to learn how to play the guitar and many more hobbies/projects. And with every project/hobby that i don't finish i just feel worse and worse about myself. Is there anyway to get out of this hellish rut? I've been like this for almost my entire life i am currently 22 years old and i want to change myself for the better, because currently my feelings twords me are, that i am just a fraud. So please any advice would be greatly appriciated","Some people that love to start things and never finish them only look toward motivation, or ‘positive feelings’ in order to make progress on something. The reality is life is mostly difficult and you will need to rely on perseverance when motivation fails you. 

Perhaps you can break up your goals into smaller goals to feel a sense of accomplishment. Learn three chords, learn a song, learn how to pick a song, and therefore you are a basic guitar player! 

Another thing you can do to improve endurance or perseverance is to keep going for an extra 10 minutes when you feel bored/disengaged/or otherwise feel like stopping and keep increasing the times or amount of time you extend your working ‘streak’. 

There is no quick fix to discipline, it is hard work, perseverance, and a sense of accomplishment with each step or goal you’ve met. I wish you well! Keep on keeping on.","""[...] rely on perseverence when motivation fails you.""

I'll write this on a peace of paper on my wall. It is smth I need to remember more than I already do. 

Thank you! 😇✌","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. A lot of people struggle with staying motivated, so you're definitely not alone. One thing that might help is shifting your focus from motivation to building habits. Motivation can be fleeting, but habits are more reliable. Start small—pick one thing you want to work on and set a tiny, manageable goal. For example, if it's learning guitar, commit to just 5 minutes a day. The key is consistency, not intensity. Over time, these small actions can build into a routine. Also, try to connect with a community or find a buddy who shares your interest. Having someone to share progress with can keep you accountable and make the process more enjoyable. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and it's normal to lose interest sometimes. The important thing is to keep coming back to it. You've got this!","What you're describing is super common - getting excited about something new, then losing steam after a few days. The key is understanding that motivation is unreliable, but discipline can be built.

Start incredibly small. Instead of ""I'm going to learn cars,"" pick something specific like ""I'll watch one 10-minute video about basic car maintenance every day."" The goal isn't to become an expert overnight - it's to build consistency.

Set a specific time each day for your chosen activity. Maybe it's right after dinner or first thing in the morning. Stick to this time religiously, even if you only do it for 5-10 minutes. This builds a habit loop that doesn't rely on motivation.

Also, give yourself permission to suck at things. Everyone starts as a beginner. Those guitar players you admire? They all started with sore fingers and terrible chord transitions. Success isn't about maintaining constant enthusiasm - it's about showing up consistently, even when you don't feel like it.

Try picking just ONE thing to focus on for the next month. Set a ridiculously achievable daily goal related to it. Track your progress in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar. After 30 days, you can decide if you want to continue or try something else - but commit to those 30 days, no matter what.

Remember: you're not a fraud. You're someone who's learning how to build lasting habits, and that's a skill in itself. Start small, be consistent, and trust the process.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common pattern of starting strong but losing momentum, which can be really frustrating and affect your self-perception. One strategy that might help is to focus on building small, consistent habits rather than relying on motivation alone. For example, instead of trying to dedicate hours to learning about cars or playing guitar, start with a manageable daily goal, like 10-15 minutes of practice or research. This can help you build a sense of progress and accomplishment, even on days when you don't feel motivated. Additionally, try to identify the specific reasons why you lose interest or get discouraged - is it because the task gets too difficult, or because you're not seeing immediate results? Once you understand your patterns, you can develop strategies to overcome them. It might also be helpful to find an accountability partner or join a community related to your interests, so you can stay engaged and motivated with support from others. Remember that developing discipline and persistence takes time, and it's okay to start small - the fact that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to change is a huge step forward, so don't be too hard on yourself.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to feel that initial burst of motivation and then have it fizzle out. Don't beat yourself up too much about it.

One thing that might help is breaking down those big goals into *tiny*, manageable steps. Like, instead of ""learn to work on cars,"" maybe it's ""watch one 10-minute YouTube video about car engines"" or ""identify 5 basic tools used for car repair."" Seriously, make them ridiculously small. The point is to build momentum and get some quick wins.

Also, try to schedule these small tasks. Put them in your calendar like appointments. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day. Consistency is key, even if it's just a little bit at a time.

Finally, and this is important, try to focus on the process, not the outcome. Enjoy the act of learning, even if you don't become a master mechanic or guitar virtuoso. The goal isn't necessarily to become an expert, but to enjoy the journey and build that habit of sticking with things. Good luck, you got this!

t3_10286s9,[Need Advice] i know all the theory,"I know all the theory. Napoleon Hill, David Goggins, Jocko Willink, Epictetus, Eric Thomas , Angela Duckworth, Mel Robbins, Simon Sinek.... Etc.. but still i wake up and stay in bed. For hours.

I work with something i dont like. At 3 PM i AM free. And then i could do my real goals. But i surf on youtube and reddit and twitter until 11 PM and sleep.

I believe i am somewhat a nihilist.",Have you been screened for Depression ADHD etc?,Make your bed. The second you awake.,"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, and that's totally okay. Knowing the theory is a great start, but putting it into practice can be tough. Here’s a simple approach you might try: start small. Pick one thing you want to change and focus on that. For example, if you want to get out of bed earlier, set an alarm and commit to getting up as soon as it goes off. Reward yourself for sticking to it, even if it’s just a small treat or a few minutes of something you enjoy.

Also, try setting a specific time for your goals after 3 PM. Make it a non-negotiable appointment with yourself, just like your job. It might help to limit your time on social media by setting a timer or using apps that block distractions. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. You’ve got this!","Reading theory is great for understanding, but it won't create change on its own - you need to start taking small actions. The gap between 3 PM and 11 PM is prime time that you could use differently.

Here's what I suggest: Start by picking just ONE thing you want to do after work. Make it small and specific - not ""work on my goals"" but something concrete like ""write for 30 minutes"" or ""practice guitar for 20 minutes."" Then, set an alarm for 3:30 PM. When it goes off, immediately do that one thing before touching YouTube/Reddit/Twitter.

The key is making it small enough that it feels doable. You don't need motivation or inspiration - you just need to do that one tiny thing consistently. Once you build momentum with one small win, you can gradually expand.

As for the nihilism - action is actually the antidote. Theory and endless scrolling keep you in your head, while doing real things (even small ones) connects you to meaning through experience rather than just ideas.

Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick your one small action, set that alarm, and focus on building that single habit first. The theory you've learned will make more sense once you're actually putting it into practice.","It sounds like you're struggling to bridge the gap between knowing what you should be doing and actually taking action. This is really common, especially when you feel unfulfilled in your daily work. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're aware of your patterns and willing to change them. 

One potential strategy could be to start small - instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, try committing to just 30 minutes of focused time on your goals after you're done with your day job. This could be as simple as journaling, reading something related to your goals, or doing some light planning. The key is to build momentum and make progress feel achievable.

It might also be helpful to explore why you feel so disconnected from your current work - is it the type of work itself, the work environment, or something else? Sometimes, making small changes to our daily routines or finding ways to make our work more meaningful can help us feel more energized and motivated.

As for the nihilism, it's possible that feeling unconnected to your goals and values might be contributing to that sense of emptiness. By taking small steps towards your goals and exploring what truly matters to you, you may start to feel more purposeful and directed. Remember, discipline is about progress, not perfection - it's okay to take things one step at a time.","Okay, so you're stuck in the theory trap. You've got the knowledge, but the execution is missing. That's super common, don't beat yourself up too much.

Here's the thing: knowing *why* to do something is different from *actually* doing it. You're basically fighting your brain's reward system. YouTube and Reddit are easy dopamine hits, while your goals require effort and delayed gratification.

First, tackle the morning. Even Goggins probably snoozes sometimes. Try this: put your phone across the room. Set an alarm for, say, 30 minutes *later* than you usually get up. When it goes off, you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off. Then, immediately do something small and productive. Make your bed, drink a glass of water, do 5 pushups. Anything to break the cycle of staying in bed.

Second, the 3 PM to 11 PM window. That's your prime time, and you're wasting it. Instead of trying to eliminate YouTube cold turkey (which rarely works), try this: schedule it. Seriously. Tell yourself, ""Okay, from 3 PM to 3:30 PM, I can watch YouTube."" Set a timer. When the timer goes off, you *have* to switch to working on your goals for at least an hour. Then, you can schedule another YouTube break later. It's about controlling the habit, not eliminating it entirely.

Finally, the nihilism. That's a bigger issue, but even if you think nothing matters, *you* still matter. You're still experiencing life. So, why not try to make that experience a little better? Focus on small, achievable goals. Celebrate small wins. Maybe the meaning will come later, or maybe it won't. But either way, you'll be a little less stuck. Good luck!

t3_wo2mns,[need advice] I watched 53.5hrs of YouTube this week.,"Long term daily average is 7.5hr https://ibb.co/wpHHYdY. I watch everything on 2x speed so it's even worse. I guess I justify it to myself by not watching gaming videos or anything like that it's always vaguely educational. And that doesn't even account for all the time I spend on Reddit. I'm literally addicted to these apps. I've tried uninstalling them and installing blockers but I always get bored or depressed and end up reinstalling them to distract myself.

I work a full time job as well so my life has basically comes down to wake up - work - distract myself with YouTube and reddit until I fall asleep. I'm sick of it. There are things I want to learn. goals I want to achieve but I'm so undisciplined I can't do anything.

Find local groups in your area or zoom groups on a hobby you can relate with. Best of luck, I hope you can find a way to spend your time wisely from now on (or in the future)👍","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to make a change. That's a huge first step. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start by setting a small daily limit on YouTube and Reddit. Maybe cut it down by an hour or two each day. Use that time to focus on something you want to learn or achieve. 

2. **Create a Schedule**: Try to structure your day a bit more. Allocate specific times for work, learning, and relaxation. Having a routine can help reduce the urge to fill every free moment with distractions.

3. **Find Alternative Activities**: When you feel the urge to watch YouTube or browse Reddit, have a list of alternative activities ready. This could be reading a book, going for a walk, or working on a hobby. 

4. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on what you did and how you felt. This can help you become more aware of your habits and make conscious decisions about how you spend your time.

5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community where you can check in regularly. Having someone to hold you accountable can be a powerful motivator.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. You've got this!","First off - you've already taken a huge step by tracking your usage and acknowledging this isn't how you want to spend your time. That awareness is crucial.

The key here isn't going cold turkey (which clearly hasn't worked), but rather gradually replacing these apps with more meaningful activities. Start small - pick ONE thing you want to learn or goal you want to achieve, and commit to just 30 minutes after work before allowing yourself YouTube time. Make it something enjoyable that you actually want to do, not just something you think you should do.

A technique that's helped many people is the ""activity transition"" approach. When you get home from work, instead of immediately grabbing your phone, do something physical first - even if it's just changing clothes, having a shower, or making tea. This creates a mental break between work and free time, making it easier to choose a different activity.

For the YouTube habit specifically - try setting up ""speed bumps"" rather than complete blocks. Keep YouTube, but make it slightly harder to access: log out each time, remove it from your home screen, or only allow yourself to watch it in a specific spot in your house. The goal is to make it just inconvenient enough that you have to consciously choose to watch rather than doing it automatically.

Remember that boredom and discomfort are normal parts of breaking any habit. Instead of seeing them as signals to go back to YouTube, try to sit with them for just 5 minutes. Often they'll pass, and you'll find yourself able to focus on something else.

You've got this. Focus on progress, not perfection, and celebrate small wins along the way.","Watching 53.5 hours of YouTube in a week is a significant amount of time, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your life. First, let's acknowledge that it's not just about cutting out YouTube or Reddit entirely, but about finding a healthier balance and replacing that time with activities that align with your goals.

It's interesting that you mention watching educational content, but still feeling unfulfilled. This might suggest that while the content itself isn't the issue, the passive nature of consumption is. Have you considered taking online courses or working on projects related to the topics you're interested in? This could help you feel more engaged and motivated.

Regarding your struggles with uninstalling apps and using blockers, it might be helpful to identify the underlying issues that lead you to reinstall them. Are you using them as a coping mechanism for boredom, depression, or stress? Finding alternative ways to manage these emotions, such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits, could help reduce your reliance on these apps.

To start making changes, you might want to try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like dedicating 30 minutes each day to a new activity or hobby. You could also try implementing a ""stop doing"" list, where you identify specific times of the day or week when you tend to mindlessly scroll through YouTube or Reddit, and replace those habits with something more productive.

It's great that you're reaching out for help, and many people have overcome similar struggles. You might find it helpful to share your goals and progress with a friend or accountability partner to provide an added motivation boost. Remember, developing discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. What do you think is the first small change you could make to start moving in a more positive direction?","Hey, I've been in similar spots before, and it sucks feeling like you're just stuck in a loop. First off, don't beat yourself up too much – recognizing the problem is a huge first step.

It sounds like you're using YouTube and Reddit to avoid boredom and depression, which is a pretty common coping mechanism. The key is to find healthier replacements, not just cut them off cold turkey, because that's why you keep relapsing.

Instead of uninstalling completely, try setting really strict time limits using built-in phone features or apps. Like, *really* strict. Start with something uncomfortable but doable, like 2 hours total a day, and gradually reduce it.

More importantly, you need to actively schedule in those things you *want* to learn and those goals you want to achieve. Don't just think about them, put them in your calendar like they're important appointments. Even 30 minutes a day dedicated to one of those goals is a massive improvement over 7.5 hours of YouTube.

Also, think about *why* you're bored or depressed. Is there something deeper going on? Maybe exploring that with a therapist or counselor could help you address the root cause instead of just the symptoms.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It's a process, not a switch you can flip. Celebrate small wins, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. You got this!

t3_zxfgw3,[Need advice] How to reset your relationship with food?,"I have been emotional eating for quite a long time. It takes a toll on my health, makes me feel guilty later and also gives me crazy abdomen pain. I want to eat healthy and have a good, healthy, happy relationship with food. How to start? Please help.","All the above is good advice. However, try to do one thing at a time. I had pretty bad relationship with food when I first ventured out on my own. I skipped breakfast and was so tired that would eat ramen, sandwich or takeout for dinner. I can cook very well but it can be hard to cook all the time and my perfectionist tendencies made me procrastinate. So, I started with one small thing. Eating bfast. A banana with coffee and then something else later on. Now, I am onto meal prepping parts of the dishes as I do complete meals with salad + entree. They make me excited to sit down and eat mindfully. So, I make it easy to put together dinner. I have 5-6 options for bfast and I keep them all very simple. I do still sometimes skip lunches and wish if a tablet could replace food. However, I am happy where I am and just going up from here. All the best to you.","I've been working to change my relationship with food starting by identifying what triggers me into emotional eating. Then I worked on my relationship with my body, where previously I hated myself and didn't care if binge eating hurt me, or that the things I was feeding myself had painful reactions. So I started making notes of symptoms after eating certain foods. Like pizza. It was my huge emotional food, but it would make me incredibly sick. So I tested out food intolerances, a week without gluten, a week without dairy, until I figured out what my body LIKES. Now I take a pill for lactose intolerance and a gluten enzyme, and use portion control, and haven't been sick anymore.","Resetting your relationship with food is a great goal, and it's awesome that you're taking steps to address it. Start by identifying your triggers for emotional eating. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know what sets it off, you can work on finding healthier coping mechanisms, like going for a walk, journaling, or talking to a friend. Planning your meals can also help. Try to include a variety of foods that you enjoy and that nourish your body. This can make you feel more in control and less likely to reach for comfort foods impulsively. Remember, it's okay to have treats now and then—balance is key. Lastly, be kind to yourself. Building a healthy relationship with food takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!","Here's what helped me reset my relationship with food - start by keeping a food journal for a week, but not to count calories. Instead, write down what you eat and how you feel before, during, and after. This helps identify your emotional eating triggers and patterns.

Once you spot those patterns, work on building new responses to those triggers. When you feel the urge to emotional eat, try taking a 10-minute walk, doing some quick stretches, or calling a friend. The key is having specific alternatives ready to go.

For the physical side, focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting. Stock up on easy-to-grab healthy snacks you actually enjoy. Make sure you're eating regular meals - hunger makes emotional eating much harder to resist. Start small by adding one piece of fruit or veggie to each meal.

The guilt cycle you mentioned can make things worse. Remember that changing your relationship with food is a gradual process. If you have a moment of emotional eating, acknowledge it without judgment and move forward with your next meal. Each meal is a fresh start.

Consider working with a registered dietitian if possible - they can create a personalized plan that takes your specific triggers and health needs into account. The goal isn't perfection, it's progress toward a healthier relationship with food.","Resetting your relationship with food can be challenging, but it's definitely possible with a gradual and mindful approach. A good starting point could be to identify your emotional triggers for eating - is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you're aware of these triggers, you can begin to find alternative coping mechanisms, such as going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Additionally, consider seeking help from a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can guide you on developing a balanced eating plan that suits your needs and preferences. It might also be helpful to start keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and emotions, which can provide valuable insights into your relationship with food. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection - focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes rather than trying to overhaul your entire diet at once. You got this, and taking that first step towards a healthier relationship with food is already a huge accomplishment.","Hey, it's tough dealing with emotional eating, but it's definitely something you can work on! A good first step is to start tracking what you're eating and, more importantly, *when* and *why* you're eating. Just a simple food diary can reveal patterns you might not be aware of.

Next, try to identify your triggers. What situations or feelings lead you to emotional eating? Once you know what they are, you can start brainstorming alternative coping mechanisms. Instead of reaching for food when you're stressed, maybe try going for a walk, listening to music, or calling a friend.

Don't try to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Small, sustainable changes are key. Maybe start by swapping out one unhealthy snack a day for something healthier, like fruit or vegetables. And be kind to yourself! It's okay to slip up sometimes. The important thing is to learn from it and keep moving forward. If you're really struggling, consider talking to a therapist or registered dietitian – they can provide personalized support and guidance. You got this!

t3_vx6uct,[Need Advice] I just turned 31 and my life is a *huge* mess.,"Hey guys

I’m a 31-year-old man and I’ve reached a point where I’m at my wit’s end and I just don’t know what’s wrong with me or what to do.

I’m just going to list the big issues in my life and hope that someone can offer up some advice. Here goes:

* **I’ve never been able to finish a degree.**  

   * I’ve started and dropped out of three courses since I was 18.
   * I’ve finally made it through \*most\* of a law degree. I have just 6 months remaining (after taking a 2-year break) but cannot bring myself to study AT ALL.
* **I constantly feel exhausted and low in energy.**  

   * I’ve felt “sluggish” my whole life. I process information and learn slowly, I’ve never been able to just get sh\*t done.
   * I have serious sleep issues and can rarely fall asleep before 3am.
   * Even when I can get a decent sleep, I wake up feeling unrefreshed.
   * My weight has fluctuated a fair bit my whole life. I'm pretty fat now and despite eating very healthy I can't lose any weight this time.
   * I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve been trying different meds for almost 2 years but nothing has made a difference.
* **Zero motivation**:  

   * I have a full-time job (I’m studying part-time) and I constantly feel on the verge of being fired because I’m hopeless at deadlines and have no motivation to do the work they pay me to do.
   * I have big dreams but just feel too lazy to achieve anything. I want to do well and meet my goals so much, but something is holding me back and I just feel paralysed.
* **I feel socially weird**  

   * Work meetings, for example, are a huge source of anxiety - even though people seem to think I’m normal and outgoing. I have the same issues with attending classes.
* **I constantly feel like the dumbest person in the room**  

   * I have a reputation got being smart and everyone seems to think I’m smart, but I feel like I’ve just fooled everyone because, to be honest, I feel like I don’t understand things 99% of the time.
* **My apartment and my finances are a f\*\*king mess**. My bedroom is disgusting (to the point of being unsanitary) and I have debt collectors after me.

**TL;DR:**

For a grown who is seen by most people as intelligent, together and competent, my life is secretly a damn mess. I’m always tired and have zero motivation to do anything. Please help me!

Thanks so much :)","Hey, congratulations for expressing yourself, you can be proud of you. That's not an easy thing to do. In my opinion, you lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. Only you can know why and how to improve it. You'll find what's best for you. To know what's best, you have to compare, in order to compare, you have to try different things. Pick what works for you, leave what doesn't. 

But remember that you become what you do, only actions are effective. And if you feel like not having the will power to try something you have never tried, it's either you evolve trying, or you remain the same. But you can't expect different results by repeating the same actions. 

It's gonna be a beautiful journey, don't lose faith in yourself. We all have deamons to fight, keep grinding, keep shining. Peace","I feel like getting to the heart of your sleep problems will help a lot with almost everything else on this list? Like if you can, find some way to access a sleep specialist, spend some money on it if you can, really try to get a decent sleep schedule. Try everything you can, this matters a lot. 

Sleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won't magically fix everything, but I feel like it's a good first step.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.

2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels—there might be underlying issues that need addressing.

3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.

4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.

5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It’s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.

6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.

Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You've got this!","First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many successful people deal with similar challenges behind closed doors. The good news is you've already taken two huge steps: getting diagnosed with ADHD and recognizing these issues need addressing.

Let's start small. When everything feels overwhelming, trying to fix everything at once usually backfires. Pick ONE thing to focus on first - I'd suggest your sleep schedule since that affects everything else. Start by setting a firm ""screens off"" time 1-2 hours before your target bedtime. Even if you can't sleep, just lie there in the dark. Your body needs to relearn proper sleep patterns.

For the immediate term, tackle your bedroom. A chaotic environment makes everything harder, especially with ADHD. Set a timer for just 20 minutes and clean what you can. Tomorrow, another 20 minutes. Don't try to perfect it - just make it livable.

Regarding your law degree - you're so close. Instead of thinking about the whole six months, break it into tiny chunks. Study for just 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), then take a break. Even one Pomodoro per day is better than nothing. Build from there.

For work and motivation - external accountability helps tremendously with ADHD. Could you find a study buddy for law school? Or ask your boss for more frequent check-ins on projects? Sometimes just having to report progress to someone else can provide that extra push.

Keep working with your doctor on the ADHD meds. Finding the right medication and dosage often takes time and experimentation. While you're figuring that out, focus on building small, sustainable habits rather than relying on motivation.

You haven't fooled anyone - imposter syndrome is real, but the fact that others see you as competent suggests you're more capable than you give yourself credit for. Take it one day at a time, one small win at a time. You've got this.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of challenges that are all interconnected, which can be really overwhelming. One thing that might help is to focus on building small habits and routines that can help you gain momentum and confidence. For example, instead of trying to tackle your entire law degree at once, try setting a goal to study for just 15-20 minutes each day. That way, you can build up your endurance and make progress without feeling overwhelmed. 

Similarly, with your energy levels and sleep issues, it might be helpful to establish a consistent bedtime routine and try to create a relaxing sleep environment. And with your motivation and productivity, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can help make them feel less daunting.

It's also important to remember that you're not alone in feeling like you're ""fooling"" people or that you don't understand things as well as you think you should. A lot of people struggle with imposter syndrome, and it's okay to ask for help and admit when you don't know something.

In terms of getting your apartment and finances organized, it might be helpful to start with small steps, like setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to tidy up or work on a budget. And don't be afraid to reach out to a financial advisor or therapist for support - they can provide you with personalized guidance and help you develop strategies to manage your debt and anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to have everything figured out right now, and it's great that you're taking the first step by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep in mind that building discipline and changing habits takes time, so be patient with yourself and try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect.","Okay, so you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's totally understandable given everything you've listed. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Let's break this down into smaller, manageable steps.

First, tackle the physical stuff. Your health and environment are foundational. Since you're already eating healthy but not losing weight, maybe get a check-up with your doctor to rule out any underlying issues, especially given the fatigue and sleep problems. Addressing the sleep is crucial. Try setting a strict bedtime routine – even if you don't fall asleep right away, dim the lights, avoid screens, and try some relaxation techniques. Consistency is key here. As for the apartment, don't try to clean everything at once. Pick *one* small area, like your bedside table, and focus only on that. Once that's done, move on to the next small area. Small wins build momentum.

Next, let's look at the law degree. Six months is a relatively short time. Can you break down your remaining coursework into tiny, achievable tasks? Instead of ""study law,"" think ""read one page of my textbook"" or ""review my notes for 15 minutes."" Set a timer and commit to just that small amount of time. You might find that once you get started, you can keep going. If not, that's okay too. You still accomplished something.

For the job, talk to your manager. Explain that you're working on improving your time management and ask for specific feedback on deadlines. Sometimes just having a clear understanding of expectations can reduce anxiety.

Finally, regarding feeling ""dumb,"" remember that everyone has imposter syndrome sometimes. Focus on your strengths and what you *do* know. Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to where you were yesterday.

The key here is to start small, be consistent, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it seems. You've got this.

t3_rwi1jh,"[NEED ADVICE] I've no idea how to effectively structure my week to include all my tasks, work and hobbies.","I need help with creating some form of structure that I can actually stick to. I have so many interests! I like to read, learn Spanish, gym, listen to music and podcasts and on the weekends hike and socialise. I also work 8.30am - 6pm Mon - Fri. I get really tired after work.

I have borderline adhd so its difficult to stick to things. My problem is that I get HYPER FOCUSED on each interest for weeks or months and neglect the rest.

How can I include all of my hobbies and interests within my week in a structure thats easy to follow? 

I've read atomic habits but didn't really stick with it.

My goals are to continue learning Spanish, read 1-2 books a month, gym 3-4 times a week and fit all of these around my work schedule..

Can anyone help me or point me in the right direction?","i think the best start is to create a week long timeblock excel spreadsheet and lay it all out there. it’ll help declutter your mind. i felt overwhelmed figuring out work, hobbies, and household chores, but once i put it in a spreadsheet it helped a lot just having it all visually in front of me","Nah, just add learning excel onto tasks you need to complete.","Creating a balanced schedule when you have so many interests can be tricky, especially with the challenge of hyperfocus. Here’s a strategy that might help: 

Start by prioritizing your interests and goals. Since you want to learn Spanish, read, and go to the gym regularly, try setting specific days for each. For example, you could dedicate certain weekdays to the gym and Spanish practice, and reserve reading for evenings or weekends. 

Consider using time blocks to manage your activities. After work, set a timer for 30-45 minutes for one activity, then switch to another. This can help prevent hyperfocus on one thing. 

Also, try to integrate your hobbies into your daily routine. Listen to Spanish podcasts during your commute or while cooking. This way, you’re learning without needing extra time. 

Remember, it’s okay to adjust your schedule as you go. The key is to start small and gradually build a routine that feels natural. Good luck!","Hey there! Your situation really resonates with me, especially the hyper-focusing part. Having multiple interests is awesome, but it can definitely be tricky to balance them all.

Let's break this down into something manageable. Since you work full-time and get tired after work (totally normal!), let's create a sustainable schedule that doesn't burn you out.

First, try time-blocking your weekdays. After work, give yourself 30-60 minutes to decompress - this isn't wasted time, it's necessary recharge time. Then dedicate specific weekdays to specific activities. For example:

Monday: Spanish (45 mins)
Tuesday: Gym
Wednesday: Reading (30-60 mins)
Thursday: Gym
Friday: Spanish or Reading (whichever you feel like)
Weekend: Hiking, socializing, and one gym session

The key here isn't perfection - it's consistency and flexibility. When you feel the urge to hyper-focus on one activity, channel that energy into your designated time slot. If you really want to do Spanish on a reading day, that's fine! Just try to get back to your routine the next day.

For Spanish and reading, shorter, consistent sessions are better than long, sporadic ones. Try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. This works great for ADHD-like tendencies.

Start with this for two weeks. Don't try to be perfect - aim for 70% adherence. That's enough to build momentum while being realistic. You can adjust the schedule based on what works and what doesn't.

Remember: progress isn't linear. Some weeks you'll crush it, others you won't. That's completely normal. The goal is to keep showing up, even if it's just for 15 minutes.","It sounds like you're dealing with a common challenge of having multiple interests and struggling to balance them with your work and daily life. Given your borderline ADHD, it's great that you're aware of your tendency to hyper-focus on one thing at a time. To create a structure that works for you, I'd suggest starting small and building habits incrementally. 

Consider allocating specific days or timeslots for each activity, taking into account your energy levels after work. For example, you could dedicate Monday and Wednesday evenings to Spanish learning, Tuesday and Thursday evenings to gym sessions, and Friday evenings to relaxation or a low-key hobby like listening to music or podcasts. 

Since you mentioned getting really tired after work, it might be helpful to schedule activities that require less energy or can be done in shorter intervals, such as reading or language learning, during your weekdays. You could try breaking these activities into smaller chunks, like 20-30 minutes a day, to make them more manageable.

On weekends, you can prioritize hiking and socializing, and maybe even squeeze in some longer reading sessions or Spanish practice if you feel up to it. It's also essential to leave some buffer time for spontaneity and flexibility, so you don't feel overwhelmed by your schedule.

As for the Atomic Habits approach not sticking, you might want to revisit the concept of ""habit stacking"" – where you build new habits onto existing ones. For instance, you could try listening to Spanish podcasts or audiobooks during your daily commute or while doing chores, effectively combining two activities into one timeslot.

Lastly, be patient and kind to yourself as you experiment with different structures. It may take some trial and error to find a rhythm that works for you, but with persistence and self-compassion, you can develop a routine that accommodates your diverse interests and energy levels.","Hey, I totally get the struggle – so many interests, so little time (and energy after work!). It sounds like you're dealing with a classic case of hyperfocus, which can make consistency a real challenge.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire week at once, maybe start super small. Like, *really* small. Think ""atomic habits"" but even tinier. For example, instead of ""gym 3-4 times a week,"" aim for ""put on gym clothes after work on Monday and Wednesday."" That's it. If you end up going to the gym, great! If not, you still accomplished the habit. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry so much that it's almost impossible *not* to do it.

For Spanish, could you commit to just 15 minutes a day using Duolingo or listening to a podcast while you commute? For reading, maybe read just one page before bed. The key is consistency over intensity, especially with ADHD.

Also, consider time blocking, but with a twist. Instead of rigidly scheduling everything, create ""theme days."" For example, Monday could be ""Movement Monday"" (gym or a hike), Tuesday could be ""Tune-In Tuesday"" (music/podcasts), Wednesday ""Words Wednesday"" (Spanish/reading), and so on. This gives you a general direction without feeling too restrictive.

Finally, be kind to yourself! It's okay to miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress. Good luck!

t3_11gpe6g,[Need Advice] How do I train my brain to think critically?,"I'll be honest I went into a long depression after high school and didn't really use my brain. I kinda just existed and social media brainrot didn't help much. 

Now I'm 24 and it's a struggle to keep up in my community college courses because I get headaches just from thinking and I'm not retaining any information. 
It's like my brain got so used to not being used, that any effort is headache-inducing. 

I haven't been able to read a book completely since my teens (I skimmed for my previous college courses). 

I want to change that. I miss reading. What can I do to buff up my brain but not overwhelm it?","To think critically look at all sides of an issue without bias to determine which one makes more sense. 

From the sound of this post though, it seems you ruined your attention span. Try to remove distractions and force yourself to finish things.

You just need to deny your brain the instant dopamine rush it’s craving for awhile. Eventually it’ll reset.","Try to improve without trying. Sounds silly but you t works.

Start reading or studying without too much intention of it. Start with 5mins and gradually increase it to hour over the period of 1 to 3 months. Your objective should be simple. Just want to do the activity without any expectation of remembering it.

Once routine is set then instead of increasing time, focus on remembering just 1 line or 1 small information for few hours. Revision that information on weekly bases. 

Once you can do 1 line easily then increase to 2 and so on.

Believe me it works . You will be definitely new you in year time .. just make sure to not set any goals. Just become a mechanical person who follow his set routine everyday","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're taking steps to get back into reading and critical thinking. It can be tough to get back into the swing of things, but it's definitely doable with some patience and consistency. Start small to avoid overwhelming yourself. Try setting aside just 10-15 minutes a day to read something you enjoy—maybe a novel or a non-fiction book on a topic you're curious about. Audiobooks or podcasts can also be a good way to ease back into it if reading feels too daunting at first.

For critical thinking, consider engaging with puzzles or brain games that challenge you but are still fun. Apps like Lumosity or even simple Sudoku can be a good start. Also, try to actively question and analyze the information you come across daily, whether it's news articles or social media posts. Ask yourself what the main point is, what evidence supports it, and what might be missing.

Remember, it's about building a habit, so consistency is key. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if progress feels slow. You've got this!","First off - you're already on the right track by recognizing this and wanting to make a change. The brain is like a muscle, and just like getting back into exercise after a break, you need to start slow and build up gradually.

Start with 10-15 minute reading sessions. Pick something you genuinely enjoy - could be fiction, manga, whatever interests you. The key is to actually read, not skim. Set a timer and stick to it, even if it feels challenging. When the time's up, take a break.

For your coursework, try the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused study, followed by a 5-minute break. During those 25 minutes, put your phone in another room and close unnecessary browser tabs. This helps train your focus muscle while giving your brain regular recovery periods.

To help with retention, try active recall. After reading a paragraph, look away and explain it to yourself in simple terms. For your college material, write quick summaries in your own words. This engages your brain more than passive reading.

Those headaches might be from eye strain or tension. Make sure you're reading in good lighting, taking regular breaks, and staying hydrated. If they persist, it's worth checking with a doctor.

Remember - your brain hasn't lost its capability, it just needs consistent training to get back in shape. Start small, be consistent, and gradually increase your ""mental workout"" time as it gets easier.","It's great that you're recognizing the need to improve your critical thinking skills and get back into reading. Given your history of not using your brain as much, it's understandable that it feels like a struggle now. One approach could be to start small and build up gradually - try setting aside a short time each day, like 10-15 minutes, to do some mentally stimulating activity, such as solving a puzzle, doing a simple math problem, or reading a short article. As you get more comfortable, you can increase the duration and difficulty level. 

For reading, you might want to start with shorter texts, like essays or blog posts, before moving on to full-length books. You could also try listening to audiobooks or podcasts to get your brain used to processing information again without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, taking breaks and getting enough sleep is crucial, as it will help your brain consolidate the new information and reduce fatigue. It might be helpful to talk to your community college instructors about your struggles too - they may be able to offer additional support or recommendations tailored to your courses. Remember that it's a process to get your brain back into shape, so be patient with yourself and don't be too hard on your progress.","Hey, it's awesome that you're recognizing this and wanting to make a change! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common situation, and it's totally possible to get your brain back in shape.

First, be patient with yourself. You're essentially retraining your brain, and that takes time and consistency. Don't beat yourself up over the headaches; think of them as your brain's way of saying, ""Okay, I'm working here!""

Start small. Instead of trying to dive into dense textbooks, begin with something lighter and more engaging. Maybe try short stories, articles on topics you're genuinely interested in, or even well-written blog posts. The key is to make it enjoyable so you're more likely to stick with it.

Try the Pomodoro Technique. Work in focused bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you avoid overwhelming your brain and make the process more manageable. During your breaks, step away from screens, stretch, or do something relaxing.

Active recall is your friend. After reading a paragraph or section, try to summarize it in your own words. This forces your brain to actively process the information, which helps with retention. You can even try explaining what you've read to someone else (or even just to yourself in the mirror!).

Consider talking to your doctor or a counselor about the headaches. They might have some suggestions for managing them, or be able to rule out any underlying medical issues.

Finally, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Every page you read, every concept you grasp, is a victory. You got this!

t3_u2yoti,[Need Advice] I am trying to get my life together but I feel like I'm just spinning in circles,"I've made a goal tracker for myself so many times in the past and tried my best to reach them; exercise, read, study, but after the first few weeks I end up feeling so trapped in the routine of doing it I hit a depressive episode and end up stopping. I've done this so many times in the past that I honestly doubt now if I will ever get any of the habits down and I am incredibly frustrated and tired because of it. I feel like I am stuck in one of those hamster wheels, spinning it but getting no where.   
Any advice on getting over this will be appreciated","Let go of perfection. You won’t feel like studying or exercising every day, no one does. You could try to make it a goal to sit down at your desk and open your book/computer that day, even if you don’t write anything down, that’s part of the habit you’re creating. For exercise - put on your sneakers and maybe tell yourself you only need to walk outside for five minutes. Usually once you’re there starting then you’ll feel like it, and putting less pressure on yourself helps.

Do you have any one you can meet up with to study with? Any book clubs you can join online to motivate you to read to not fall behind?

Another thing with exercise is finding something you actually like doing, not an exercise for the sake of it.

You’re not alone, I often feel the exact same way when I’m having a low energy few days, but I’m slowly finding things that work for me.","Start with one thing and start small. Maybe start with studying. Once you have a strong studying habit, add exercise. The once you've developed that, add reading. But don't rush. It'll take time (at least 21 days, if not more) to develop each one.","It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to stick to a rigid routine, which can be overwhelming. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick one habit you want to build and focus on that. Make it as easy as possible to start with, like just 5 minutes of exercise or reading a page a day. Once that feels natural, gradually increase the time. Also, try to connect your habits to something you enjoy or find rewarding. This can help make the process feel less like a chore. Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Progress isn't always linear, and taking small steps consistently can lead to big changes over time. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small wins!","It sounds like you might be taking on too much at once and creating routines that feel restrictive rather than sustainable. Instead of trying to overhaul everything simultaneously, try picking just one small habit to focus on for now - something so easy you almost can't fail at it. Maybe that's reading for 5 minutes, or doing 2 pushups, or studying for 10 minutes.

The key is to make it ridiculously achievable. When you consistently hit these tiny goals, you'll start building confidence and momentum. Then you can gradually increase the duration or difficulty as it starts feeling natural.

Another approach that might help break the cycle: give yourself permission to be inconsistent. Rather than viewing habits as all-or-nothing commitments that you have to maintain perfectly, treat them more like experiments. If you miss a day or even a week, just pick back up where you left off without beating yourself up about it.

Remember that building lasting habits is more like slowly turning a ship than flipping a switch. Small, consistent actions over time will get you much further than intense bursts followed by burnout. Start smaller than you think you need to, celebrate the tiny wins, and be patient with the process.","It sounds like you're experiencing a common pattern of burnout from trying to stick to overly ambitious routines. One thing that might help is to focus on building habits incrementally, rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine at once. Instead of setting a goal to exercise every day, for example, try starting with just 2-3 times a week and see how that feels. You can always add more days or intensity later. 

Also, consider prioritizing flexibility and self-care in your routine. It's great that you're recognizing the signs of burnout and depressive episodes, so make sure to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and adjust your goals as needed - it doesn't mean you've failed, it just means you're learning and adapting.

Another approach could be to focus on the underlying reasons why you want to build these habits, rather than just the habits themselves. What is it about exercising, reading, or studying that's truly important to you? Is it to feel more confident, to learn new things, or to improve your mental health? Connecting with your ""why"" can help make the process feel more meaningful and sustainable. 

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory along the way, even if it feels insignificant. You've already taken a huge step by recognizing your patterns and seeking advice, so that's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, and try to be patient with yourself as you figure out what works best for you.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of spinning your wheels. It's super common to get burned out when you try to overhaul everything at once. Maybe instead of focusing on a bunch of habits, try picking *one* thing and making it ridiculously easy to start. Like, instead of ""exercise,"" aim for ""walk for 5 minutes"" or instead of ""read,"" aim for ""read one page."" The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no.

Once that one tiny habit is solid (like you're doing it without even thinking), *then* you can gradually increase the time or intensity. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches. If you hate running, don't force yourself to run! Find an exercise you actually enjoy. Same with reading – try different genres or formats (audiobooks, maybe?).

And remember, it's okay to take breaks. Discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about getting back on track after you stumble. Be kind to yourself, and celebrate the small wins. You got this!

I see others in my family succumbing to it, and it’s scary. My favorite cousin is looking at serious prison time through a series of completely preventable situations because he’s not aware of how influenced he is. 

In my early 20’s if I hated a job, I would just quit. I was taught that “others” are the problem. I thought this was completely normal. I was discouraged from attending college. When I attended anyway and wasn’t doing well (had a toddler and was a single mom) I was encouraged to quit and “be a mom” instead. I was told college is for rich white kids and I was already too smart to need it. I listened. 

Growing up, I never witnessed anyone succeed at anything. My family was chronically homeless, in debt, and with gambling issues. I’m not just talking about my parents either. We moved around constantly due to evictions. My parents moved from job to job. They never had goals, were never financially secure, and in some cases dissuaded me from auditioning for things or joining teams at school because they didn’t want the additional expense. 

I was wildly naturally talented with zero support. I moved in with a friend in high school because my parents moved to another city and I loved the teams I was on and didn’t want to quit. Her family had money and I’m so grateful they helped support me.

Fast forward to my 30s. I have a good career, a loving partner, and my son has done well. Yet I cannot shake the urge to flee when things get difficult. I never realized it was unusual until now. I’m just now learning in my 30’s that the magic is in the day to day and I’ve totally sabotaged all of the success I deserve and worked so hard for by quitting too soon.

Even knowing this, I’m struggling in my pattern. I feel like I’m cycling. I’ll be doing well, something will knock me a little off course, and I completely shut down and am ready to give up. I hate that I’m like this. It means I’ll never reap the rewards of my monumental but unfocused efforts. I have definitely put so, SO much effort in. 

Has anyone dealt with fighting against weak conditioning like this? I could use advice.","Feeling like you're cycling does not mean you're actually cycling. In fact, based on your post it seems like you have successfully and against the odds built a great life yourself.

It's okay to relapse once in a while into old ways of thinking. By being aware, you already won 50% of the battle. When you feel like you're spiraling, double down in your self care, and remember that you have choice. And you can choose to be brave and know that your feelings may not reflect reality. You can choose to address intergenerational trauma head on. And in doing so you're setting an incredible example for your family. I don't think there's actually a way to never have the negative feelings come back, only empower yourself with the tools/ therapy to pull yourself out. And then over time, it gets easier. At least this has been my experience.","I really appreciate this. 

You are right - maybe those feelings never go away but can be used in a positive way…as a reminder.","It sounds like you've already made some incredible strides despite the challenges you've faced, and that's something to be proud of. Breaking free from ingrained patterns is tough, but it's definitely possible. One approach is to start small and build consistency. Pick one area where you feel the urge to quit and set a small, manageable goal. Commit to sticking with it for a set period, like a month, no matter what. This could be a hobby, a fitness routine, or a work project. The key is to prove to yourself that you can push through discomfort and see things through. 

Also, consider surrounding yourself with people who have the mindset you aspire to. Whether it's friends, mentors, or online communities, having a support system that encourages perseverance can make a huge difference. Lastly, when you feel the urge to quit, take a moment to reflect on why you started and what you stand to gain by sticking with it. Sometimes, just pausing to remind yourself of your goals can help you push past the immediate desire to give up. Keep going—you've got this!","First off, you've already shown incredible resilience by recognizing these patterns and breaking away from them enough to build a good career and provide stability for your son. That's huge.

The ""flee when things get difficult"" response is essentially a learned survival mechanism. You can absolutely rewire it, but it takes conscious effort and small wins to build up that new neural pathway. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:

Start tracking your ""quit impulses"" in a notebook. When you feel that urge to give up, write down what triggered it and rate the intensity from 1-10. This helps you spot patterns and takes some of the power away from that immediate emotional response.

Then pick something small but challenging - could be a 30-day exercise commitment, a short online course, or a work project. The key is to choose something where failure won't have major consequences. When you feel like quitting (and you will), acknowledge the feeling but stay put for just 5 more minutes. Then another 5. Build up your ""discomfort tolerance"" gradually.

The real game-changer is redefining what success looks like. Instead of seeing it as this big end goal, celebrate staying in the game when it gets tough. Those moments when you want to quit but don't? That's where the actual growth happens.

You might also benefit from finding a ""stability mentor"" - someone who's good at staying the course through challenges. Watch how they handle setbacks. What's their thought process? Sometimes just seeing a different approach in action can help rewire our own responses.

Remember, you're not fighting against your nature - you're building new capabilities. Every time you push through that quit impulse, you're literally creating new neural pathways. It gets easier with practice, but you have to give yourself time to develop this new skill.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to change the patterns that have been ingrained in you, especially when they're rooted in your upbringing. Recognizing the urge to flee when things get difficult is a huge step, and it's great that you're aware of it now. One thing that might help is to start small - when you feel like quitting or shutting down, try to push through just a little bit longer. Set tiny, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate when you reach them. This can help build confidence and reinforce the idea that you can persevere through challenges.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can work with you to identify and challenge these negative patterns. They can also provide you with additional tools and strategies to help you stay on track. Additionally, surrounding yourself with positive influences and supportive people can make a big difference. It sounds like your friend's family was a great source of support for you in high school - try to find people like that in your life now who can encourage and motivate you.

Lastly, be patient with yourself. Changing deeply ingrained habits and thought patterns takes time, effort, and perseverance. Don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up - instead, learn from your mistakes and use them as opportunities to grow. You've already come so far and achieved a lot, and it's clear that you're capable of more. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.","Hey, your story really resonates. It sounds like you've overcome a lot already, and recognizing these patterns is a huge first step. It's totally understandable that you're struggling to shake off deeply ingrained habits.

One thing that might help is focusing on building small, consistent wins. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one area where you tend to quit and set a ridiculously small, achievable goal. For example, if you tend to quit projects, commit to working on one for just 15 minutes a day. The point isn't to get a ton done in those 15 minutes, but to build the habit of showing up even when you don't feel like it.

Another thing that could be useful is to identify your triggers. What are the specific situations or feelings that make you want to quit? Once you know your triggers, you can develop strategies for coping with them. Maybe it's having a pre-planned pep talk ready, or reaching out to your partner for support.

Also, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Acknowledge that you're breaking a cycle and that takes serious strength. Be kind to yourself when you slip up – it's part of the process. Just get back on track as soon as you can. You've got this!

t3_xc1fsf,[Need advice] Scared of making any attempt so I procrastinate,"So, what I’ve noticed is that I get very scared to do anything with studying or homework. 
I just get scared to even make an attempt at things… 

Usually, when it’s the day something is due, that fear of getting a bad grade overcomes that fear of making an attempt at doing things. 
It’s struggle though, and I end up hurting a lot. 

I’m just wondering about how I can just do things with school even if there is no due date to scare me into trying even though I get so afraid to (because I want to get things done earlier and not last second) 

I just don’t know how to get over that fear of doing anything at all, of even making an attempt…..

It’s not that I just want to play games or do something else, it’s just fear of doing it at all…..","I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.

In my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams 

Firstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% 

So whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. 

If you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. 

Now you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. 

Good luck bro , you can do it.","Pretend you are playing an acting role, or are controlling a robot, and your character/bot puppet is studying or doing whatever project. They are miserable, but getting on with it, putting in a C+ effort.
__
Sometimes making it a weird game like this works for me, or at least just accepting it's going to be miserable at first like like jumping in a cold pool, or telling myself giving 75% of my best effort is fine. Usually end up  going beyond that after getting into the groove of it.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of thinking about the entire assignment, focus on just starting with the first step, like reading the instructions or gathering your materials. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. 

Another strategy is to set a timer for a short period, like 10 or 15 minutes, and commit to working for just that amount of time. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going. Also, try to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or not be perfect on the first try. The important thing is to start and learn from the process. 

Lastly, consider rewarding yourself for completing tasks, even the small ones. This can help create a positive association with getting things done. You've got this!","What you're describing sounds like paralysis by analysis - getting so caught up in worry about potential outcomes that you can't take the first step. Here's what's helped others break through this:

Start ridiculously small. Instead of thinking ""I need to complete this whole assignment,"" tell yourself ""I'm just going to open the textbook and read one paragraph."" Or ""I'll just write one sentence."" Make it so easy that the fear can't get a grip on you.

The 5-minute rule can be really powerful here. Commit to working on something for just 5 minutes. After that, you can stop if you want to. What usually happens is that once you start, you'll often want to continue since the hardest part - getting started - is over.

Another technique is to reframe the task. Instead of seeing it as something you need to do perfectly, view it as an experiment or practice run. You're not committing to a final product, you're just exploring and learning. This takes some pressure off.

Remember that doing something imperfectly is infinitely better than doing nothing at all. Every attempt, even if it doesn't turn out great, teaches you something and builds your confidence for next time.

Try setting up a reward system for starting tasks early. Maybe after working on an assignment ahead of schedule, you get to do something you enjoy. This helps create positive associations instead of just responding to deadline pressure.

The key is to make starting feel safe and low-stakes. Once you build momentum with small wins, the fear will gradually lose its power over you.","It sounds like you're struggling with a deep-seated fear of starting tasks, especially when it comes to studying and homework. One strategy that might help is to break down your tasks into incredibly small, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to study for this entire subject,"" try telling yourself ""I'm going to open my textbook and read one page."" That's it, just one page. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've begun, you'll find it easier to keep going. Additionally, try to focus on the process, not the outcome. Instead of worrying about getting a bad grade, remind yourself that you're taking small steps towards learning and improving. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, and reward yourself when you reach them. This can help build confidence and make it feel less daunting to start tasks. Remember, it's okay to feel scared, but don't let that fear hold you back from making progress. You got this, and it's worth taking it one small step at a time.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of being paralyzed by fear when facing tasks, especially schoolwork. It's like the fear of failure is worse than the actual work itself.

One thing that might help is breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Seriously, so small they seem silly. Instead of ""study for history,"" it's ""open the history book."" That's it. Then, if you feel up to it, ""read one paragraph."" The point is to make the initial hurdle so low that you can't possibly fail. This can help you build momentum and reduce that initial fear.

Another thing to consider is focusing on the process, not the outcome. Instead of thinking about the grade you'll get, think about how much time you'll spend studying. Set a timer for 25 minutes (Pomodoro Technique) and tell yourself you'll just focus for that amount of time. No pressure to ace anything, just focus for 25 minutes. When the timer goes off, take a break.

Also, be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel scared. Acknowledge the fear, but don't let it control you. Maybe even try writing down what you're afraid of. Sometimes just getting it out of your head can make it less powerful. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13d7kef,[Need Advice] I'm 13 with a minor self-harm habit. (Explanation below.) How do I stop?,"I'm 13 with a habit of scratching my face. I don't have bad acne, I don't have noticable zits or pimples, I don't have itchiness. I scratch unconsciously at my face while I read, game, eat, write. 

It's to the point where I can go to the mirror every hour and see at least one new open wound, glistening red and seeping liquid. Coagulated blood's under my fingernails. I wear a KN95 mask just to hide the scars and wounds and say it's because of COVID.

My family scolds me over and over about this issue of mine, to no avail. I still scratch. There are scars up to a year and a half old.

https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/neurosciences-articles/excoriation-disorder-when-scratching-becomes-more-than-a-nervous-habit

Looks like excoriation disorder is similar to OCD.  It should be treatable, but it will probably cost some money to get proper treatment.  Look into the low cost options. There is a lot more focus on providing youth with mental health care, so you may find something.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for help—recognizing the issue is a big step. Here are a few things you might try to help break this habit:

1. **Awareness**: Try to become more aware of when you're scratching. You could keep a small journal or use a notes app to jot down when you notice yourself doing it. This might help you identify patterns or triggers.

2. **Substitute Habit**: Find something else to do with your hands. Stress balls, fidget spinners, or even a small piece of fabric to fiddle with can keep your hands busy and away from your face.

3. **Mindfulness**: Practice being present in the moment. Techniques like deep breathing or meditation can help you become more aware of your actions and reduce the urge to scratch.

4. **Physical Barriers**: Wearing gloves or band-aids on your fingers can serve as a physical reminder not to scratch. It might feel a bit odd at first, but it can be effective.

5. **Talk to Someone**: If you haven't already, consider talking to a trusted adult or counselor about this. They can offer support and might have additional strategies to help you.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and you're not alone in this. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself. Change takes time, but you can do it!","Hey there - what you're describing sounds like dermatillomania/excoriation disorder, which is a real condition that many people deal with. The good news is there are proven ways to manage this!

First, try keeping your hands busy. Get a fidget toy, stress ball, or silly putty to occupy your hands while reading/gaming. Some people find success with wearing thin cotton gloves when alone, making it physically harder to scratch.

For immediate help, keep your nails trimmed very short and file them smooth. Put bandaids on spots you frequently scratch to create a physical barrier. You can also try putting Vaseline on vulnerable areas - it makes scratching less satisfying and helps healing.

The key is replacing the scratching with a different habit. When you catch yourself about to scratch, immediately do your replacement activity instead. It could be squeezing a stress ball, doing a quick hand exercise, or even just clasping your hands together. Be patient - it takes time for new habits to stick.

Consider talking to your doctor or school counselor about this. They can connect you with resources and strategies specifically for managing excoriation. You're not alone in dealing with this, and it's great that you're taking steps to address it at a young age.

Remember - change happens gradually. Focus on progress, not perfection. Even reducing the frequency of scratching is a win. You've got this!","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and seek help for something like this, so kudos to you for taking the first step. It's great that you're recognizing the impact this habit is having on your health and wanting to make a change. 

One thing that might help is to become more aware of when you're scratching. Since you mentioned it's an unconscious habit, trying to catch yourself in the act can be really helpful. You could try setting reminders throughout the day to take a few deep breaths and check in with your body - are your hands on your face? Are your fingers twitching to scratch? 

Another strategy is to find alternative things to do with your hands when you're reading, gaming, or eating. This could be as simple as holding a stress ball, playing with a fidget toy, or even just keeping your hands busy with a small task like doodling or tapping on a surface. 

It might also be helpful to talk to a trusted adult - not necessarily your family members who have been scolding you, but maybe a school counselor or another relative - about what's going on and how you're feeling. They may be able to offer some additional support or guidance that can help you work through this habit. 

Lastly, consider keeping a journal or log of when you scratch and what might have triggered it. Was it stress? Boredom? Something else? Identifying patterns can help you develop strategies to avoid or cope with those triggers in healthier ways. 

Remember, breaking a habit takes time and patience, so be gentle with yourself and don't get discouraged if you slip up. You're taking the first steps towards making a positive change, and that's something to be proud of.","Hey, I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It takes a lot of courage to talk about self-harm, even minor forms. The fact that you recognize it's a problem and want to stop is a huge first step.

Since you're doing it unconsciously, you need to bring it to your conscious awareness. Here are a few things that might help:

*   **Awareness is key:** Try keeping a journal specifically to track when you scratch. Note the time, what you were doing, and how you were feeling right before. This can help you identify triggers.
*   **Replacement behaviors:** When you catch yourself scratching, immediately replace it with something else. Fidget toys, stress balls, or even just making a fist can give your hands something to do.
*   **Barriers:** Since you're scratching your face, maybe try wearing soft gloves while you're reading, gaming, or writing. It'll make it harder to scratch without noticing.
*   **Positive reinforcement:** Reward yourself for days you don't scratch. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something you enjoy.
*   **Professional help:** This is a tough one to tackle alone. Talking to a therapist or counselor could give you tools and strategies tailored to your specific situation. Many schools have counselors available, and there are also online options.

It's going to take time and effort, and you'll probably slip up sometimes. Don't get discouraged! Just keep trying, and remember that you're not alone in this. Be patient and kind to yourself. You got this.

t3_y3kxaz,[Need Advice] Struggling Working from Home,"I'm an engineer at a salaried job where not much is expected of me. I have deadlines to meet every 3 weeks. I have about 30 hours worth of work to do over the course of those 3 weeks whenever I want. This is a HORRIBLE system for a procrastinator.

I literally do nothing for 2.5 weeks. I ride bikes/train 15 hours a week, I play video games, I play chess, I watch youtube, I watch netflix. Anything except work. The dread of the deadline is always hanging over me. I hate the office work so much and it brings on an incredible amount stress when I'm trying to complete a 30 hour report in 2 days.

I travel 25% for this job and travel weeks are 40 to 60 hour work weeks. I find that to be so much more satisfying and less stressful. The travel is one of the few reasons I haven't left yet. It's crazy that I enjoy working 60 hours a week, living out of a hotel, more than working 10 hours a week from home.

I wake up everyday and I have an easy list of work things I want to complete that day. Every night I go to bed completing none of it and the stress continues to build for the next day. Then miraculously when I know I have no more time, I find the energy to work two 15 hour work days in a row. I seriously need help. I can't live like this anymore.","I have a spreadsheet, which has all of the tasks I need to do for a project and percentages next to each task. It tells me what area is the least completed, and I go straight to that task and do it until I’m bored. Then I log my progress and get a little shot of joy from seeing the grand total creep up by 1%. You can play mind games with yourself, like “first I’m going increase the overall percent by 5% then go for a walk, then nail 2%.”","I was let go from my job this morning for this exact reason. Admittedly, I reached the point where I was falling so far behind that I wasn't able to keep up, even with huge bursts of productivity. My boss said that I had not been consistent with my work or communication and that I did not give the impression that work was a priority for me. 

I had seen it coming for a while now, and yet I could not will myself to sit down and catch up enough. I was stressed first from the work, then from my procrastination, and finally from the social anxiety of not wanting to face my failure.

But when I finally got the call and was terminated, I honestly just felt relieved. I knew I was burnt out and feeling isolated, and I knew that it was affecting my work ethic as well as my mental health. I think it is also a wake up call for me, and maybe I am just someone who needs to be in office in order to focus. No shame in that, everyone is different. I love the idea of wfh and wish I could have made it work, but I just lost all motivation.

Sorry I do not have advice, just here to let you know that you are not alone.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help you manage your time better and reduce that last-minute stress:

1. **Break it Down**: Try breaking your 30-hour workload into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the entire report, focus on completing a small section each day. This can make the work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

2. **Set a Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes dedicated work hours. Even if it's just a couple of hours each day, having a set time to focus on work can help you build a habit and reduce procrastination.

3. **Use Timers**: Consider using the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make the work feel less daunting.

4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself small rewards for completing tasks. It could be as simple as a coffee break or a quick game. This can help motivate you to get started and keep going.

5. **Reflect on Travel Weeks**: Since you find travel weeks more satisfying, try to identify what aspects of those weeks make you more productive. Is it the structure, the change of environment, or something else? See if you can incorporate some of those elements into your home routine.

Remember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!","Your situation with work-from-home procrastination is actually pretty common, especially with flexible deadlines. The good news is that you already know you work well under different conditions (like during travel weeks), which gives us some clues about what might help.

First, try recreating some of that ""travel week structure"" at home. Set specific work hours and treat them like you would if you were at a client site. Getting dressed for work and having a dedicated workspace can help shift your mindset from ""home mode"" to ""work mode.""

Since you're clearly capable of intense focus (those 15-hour crunch days prove that), consider using the Pomodoro Technique. Start with just 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. Even one or two ""pomodoros"" a day is better than nothing, and you'll likely find yourself wanting to do more once you start.

Break down that 30 hours of work into smaller daily chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have 30 hours to do whenever,"" schedule specific tasks for specific days. Make them non-negotiable appointments with yourself, just like you would treat client meetings during travel weeks.

You might also benefit from body-doubling - working alongside someone else, even virtually. There are online co-working spaces and Discord channels where people work together silently. This can help recreate that sense of accountability you feel when working on-site.

Remember, you don't have to transform everything overnight. Start with small changes - maybe commit to working just 2 hours each morning before allowing yourself to bike or play chess. Build from there. The goal is to spread that work out so you can actually enjoy your free time without the constant dread of looming deadlines.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common problem known as ""time inconsistency"" - you prioritize short-term leisure over long-term goals, even when it leads to more stress and discomfort in the end. One strategy that might help is to break down your 30 hours of work into smaller, manageable chunks, and schedule them into your calendar just like you would any other non-negotiable appointment. This could be as simple as committing to work 2-3 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or whatever schedule works best for you.

Additionally, you might consider implementing some ""implementation intentions"" - specific plans for when and where you will work on your tasks. For example, ""If it's Monday at 9am, then I will work on my report for 2 hours."" This can help make your goals feel more concrete and achievable.

It's also interesting that you mention enjoying your travel weeks more than working from home, despite the longer hours. This might suggest that having a structured schedule and clear deadlines can actually be helpful for you, even if it feels restrictive at first. You could try to replicate some of that structure while working from home, by setting clear goals and deadlines for yourself, and establishing a dedicated workspace that helps you get into ""work mode"".

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - completing a single task or making progress on your report can give you a sense of momentum and motivation that can carry over into the next day. Try to focus on making progress, rather than being perfect, and see if that helps you build some discipline and consistency into your work routine.","Hey, I totally get the struggle. That ""freedom"" can be a real trap sometimes. It sounds like you're not lacking the ability to work hard, just the structure to do it consistently at home.

Here's a thought: since you enjoy the travel weeks, try to mimic that structure at home. Could you create a ""travel day"" routine even when you're not traveling? Maybe that means waking up at the same time, getting dressed as if you were going to the office (even if it's just nicer sweats!), and designating a specific workspace that's only for work.

Also, break down that 30-hour report into much smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of ""work on report,"" try ""write the introduction"" or ""find three sources."" Make those tasks so small you can't say no to them. Even 15 minutes of focused work is better than zero.

Finally, consider timeboxing. Allocate specific blocks of time for work, even if it's just an hour or two each day. Set a timer, and when it goes off, you're done for that block. This can help you avoid burnout and build momentum. Good luck, you got this!

t3_po5zki,[Need Advice] I've spent 3+ years saying I'll start tomorrow,"I'm exhausted with myself. I lack any sort of motivation to do anything anymore and everyday it seems to get worse. I truly feel I have mentally hit rock bottom. I've slowly gone down hill over the past few years, but when the pandemic hit I really lost myself. I stopped doing any sort of self care or dressing in anything but sweatpants. I left my extremely toxic job in March and have bounced around dead end jobs since then. The only positive thing I have done for myself recently was to go back to school - but even that is challenging. (It is only week 2 and I already missed a class because I woke up with a migraine and just felt extremely lethargic) I have become the Queen of excuses and I can't stand myself anymore. I woke up today so done with this lifestyle and would just really like some guidance and advice on how to start doing better for myself (for my dogs and relationship as well since they all suffer having to deal with my lazy depressed ass... but stick by my side as unfair as it is) I smoke a lot of weed, and as hard as it is going to be I think that needs to be one of the first things to change. I'm 31 and have so much life left to live, but it's not going to happen if I keep saying 'I'll do it tomorrow' - I feel like I've already wasted much time and it's time to be held accountable and really try. I'm waving the white flag and open to any and all suggestions, advice, routines, mantras or whatever has worked for all of you.","I would recommend reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, there's a sub reddit called leaves I would also suggest checking that out and last but not least, try to make everyday 1% better than the last, improvement takes time, 1% a day for a month is nearly a third and that's a big improvement (something I picked up in James clears book)",I actually just stepped outside and cleaned the windows on my car - something I’ve been wanting to do for over a month & it got me outside. Going to take it to the car wash once I’m done!,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. That’s a big step in itself. It sounds like you’re ready to take control, and that’s awesome. Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Start Small**: It’s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one small habit to change first. Maybe it’s reducing your weed intake or setting a consistent wake-up time. Small wins build momentum.

2. **Routine is Key**: Try to establish a simple daily routine. It doesn’t have to be rigid, but having a structure can help you feel more in control. Even just getting dressed in something other than sweatpants can make a difference in how you feel.

3. **Accountability**: Since you mentioned wanting to be held accountable, consider finding a buddy or a community (like this one!) to check in with. Sometimes just knowing someone else is rooting for you can be motivating.

4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that change is a process. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

5. **Professional Help**: If you’re feeling really stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation.

Remember, it’s okay to have off days. What matters is that you keep trying. You’ve got this!","First off - recognizing you want to change and asking for help is a huge step. You're not alone in this struggle, and it's never too late to start building better habits.

Starting with the weed - you're right that this needs to be addressed. Cannabis can seriously impact motivation and make everything feel more difficult than it needs to be. Consider checking out r/leaves for support in cutting back or quitting.

Here's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start incredibly small. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once. Pick ONE tiny habit to build first - something so easy it feels almost ridiculous. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, or drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or putting on real clothes instead of sweats.

The key is consistency over intensity. Do that one small thing every single day for two weeks. Don't worry about anything else yet. Once that becomes automatic, add one more small habit. 

For school specifically - set up your class materials the night before. Put everything by the door. Make it as brain-dead simple as possible to get to class, because when you're struggling with motivation, every tiny obstacle becomes a mountain.

You mentioned being exhausted with yourself - use that energy. Instead of beating yourself up about the past 3 years, channel that frustration into doing one small positive thing RIGHT NOW. Not tomorrow. Today. Even if it's just a 5-minute walk around the block or sending one job application.

Remember: Progress isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days. The goal isn't perfection - it's just doing slightly better than yesterday. Keep showing up, keep trying, and those small consistent actions will compound over time.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we're not doing well and want to make a change, so kudos to you for recognizing that and seeking help. It's great that you've identified some areas you'd like to work on, such as quitting weed and establishing a self-care routine. Starting small can be really helpful - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, try picking one or two things you'd like to focus on and build from there. For example, you could start by setting a goal to get dressed in something other than sweatpants every morning, or to take a short walk with your dogs each day. Having a routine can be really helpful for building momentum and motivation, so you might consider creating a schedule for yourself that includes time blocks for school, self-care, and relaxation. It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have setbacks - missing one class doesn't mean you're failing, and it's great that you're taking steps to get back on track. Remember that developing discipline and new habits takes time, and it's not always easy, but it sounds like you're ready to put in the work and make some positive changes in your life. What do you think would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take today to start moving in a more positive direction?","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and ready to make a change is huge. Seriously, that's the first and hardest step.

First, be kind to yourself. You've been through a lot, and it's okay to not be perfect. Don't beat yourself up for past ""failures,"" just focus on moving forward.

Since you mentioned weed, tackling that is a great starting point. Maybe don't try to quit cold turkey right away. Instead, try gradually reducing your intake. Set small, achievable goals each day or week. There are also subreddits dedicated to quitting weed that could offer support.

For the general lack of motivation, start ridiculously small. Like, *really* small. Instead of ""I'm going to work out for an hour,"" try ""I'm going to put on my workout clothes."" Or instead of ""I'm going to write a chapter of my paper,"" try ""I'm going to open my laptop and look at the document."" The point is to make the initial step so easy that you can't say no. Once you've done that small thing, you'll often find it easier to keep going.

Also, schedule things, even small things. Put ""take a shower"" or ""walk the dogs for 10 minutes"" on your calendar. Seeing it written down can make it feel more real and less optional.

Finally, remember why you want to change. You mentioned your dogs and your relationship. Keep them in mind when you're struggling. Visualizing the positive impact your actions will have on them (and yourself!) can be a powerful motivator. You got this!

t3_t9ww1o,[Need Advice] Getting disciplined is making me miserable,"I (27f) have struggled creating and maintaining healthy habits my whole life. I used to pretend that living a healthy lifestyle wasn't necessary but as I got older I gained weight and developed GERD as a result of the weight and decided it was time to make a change and failed many many times. I only need to lose about 25 pounds but its been tough. For context I also work a semi stressful job that usually leaves me feeling emotionally drained by the end of the workday. 

Recently I read Atomic Habits, and it really helped me set small goals that I've been very consistent with. The issue is that I feel like im losing all the things that made me happy and I just feel miserable despite making good progress on my goals. I love going out for food and I enjoy having some wine after work and with dinner to wind down. My new routine doesn't really allow for these things as I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit. I still allow myself to have these things but in moderation, so think twice a week or so. 

When I resist the temptation to go out for food or get alcohol I don't feel happy about it, I just feel annoyed that I cant do the thing that makes me happy. When I cave and do these things anyways I feel happy in the moment but then feel bad about it after. Being in a caloric deficit also make tired and cranky overall so most days after work I just feel tired and drained and I don't feel like I even enjoy my hobbies anymore.

Is this a normal adjustment to a new routine? Will it go away eventually? All I know is I don't feel happy with my health and body when I do nothing to improve my situation but I also don't feel happy right now restricting myself from the things that make me happy. Any advice would be appreciated.","It’s not fun waking up 5 am to go to gym before work.

It’s not fun ordering a salad when all your friends are enjoying pizza and wings 

It’s not fun going to sleep at 9 when your favorite show comes on at 10 but you know your body needs 8 hrs of sleep. 

It’s not fun saying no to a social gathering because you made a budget and going will put you over it. 


But it is fun when you go to the beach and have 0 insecurities because you diet and exercise.

It is fun when you can go to Jamaica in the summer because you budgeted well all year and have a few extra grand laying around in the summer. 

It is fun when you get the promotion because your fit and sleep 8 hrs a day and work circles around your coworkers effortlessly. 

Sacrifice the small pleasures now and you’ll have much bigger ones later.",Your answer made my day. Thanks!,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're making progress with your goals. It's normal to feel a bit off when you're adjusting to a new routine, especially when it involves cutting back on things you enjoy. Here are a few things you might consider:

1. **Balance and Flexibility**: It's important to find a balance that allows you to enjoy life while still working towards your goals. Maybe try incorporating small treats more frequently but in smaller portions, so you don't feel deprived.

2. **Mindful Indulgence**: When you do indulge, try to be fully present and enjoy it without guilt. This can help you feel more satisfied and less likely to overindulge later.

3. **Energy Levels**: If you're feeling tired and cranky, it might be worth looking at your overall nutrition. Sometimes a small tweak, like adding more protein or fiber, can help with energy levels.

4. **Stress Management**: Since your job is stressful, finding non-food ways to unwind could be beneficial. Maybe try a short walk, meditation, or a hobby that doesn't feel like a chore.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge the progress you've made, no matter how small. This can help keep you motivated and remind you why you started.

Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to adjust your approach as you go. You're doing great by being consistent and seeking ways to improve. Keep it up!","What you're experiencing is a really common challenge when building new habits - the adjustment period can feel pretty rough, especially when the old habits were genuine sources of pleasure. The good news is that this difficult phase usually does get easier with time as your body and mind adapt.

Instead of viewing this as permanently giving up things you enjoy, try reframing it as finding new ways to get similar satisfaction. For example, you could experiment with making restaurant-quality meals at home (which lets you control portions and ingredients while still being a treat), or discover non-alcoholic ways to decompress after work like a fancy tea ritual or sparkling water mocktails.

For the tiredness from the caloric deficit - make sure you're not cutting calories too aggressively. A smaller deficit of 300-400 calories is often more sustainable than a larger one, even if progress is slower. Also consider timing your meals so you have more energy when you need it most.

The key is finding sustainable changes you can live with long-term, not white-knuckling through restriction. Maybe that means having a nice dinner out once a week rather than cutting it completely, or finding ways to make your current meals more satisfying while staying within your goals.

Your progress with Atomic Habits is already impressive - now it's about fine-tuning things so they work better for your lifestyle. Focus on building new sources of enjoyment rather than just removing old ones. Over time, you may find yourself naturally preferring these new habits as they become part of who you are.","It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge many people face when trying to build new habits - the feeling of deprivation and restriction. First, kudos to you for making progress on your goals and being consistent with your small habits. That's a huge accomplishment, especially given your history with struggling to create healthy habits.

One thing to consider is that it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around your new routine. Instead of focusing on what you're giving up, try to focus on what you're gaining - more energy, better health, and a sense of accomplishment. It's also important to remember that it's okay to indulge every now and then, and it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach.

You might want to experiment with finding healthier alternatives to your favorite activities, like trying new recipes at home or finding low-calorie wine options. This way, you can still enjoy the things that bring you happiness without feeling like you're completely depriving yourself.

It's also worth considering whether your calorie deficit is too aggressive. Being in a calorie deficit can be tough, especially when combined with a stressful job and emotional exhaustion. You might want to talk to a nutritionist or a healthcare professional to see if there's a way to adjust your diet to make it more sustainable and less draining.

Lastly, don't forget to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy, even if they're not directly related to your health goals. Whether it's reading, taking a relaxing bath, or practicing yoga, making time for these activities can help you feel more balanced and happy overall. Remember, discipline is not about sacrificing happiness, but about finding a sustainable balance that works for you in the long term.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really common experience when trying to change habits. It's great that Atomic Habits helped you get consistent, but it's also important to find a balance so you don't feel deprived.

It's totally normal to feel a bit miserable when you're restricting things you enjoy. Think of it less as restriction and more as mindful enjoyment. Instead of ""I can't have this,"" try ""I'm choosing to have this less often so I can enjoy it more fully when I do.""

Maybe instead of completely cutting out wine, you could try a smaller glass or a lighter wine. For eating out, could you focus on healthier options at restaurants you love, or maybe cook more at home but recreate your favorite restaurant dishes? The goal is to find sustainable swaps, not total deprivation.

Also, don't underestimate the power of finding new, healthy things you enjoy. Experiment with different types of exercise until you find something that actually makes you feel good. Explore new hobbies that can help you unwind after work without relying on food or alcohol.

It's also worth checking if your calorie deficit is too aggressive. Feeling constantly tired and cranky might mean you're cutting calories too drastically. A smaller deficit might be more sustainable in the long run, even if it means slower progress.

Give it time, and keep tweaking your approach until you find a balance that works for you. It's a marathon, not a sprint!

t3_125e8y1,"[NEED ADVICE] how do I balance work, studies and sleep?","I managed to land a wfh job with decent hours. Hours are roughly from 9 am - 7-8 pm. It’s insane how sleepy I feel - at 11 AM, after lunch, then again at 9 PM. How am I even alive? How do I function? I stop caring about things when I feel sleepy. 
Please advise.","Youre working long hours. You're working 50-55h a week. Most people are going to feel sleepy from that. Some people will adapt, others wont. There is no magic formula except getting enough sleep and good nutrition",I would advise against studying before shortly before you head to bed. It's proven that your brain doesn't retain as much information and has a hard time remembering what you read/studied. So for the 1 hour you study before heading to bed its actually like 40 minutes of studying time.,"Balancing work, studies, and sleep can definitely be a challenge, but with a few adjustments, you can make it more manageable. First, try to establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve your sleep quality. Also, consider incorporating short power naps (10-20 minutes) during your breaks if possible, as they can help boost your energy levels without affecting your nighttime sleep. 

For your work and study sessions, use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain your focus and prevent burnout. Lastly, pay attention to your diet and hydration; sometimes, sleepiness can be linked to what you eat or drink. Try to have balanced meals and stay hydrated throughout the day. Small changes can make a big difference, so experiment with what works best for you!","Those sleepy periods you're experiencing are actually pretty normal - they align with our natural circadian rhythms. The key is working with your body's patterns rather than fighting them.

First, let's optimize your sleep. With those work hours, you'll want to be in bed by 10:30-11pm to get adequate rest before your 9am start. Create a wind-down routine starting an hour before bed - dim lights, avoid screens, maybe do some light stretching.

For managing daytime drowsiness: Get some movement in the morning before work, even just 10 minutes of stretching or a quick walk. When you feel that 11am slump coming, stand up and move around for 5 minutes. During lunch, try to get outside for 15 minutes - natural light helps regulate your energy levels.

The post-lunch crash around 2-3pm is super common. Keep your lunch moderate in size and low in simple carbs. Have healthy snacks ready (nuts, fruit) for when energy dips. Stay hydrated throughout the day too - dehydration makes fatigue worse.

For the evening slump, try changing tasks or taking a 5-minute break to do some jumping jacks or wall pushups. The physical movement can help push through until you finish work.

Start implementing these changes gradually - maybe focus on sleep schedule first, then add the other elements over time. Your body will adjust to the routine with consistency.","It sounds like you're struggling with a pretty demanding schedule and some fatigue issues. First, congrats on the new job - that's a great accomplishment. To balance work, studies, and sleep, let's break it down. With your work hours being 9 am - 7-8 pm, that's a long stretch. Have you considered taking short breaks throughout the day to refresh your mind and body? Even a 10-15 minute walk or some stretching exercises can help increase alertness. 

For your studies, try to allocate specific timeslots outside of work hours, maybe early morning or right after dinner, when you're most focused. As for sleep, establishing a consistent bedtime routine is key. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and create a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal your body that it's time to wind down. 

It might also be helpful to identify what's causing your sleepiness - is it the work itself, lack of physical activity, or something else? Once you pinpoint the cause, you can start working on solutions. Lastly, don't worry if you feel like you're not functioning at 100% all the time; it's normal to have ups and downs. By making small adjustments to your daily routine and prioritizing self-care, you can find a better balance that works for you.","Hey, that sounds like a tough schedule! It's totally normal to feel exhausted with those hours. A few things that might help:

First, really dial in your sleep. Aim for a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, to regulate your body clock. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.

Second, look at your diet. Are you eating balanced meals with enough protein and complex carbs to sustain your energy throughout the day? Avoid sugary snacks that cause energy crashes.

Third, schedule short breaks during your workday. Even 5-10 minutes every hour to stand up, stretch, or walk around can make a big difference. Maybe try a quick power nap during your lunch break if you can.

Finally, consider light exercise. Even a short walk in the morning or evening can boost your energy levels and improve your sleep. Experiment and see what works best for you! Good luck, you got this!

t3_1420cej,[Need Advice] How do I safely Decrease my appetite?,"I typically eat a light breakfast, decent lunch, and decent dinner, but I'm basically always hungry after all meals. If I'm at a restaurant, I'll get A plate of food, finish off, and still not feel full or quite satisfied. I would like advice, if there is any to give, on finding a way to eat the same amounts I am, and feel satisfied or full for it. I don't need the advice for losing weight, I (M, 23) feel fine at ~180 lbs. The reason to want this change is budget related, where I'm getting into a situation where I can't always just buy snacks, or make more food. Google is surprisingly unhelpful, only offering weight loss solutions - and maybe that's not a bad idea, but not what I'm looking for. I'd like suggestions on ways to feel fuller after a meal while eating the same (or less).

Maybe this gets asked a bunch,  but this is not a life-ending problem so if the post dies in new, no harm no foul.",Try to eat more greens and healthy fats. I guarantee you can't finish off 500 kcal of salad,"No meat, no dressing, and rember: no russian","Hey there! It sounds like you're looking for ways to feel more satisfied with your meals without increasing your food budget. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Focus on Protein and Fiber**: These nutrients can help you feel fuller for longer. Try incorporating more beans, lentils, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or tofu into your meals.

2. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day, and try having a glass before meals to help with satiety.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Slow down and really savor your food. Eating more slowly can give your body time to register fullness. Try putting your fork down between bites or chewing more thoroughly.

4. **Volume Eating**: Add more low-calorie, high-volume foods like vegetables to your meals. They can bulk up your plate and help you feel more satisfied without adding a lot of calories.

5. **Healthy Fats**: Including a small amount of healthy fats like avocado, nuts, or olive oil can also help with satiety.

Remember, it's all about finding what works for you and your lifestyle. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you feel more satisfied with your meals!","There are several effective ways to feel more satisfied while eating the same amount or less. First, try eating more protein-rich foods and fiber in your meals - these help with satiety much more than simple carbs. Add eggs to breakfast, lean meats to lunch/dinner, and include vegetables with every meal.

Drinking water before and during meals can help too. Sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger. A glass of water 15-20 minutes before eating can make a real difference.

The speed at which you eat matters a lot. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness signals. Try putting your fork down between bites and chewing thoroughly. This gives your body time to recognize it's getting full.

Consider the composition of your meals too. Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados, nuts, olive oil) can help you feel fuller longer. Complex carbs like brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes are more filling than their refined counterparts.

Lastly, mindful eating helps - no TV or phone while eating. Focus on your food and you'll likely feel more satisfied with your portions. These aren't quick fixes, but implementing even a couple of these strategies should help you feel more satisfied without increasing portion sizes or food costs.","It sounds like you're looking to increase satiety without necessarily changing your overall diet or calorie intake. One thing you might consider is focusing on more filling foods, such as those high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. These nutrients tend to be more satisfying and can help keep you feeling fuller for longer. For example, adding some nuts or seeds to your meals, or incorporating more lean proteins like chicken or fish, could make a difference. Additionally, drinking water before and during meals can also help with feelings of fullness. Another strategy is to slow down while eating and pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues - sometimes our brains can take a bit to catch up with our stomachs, so giving yourself time to feel satisfied can be helpful. You might also experiment with different spices and seasonings to make your meals more flavorful, which can help you feel more satisfied with the same amount of food. Lastly, considering your budget constraints, planning your meals and snacks in advance could help you make the most of what you have and reduce the need for extra purchases. Have you tried any of these approaches or is there something specific that's holding you back from feeling full after meals?","Hey, I get where you're coming from. Feeling hungry all the time when you're trying to budget sucks. It's definitely doable to feel fuller without drastically changing your diet or aiming for weight loss.

A couple of things to try: First, focus on fiber and protein. These take longer to digest and can really help with satiety. Think about adding a side of beans to your lunch or dinner, or maybe swapping white bread for whole wheat. Even a handful of nuts as a snack could make a difference.

Second, water is your friend. Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water before your meals and see if that helps curb your appetite. Also, make sure you're drinking enough throughout the day.

Third, mindful eating can be surprisingly effective. Slow down, put your fork down between bites, and really focus on the taste and texture of your food. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to register that you're full, so eating slower gives it a chance to catch up.

Finally, consider the volume of your food. You can increase the volume of your meals without adding a ton of calories by incorporating things like leafy greens or broth-based soups. A big salad before your main course could help you feel more satisfied with a smaller portion of the main dish. Good luck!

I find myself procrastinating with everything. I feel guilt not doing the things I know I need too, but the issue is with the productivity level I’m at, I can skim by forever. I want to do more but every time I think about the all the things I want to get done, I get overwhelmed and do none of them. 

Where do I start? How do you just build a different mindset? Is this the right subreddit for this post? 

Someone help please!
Ty","I am right there with you fighting the same battle. The only things helping me move forward (slowly) are these 3 things:
1. I deleted all social media beside Reddit. No Tik Tok, no Instagram, no Facebook- nothing that will allow me to mindlessly scroll. It has actually caused me to pick up a book and read. 
2. When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself “What is something small I can do right now?”. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick. No, I’m not going to finish prepping for a big work meeting all in 1 go, but I have at least get the background slides done. These small wins make me feel like I am doing something. 
3. This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud “Don’t put it down- put it away.” This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. 

Maybe these will help you move forward. It’s a small start.

Also, the book Atomic Habits is slowly but surely changing my life and making even these tiny gains happen. I recommend running to get it. Before I started to read it, I wondered if maybe I was depressed. And truthfully, maybe I still am. But this book is helping me realize that it is not a lack of goals or motivation that is my problem, it is a lack of good systems in my life. Maybe the book and those 3 starters can help you begin building up your systems too. Sending good thoughts your way!","I'm about to do the reverse, reddit got to go it's mindless scrolling for me, even the ""news"" is filled with mindless drama and banter.

At least with facebook it's real friends and Instagram it's my buddy's posting things about there life I can relate too.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but the good news is that you're already taking the first step by reaching out for advice. Here's a simple approach to get started: 

1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task that you can complete today. It could be as simple as making your bed or organizing your desk. The key is to build momentum with small wins.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time. Use a planner or an app to keep track of your tasks and prioritize them.

3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and leisure. Consistency is crucial in building discipline.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process.

This subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes. Keep pushing forward, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You've got this!","Hey there - this is definitely the right subreddit, and what you're describing is super common. The key is to start really small instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Pick ONE tiny task that takes 5 minutes or less. It could be making your bed, doing 5 pushups, or reading one page of a book. Do just that one thing consistently for a week. Don't worry about anything else on your to-do list right now.

The goal isn't the task itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on a commitment. Once that small habit feels automatic (usually takes 1-2 weeks), add another tiny task. 

This approach works because it:
1) Prevents the overwhelm that's currently paralyzing you
2) Builds momentum through small wins
3) Rewires your brain to associate action with positive feelings

Remember: You don't need motivation to act. Action creates motivation. Start ridiculously small, be consistent, and let the momentum build naturally.

What's one tiny task you could commit to doing tomorrow?","You're definitely in the right place here on r/getdisciplined. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge where you're at and want to make a change, so kudos to you for that first step. To start building a different mindset, I'd recommend beginning with small, manageable tasks that you can accomplish daily. This will help you build momentum and confidence. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try breaking down your goals into tiny, bite-sized chunks. For example, if you want to start exercising, commit to doing just 5-10 minutes of stretching or a short walk each day. As you consistently complete these small tasks, you'll start to develop a sense of discipline and productivity that can then be applied to larger goals. It's also important to set clear priorities and focus on one task at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by your entire to-do list. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You got this, and we're all here to support you.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of being stuck. It's super common! The ""overwhelmed and do none of them"" part is key. You're trying to tackle too much at once.

Here's my advice: start ridiculously small. Seriously. Pick ONE thing you want to do, and make the goal laughably easy. Like, if you want to read more, aim for reading just one page a day. If you want to exercise, do 5 minutes of stretching. The point isn't the accomplishment itself, it's building the habit of *starting*.

Once you've consistently done that tiny thing for a week or two, *then* you can gradually increase it. The momentum will surprise you.

As for mindset, it's less about a sudden shift and more about consistent action. Each small win builds confidence and makes the next step easier. And yes, this is definitely the right subreddit for this! Good luck, you got this!

I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I’m just so disappointed in my self. It’s hard to drink water. I’m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I’m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I’m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I’m just mad at life. I’m not depressed I’m just disappointed. 

I’m a ball full of energy. I’m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I’m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I’m a caffeine addict. I don’t know how I will function without my meds when I’m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven’t even gotten my associates degree yet.

How do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don’t wanna do. I’m not disciplined. 

How do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don’t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can’t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I’m
Tired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it","Re: the meds part, why?  Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.

You wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what's wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?

That's how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol",Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That’s why you feel like you have no energy.  It’s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it’s worth it.,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:

1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.

2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.

4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.

5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.

Remember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","First off - you're not a failure. You have a job, you're in school, you take care of your appearance, and most importantly - you WANT to improve. That's a solid foundation to build from.

Let's tackle this step by step. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE small habit to master first. Since you mentioned feeling physically bad, let's start with water intake. Get a large water bottle and keep it with you always. Set specific times to drink - when you wake up, with meals, etc. Make it dead simple.

For the binge eating, especially on non-medication days, try planning your meals in advance. Prep healthy snacks and meals when you're on Vyvanse and feeling motivated. That way, when the harder days come, you just need to heat up what's already made. The goal isn't perfection - it's making the healthy choice slightly easier than the unhealthy one.

For productivity and focus, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Start with just one or two sessions per day. Your brain is like a muscle - you need to gradually build up its capacity for sustained focus. Don't expect to maintain the same productivity level off-medication as on it. Instead, adjust your expectations and create different routines for different days.

When you slip up (which everyone does), don't view it as starting over. Think of it like GPS recalculating - you're just finding a new route to the same destination. Keep a simple journal noting what triggers your binges or productivity dips. This info will help you adjust your strategy over time.

Remember: discipline isn't about being perfect every day. It's about showing up consistently and making slightly better choices over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on progress rather than perfection.","It sounds like you're really struggling with developing discipline and breaking free from some tough habits, especially when it comes to food and motivation. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing these patterns and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. 

Given your ADHD diagnosis and medication schedule, it might be helpful to focus on building small, manageable habits on your non-medication days. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start with tiny goals like drinking one extra glass of water or taking a short 10-minute walk. These tiny wins can add up and help you build momentum.

It's also important to address the binge eating and emotional relationship with food. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders - they can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues. 

In terms of rewiring your brain for discipline, it's not about being perfect, but about making progress. You might find it helpful to set clear, achievable goals for yourself, break them down into smaller tasks, and create an environment that supports those goals (e.g., removing tempting foods from your home, finding a workout buddy, etc.). 

Remember, discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it's okay if you don't see immediate results. It's about showing up every day, making small efforts, and being kind to yourself when you slip up. You're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you develop the habits and discipline you're looking for. Keep in mind that it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, but also that you're really motivated to make some changes, which is awesome. It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're juggling ADHD, binge eating, and everything else life throws at you.

First, be kind to yourself. You're already doing a lot – college, a job, taking care of yourself. That's not nothing! It's easy to get caught up in what you *aren't* doing, but try to acknowledge what you *are* accomplishing.

Regarding discipline, it's not about a complete brain reset. It's more like training a muscle. Start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's drinking more water. Set a realistic goal – like one extra glass a day – and build from there. When you've nailed that, add another small change.

For the food and phone cravings, try to identify your triggers. When do you usually reach for those things? Can you replace them with something else? Maybe a walk, a quick meditation, or even just a different app on your phone. There are apps that can help you limit your time on social media, which might be useful.

About your meds, have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling on and off them? Maybe there's a tweak that could help with the binge eating on your off days. It's also worth exploring therapy, especially for the binge eating disorder. A therapist can give you tools to manage those urges and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

As for staying focused, the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks) can be really helpful for ADHD. It breaks down tasks into manageable chunks and gives you built-in rewards.

Finally, remember that setbacks are normal. Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You've got this! Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way.

t3_u0xcin,[Need Advice] 23 year old female with a 6 figure software engineer job. Just bought a condo. New at my job and fortunately that let's me get away with barely doing any work but ... getting increasingly nervous that I can't perform.,"First thing first. Imposter syndrome is kicking my ass. I remind myself constantly that it's okay not know how to do things and ask a lot of questions, but I need so much hand holding. I feel so much panic. 

On top of that, I'm dealing with learning how to be a better person, friend and partner. And I have a place I'm getting in order. I get bursts of motivation but I feel like I am procrastinating so often. I know they're going to realize I am not doing shit and I am worried about my job. 

I used to be able to sit for hours and study math or make art. Maybe because I felt good at it? But I could figure things out and perfect things for so long but my patience and tolerance feels like it is at a 0. Any book recommendations? I want to feel good at what I do and put the work in. I just... don't know what to do. And the good therapist I finally found after many shitty ones has ghosted me and I don't want to go through the process again. I feel like I'm so close to an amazing life with a job that gives me freedom to do other things. But I feel like I'm drowning and I'm so unconfident in my job. I feel like I'll lose it and will be stripping again. Sometimes I fantasize about that because I am good at it and I feel in control there.","Congrulations for your Job! In my opinion small daily routines  gives best outcome. Waiting for inspiration, motivation  boom  generally not sustainable. I am also a software developer sometimes I cant help myself and giving up my tasks. But when i start daily fixed routine  i feel more organized and productive. I told my self first thing in the morning do some coding job Just for 5 minutes if dont like you can give up. I did this every day now i feel more productive. I can suggest meditation. It clears mind and atomic habits book.","As a 25 year old who's already studying for quite some time with a new job as ABAP developer I know exactly what it feels like. I'm scared of failing exams, imposter syndrome at work.

Since i'm working fully remote they cannot really track my working time nor progress. I'm not really getting my work done in a appropriate time...

But... I noticed that if I have any appointment (Uni, work, friends, sports) i'm much more reliable.

Maybe it is a good idea to find someone to have a work-meeting with for set times. So you see eachother working and can casually talk with about problems (and all software engineers know... we have A LOT of problems). I don't even mean a colleague from work. Just anyone! Maybe that is going to help you as well? :)","Hey there! First off, congrats on the new job and condo—those are huge achievements! It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed. Imposter syndrome is a tough beast, but remember, everyone starts somewhere, and asking questions is a sign of strength, not weakness.

To tackle the work anxiety, try setting small, achievable goals each day. This can help build confidence and show progress. Also, consider pairing up with a mentor or a more experienced colleague who can guide you through the learning curve. They can offer insights and reassurance that you're on the right track.

For your personal life, it might help to schedule regular check-ins with yourself. Reflect on what you want to improve and set realistic steps to get there. It’s okay to take it one day at a time.

As for book recommendations, ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is a great read on building habits and discipline. It might give you some practical strategies to regain that focus and patience you mentioned.

Lastly, don't give up on finding a therapist. It can be frustrating, but having someone to talk to can make a big difference. You're doing great, and it's clear you're committed to making positive changes. Keep pushing forward, and remember, it's okay to lean on others for support. You've got this!","Your situation is actually pretty common for new software engineers, especially those who've had quick success. The key is to shift from seeing this as an overwhelming challenge to treating it as a growth opportunity that you can tackle systematically.

Start by breaking down your work into smaller, manageable chunks. Pick one small task each day that you know you can complete, even if it seems trivial. This builds momentum and confidence. When you finish that task, document what you learned - this creates a personal knowledge base you can reference later.

For the focus issues: Set a timer for just 25 minutes of dedicated work. No distractions, just coding. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. You mentioned being able to focus on art and math before - this same ability is still there, it just needs to be rebuilt gradually.

Regarding the job anxiety: Instead of waiting to be ""found out,"" be proactive. Schedule regular check-ins with your lead/mentor. Come prepared with specific questions and areas where you need guidance. Most tech leads actually respect junior developers who are upfront about their learning needs.

For immediate reading, check out ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. It's perfect for rebuilding focus and discipline through small, consistent changes. ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" is also great for developing solid engineering practices.

Remember that your past success in math, art, and even your previous work shows you're capable of mastering complex skills. You've got this - it's just about building new patterns one small step at a time.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure and self-doubt right now, but first, let's acknowledge that you've already achieved some amazing things - landing a 6-figure job and buying a condo is no small feat. It's normal to feel overwhelmed when starting a new role, especially in a field like software engineering where there's always more to learn. 

One thing that might help with your imposter syndrome is to focus on the fact that you were hired for this job, which means your employers believe you have the potential to excel in it. It's okay to not know everything right away, and asking questions is a sign of strength, not weakness. As for procrastination, try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day or week. This can help you build momentum and confidence.

Regarding your motivation and patience, it's possible that you're just feeling burned out from all the changes in your life right now. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and prioritize self-care - whether that means taking a walk, practicing yoga, or simply doing something creative like art. You mentioned you used to be able to focus for hours on math or art, so try to tap back into that part of yourself.

As for book recommendations, ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey and ""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"" by Carol S. Dweck might be helpful in terms of building confidence and developing a growth mindset. Additionally, ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport could provide some useful strategies for overcoming procrastination and staying focused.

Lastly, don't give up on finding a good therapist - it's worth the effort to find someone who can support you through this challenging time. And try not to worry too much about losing your job - you've made it this far, and with time and practice, you'll become more confident in your abilities. Remember that everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","Hey, congrats on the job and the condo! It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, but it's awesome you're self-aware and want to improve.

First, imposter syndrome is super common, especially when starting a new job. Instead of focusing on what you *don't* know, try to track what you *are* learning each week. Even small things. Write them down. It'll help you see your progress and build confidence. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help, but try to frame your questions as ""I've tried X and Y, and I'm still stuck on Z. Any suggestions?"" This shows initiative.

For getting back into a productive groove, maybe start small. Instead of trying to sit for hours like you used to, aim for 25-minute focused sessions (Pomodoro Technique). Then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. It's easier to build momentum that way.

As for books, ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is a classic for building good habits and breaking bad ones. It's really practical and easy to implement. Also, maybe look into books on time management or productivity specifically for software engineers – there might be some tailored advice out there.

Finding a new therapist sucks, but don't give up. In the meantime, are there any friends or family members you can confide in? Sometimes just talking things out can help.

Finally, remember that it's okay to not be perfect. You're 23, you're learning, and you're doing great things. Focus on small, consistent improvements, and you'll get there. You got this!

I'm 19 and i am a complete fucking loser. I really really really want to change. I fucking despise being on the internet all day, now that im not smoking weed, im not comfortable being the way i am now, so im always thinking about the wasted hours and the time i spend fucking around making no real connection with people. I fucking hate myself, I FUCKING HATE MYSELF, i have nothing im a shell of my former self, was extroverted then covid hit and all of my flaws came before me was never the same since. I've been doing all of these things for years upon years sonce fucking middle school and it never once crossed my how it would affect me later or anything, fuck my younger self i wish that cocksucker could see me now. I have nothing i have nothing i have nothing i only exist eat fap get high do chores while my parents always compare me to other peoplenandni cant fucking blame them because its true im a fucking loser. If i cant change then i dont know man i dont know","Ignore that other asshat. 

You’re so young, and have so much ahead of you. 19?!  Dude you’re better off than I was at that time, and your feelings resonate. 

You clearly have recognized you don’t like this current version of yourself. 

Step 1 accomplished. Recognized the problem. Winner. Boom not a loser.

Step 2 address the problem, change . This is hard, but you seem motivated and therefore you can do it. Just tell yourself you can. Identify and move away from situations and people that hold you back from improving. Even if just temporarily.

Try and get a new perspective - move, or if you can’t, reorganize your living space. 

Throw out everything that reminds you of the things you don’t want (bongs, sell your video game consoles, clothing, art, all of it). 

Take some time and think about your future, what you want to do, what kind if life you want to have. 

Picture who you want to become, tell yourself you are that person and act like that person as best you can. 

Nobody is perfect and you WILL revert sometimes, but even if at first its two steps forward and one back, eventually it will be 20/30/40 steps forward and one back.

You will wake up one day years from now and be amazed st how far you’ve come. Start with the two steps today and go from there. 

Set small goals and hit them. 

Make your bed EVERY DAY.  Can you do that? Of course. Every day you do that you are accomplishing something, even if nothing else you wanted to do gets done, or you played video games or pulled the pickle, whatever. 

You still made your bed. 

You will be reminded at night before you go to sleep and you can do it again tomorrow. Its a small thing, but the feedback loop reminds you of your overall goal of self improvement. 

Read books, read some self improvement ones. Listen to inspiring podcasts and speakers. Lots of them felt the way you did before turning it around and becoming successful. David Goggins, Andrew Huberman, James Clear, Stephen Covey, are all good. 

Find the bits and pieces that work for you and incorporate them into your life. 

Good luck! If you want specific suggestions or questions - holler. 

You got this.","Hey, i started working on myself when I was 19 and I’m now approaching 26. You’re soo young and have so much time to make changes in your life. Time is going to pass regardless so why not spend it doing things that are good for you. One day you’re gonna be 7 years into your future no matter what so I hope that invokes some motivation. Wishing you well!","Hey, first off, it's a big step to recognize you want to change, so give yourself some credit for that. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but change is definitely possible. Start small. Pick one habit you want to change and focus on that. Maybe it's cutting down on screen time or setting a daily routine. Try to replace some of the time you spend online with something productive or fulfilling, like a walk, reading, or even a hobby you used to enjoy. 

Also, consider reaching out for professional help if you can. Therapy or counseling can be really beneficial, especially when dealing with anxiety and addiction. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to ask for help. Lastly, be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!","First off - you're 19, not a loser, and you've already taken two massive steps: getting off weed and recognizing you want change. That's huge. Many people twice your age haven't gotten that far.

Here's what you can do right now: Pick ONE small thing to fix. Just one. When you try to fix everything at once, you'll get overwhelmed and fall back into old patterns. Start with something simple like making your bed every morning or going for a 10-minute walk. Do it every day for two weeks straight. No exceptions.

For the porn and fapping - install website blockers and keep your phone out of your bedroom. Fill that time with literally anything else - pushups, reading, drawing, whatever. The urges will suck at first but they do get easier to manage.

The anxiety and mental health stuff - look into free counseling services in your area. Many places offer sliding scale fees or programs for people without income. Your brain is like any other organ - sometimes it needs professional help to work right.

For the job situation - start small here too. Update your resume and apply to just one job per day. Doesn't matter if you feel qualified. Just one application daily.

You're not broken or hopeless - you're just stuck in some bad loops that can be fixed one small step at a time. The person you are at 19 isn't who you have to be at 20. Pick that one small thing and start today. Not tomorrow, today.

Come back here and post your progress. This community will help keep you accountable.","It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed with a lot of different issues, from mental health struggles to addiction and lack of motivation. 

First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay, and it's amazing that you've stopped smoking weed - that's a huge accomplishment. Now, instead of beating yourself up over past choices, maybe try to focus on what small steps you can take today to move towards the person you want to be. 

Have you considered seeking out professional help for your anxiety and addiction? A therapist or counselor could provide you with some really valuable tools and support to help you get back on track. Additionally, there are some great resources online, like habit tracking apps and support groups, that might be able to offer some guidance and accountability.

In terms of building discipline and motivation, it might be helpful to start small. Try setting one or two achievable goals for yourself each day, like going for a walk or doing a load of laundry. As you start to build momentum and see some progress, you can gradually work your way up to bigger goals. 

It's also important to practice some self-compassion - it's okay to have flaws and make mistakes. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own journey and celebrate the tiny wins along the way. You are not defined by your past choices, and you have the power to create positive change in your life.

Lastly, remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are people who care about you and want to help, including your parents (even if their comparisons can be tough to hear). Don't give up - you've got this, and it's never too late to make a change.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a really tough spot, but the fact that you *want* to change is huge. That's the first and hardest step. Don't beat yourself up too much about the past; focus on what you can do *now*.

First, tackle one thing at a time. Trying to fix everything at once is overwhelming. Since you mentioned anxiety and it's impacting your job search, maybe start there. Look into free or low-cost mental health resources in your area. Even a single session with a therapist or counselor can give you some coping strategies.

Next, address the habits you want to break. Instead of just trying to *stop* fapping or watching porn, find something to *replace* those activities with. Exercise, reading, learning a new skill online – anything that engages your mind and body in a positive way. Even 15 minutes a day is a start.

For the job situation, break it down. Update your resume, even if it feels pointless. Spend 30 minutes each day searching for jobs and applying. Small, consistent effort is key.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not a loser. You're a person struggling with some tough challenges. Celebrate small victories, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. It's a process, not an overnight fix. You got this.

t3_10ov3e5,[need advice] I need help becoming disciplined. Even when I know the outcome will make me happy if I get up and do what needs to be done I still will let my mind bounce around and never actually do the task at hand. Tasks typically being studying or working out.,,"This is a problem that virtually everyone comes across at some point in their lives. I advise that you follow these general rules
1. the 60 second rule: if you catch yourself procrastinating, tell yourself that you will just work for 60 seconds. afterwards, it will be significantly easier for you to continue working.

2. the two minute habit rule: slowly integrate studying and exercise as habits in your life. however, when you start, you may get a surge of motivation and do too much. if you do this, you will burn out. instead, start by doing the habit in under two minutes a day, and build it up from there. instead of trying to do a full workout routine every day, just do 90 seconds worth of push-ups a day.

3. meditate daily: one of the habits you integrate should be mindfulness meditation. it will allow you to recognize when you are procrastinating faster, and it will make it easier for you to resist the procrastination.

4. the two day rule: some days you just won’t do a habit. it happens. maybe something came up, or you just had a bad day. when this happens, just don’t let it happen two days in a row, or the habit will begin to fade.

5. don’t beat yourself up. progress comes slow, and as i mentioned before, this is something everyone experiences.","I would say break things down into manageable chunks. Best advice I’ve ever gotten. 

I was in the military and was trying to get into special forces. The workouts were long and brutal. Four hour pool sessions. 

For repetitions during push-ups, pull ups, burpees, etc knowing that you have 100 burpees ahead of you is daunting and if you think about it too much you will quit. But if you break it down into manageable chunks, you can keep going no matter what. For example when I knew I had 100 I would start knocking them out. Maybe 20 at a time. Then it would get hard so I would only focus on doing 10. Then 5. Then 2. Break things up into manageable chunks!

I apply this to my life in many ways. When I know I have dishes to clean, laundry to do, meals to prep, etc. I pick one, and start with it. Don’t think about the others. Just start! Once you finish one task that sense of accomplishment will build up. And you will move onto the next. 

You got it! You are capable! Good luck 🤙","Hey there! It sounds like you're struggling with getting started, which is super common. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, if you need to study, set a timer for just 10-15 minutes and focus solely on that. Once the timer goes off, take a short break and then decide if you want to do another round. This technique, often called the Pomodoro Technique, can make tasks feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Also, try to identify the specific distractions that pull you away and find ways to minimize them, like putting your phone in another room or using apps that block distracting websites. Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself and celebrate small wins along the way. You've got this!","This is a common struggle - your mind wants the reward but resists doing the work. The key is to make starting easier than your brain's resistance. Try this: commit to just 5 minutes of studying or working out. That's it. The goal isn't to complete everything, just to begin. Usually once you start, continuing becomes much easier.

For studying, set a timer for 5 minutes and open your materials. For working out, put on your exercise clothes and do literally one set or 5 minutes of movement. If you want to stop after that, fine. But you'll often find yourself naturally wanting to continue once you've broken through that initial resistance.

Another effective approach is to remove decision-making from the equation. Pick specific times for these activities and treat them like non-negotiable appointments. ""Tuesday at 4pm is study time"" leaves less room for your mind to bounce around looking for excuses.

Start small, be consistent, and gradually build up. Your discipline is like a muscle - it gets stronger with regular exercise, but you need to start with manageable weights. Focus on showing up every day rather than having perfect sessions. The consistency matters more than intensity when you're building these habits.","It sounds like you're struggling with procrastination despite knowing the positive outcomes of your tasks. One strategy that might help is breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to study for hours,"" try telling yourself ""I'll study for 25 minutes without any distractions, and then I can take a short break."" This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can make tasks feel less overwhelming. Additionally, try to identify the specific moments when your mind starts to wander and develop a plan to refocus yourself. For example, if you always get distracted by social media, remove those apps from your phone or use a website blocker while you work. As for working out, scheduling it in your calendar like any other non-negotiable appointment can help you stick to it. Remember, discipline is built over time with consistent effort, so be patient and don't give up – every small step counts, and celebrating those tiny victories can motivate you to keep moving forward.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from.

First, try breaking down those big tasks (studying, working out) into *tiny*, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of ""study,"" it's ""open the textbook to page 1."" Or instead of ""work out,"" it's ""put on workout clothes."" Seriously, make it so easy you almost can't say no. Once you've done that tiny step, the momentum often carries you forward.

Second, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique. Set a timer for 25 minutes of focused work, then take a 5-minute break. Knowing you only have to focus for a short burst can make it less daunting.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about showing up even when you don't feel like it. If you slip up, don't beat yourself up – just get back on track with the next tiny step. Good luck!

t3_xdxiuz,[Need advice] Has anyone successfully overcome or managed a schema against self-discipline?,"Turns out I'm not just lazy, it's not just my ADHD, it's not just that I was spoiled, I've got some sort of childhood-induced massive aversion to discipline as a concept, from within or without. We're talking beyond attitude and effort and willpower. It's cost me every job and hobby I've ever had and it's cost me the love of my life. 

As soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I've been a game developer for a decade and I've never finished a game. I've been playing musical instruments and singing my entire life but I've never managed to learn sheet music or any scales or arpeggios on anything. Believe me I have tried. The trying never lasts long enough. The shame is overwhelming.

I'm sick of not being good at anything. I'm sick of this abstract baseless fear ruling my life. How the fuck am I supposed to overcome a discipline aversion without discipline?! Has anyone conquered something this deeply rooted? What steps did you take?","I looked at how my life was going and instead of getting angry or resentful, I got motivated. I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on — as you seem to well know. 

I set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. 

Now, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I’m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.

I struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I’d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don’t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I’d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn’t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn’t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. 

You need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly. Accomplishing these small goals will build confidence, which inspires motivation, which is how you build discipline. That’s how I overcame the problem you’re having.","The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won't last. If hope is your motivator, it will. 

A big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks. If you get distracted, notice the task again and feel overwhelming shame it's hugely painful, so you avoid that feeling, therefore avoiding the task. Working through that shame, so that your able to notice the thing you forgot and just go ""oh, I did want to finish that"", that's the game changer. 

It needs to be ok that you stopped the task. (Which, spoiler, it is)

Societal ways of dealing with someone (both yourself and others) forgetful or easily distracted tend to involve making the person ""care"" enough about it, which means feel so bad about it you'll never do it again. You ever had that lector from yourself or others? This doesn't work in the long run and takes a LOT of dedication and time to overcome. 

It's not that you don't care, it's that you're wired to be distracted and forgetful. Just have to restart a few times, and that's ok.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty tough challenge, but the fact that you're reaching out for advice is a great first step. Overcoming a deep-rooted aversion to discipline can be tricky, but it's definitely possible with some patience and strategy.

First, try to reframe how you view discipline. Instead of seeing it as a rigid, external force, think of it as a tool that helps you achieve what you truly want. Start small—pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas. The key is consistency, not intensity.

Also, consider breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Celebrate small wins to build momentum and confidence.

It might also help to find a community or accountability partner who shares your interests. Having someone to share progress with can make the journey feel less isolating and more motivating.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and remember that every small step forward is a victory. You've got this!","First off, you're already ahead of many people by identifying the root cause - that's huge. The good news is that deep-seated aversions can absolutely be rewired, but it requires a different approach than traditional discipline-based methods.

Start by completely removing the word ""discipline"" from your vocabulary for now. Instead, think in terms of tiny experiments and play. Your brain has associated discipline with threat, so we need to bypass that defense mechanism entirely.

Pick something absurdly small related to one of your interests - so small it feels almost meaningless. For game dev, maybe it's opening your development environment for 30 seconds. For music, maybe it's playing a single note. The key is to make it so easy that your brain's defenses don't activate.

Do this tiny thing once. That's it. No pressure to continue, no expectations of progress. The next day, do it again. If you feel any resistance, make it even smaller. We're building evidence for your brain that engaging with these activities is safe.

Only once these micro-actions feel completely neutral (usually takes 1-2 weeks) do you slightly expand them. Add 30 more seconds. Play two notes instead of one. The moment you feel that wall coming up, scale back immediately.

This isn't about willpower or pushing through. It's about gradually proving to your nervous system that these activities are safe and rewarding. Many people have overcome similar aversions this way - by going so small that the brain's protective mechanisms don't get triggered.

Remember: You're not trying to fix yourself or overcome anything. You're just running tiny, safe experiments to collect data. That's all.","It's amazing that you've identified the root cause of your struggles, and that in itself is a huge step forward. Overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline won't be easy, but it's definitely possible. One approach could be to start by reframing your perception of discipline - instead of seeing it as a restrictive or punitive force, try to view it as a tool for achieving freedom and autonomy in the areas that matter most to you. 

For example, as a game developer, you might start by setting incredibly small, almost ridiculously easy goals for yourself, like working on a project for just 5-10 minutes a day. This can help build momentum and make the idea of discipline less daunting. It's also important to focus on progress, not perfection - don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two, just acknowledge the setback and get back on track.

It might also be helpful to explore the underlying reasons for your aversion to discipline. Was there a particular event or experience in your childhood that led to this feeling? Understanding the root cause can help you address it more effectively. Additionally, consider seeking out supportive communities or accountability partners who can encourage and motivate you without being too pushy or demanding.

As for people who have overcome similar challenges, there are many stories of individuals who have successfully developed discipline and achieved their goals despite initial resistance. It's often a matter of finding the right strategies, support systems, and mindset shifts that work for you. You might find inspiration in the stories of people like James Clear, who writes about building good habits and overcoming obstacles, or Josh Waitzkin, who has written about cultivating discipline and resilience in pursuit of his passions.

Remember, overcoming a deep-seated aversion to discipline is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take it one step at a time, and to be patient with yourself as you work through this process. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the issue and seeking help - now it's just a matter of finding the right approach and support to help you move forward.","Hey, that sounds incredibly frustrating, and you're definitely not alone in struggling with deeply rooted aversions. It's awesome that you're actively trying to understand and address it.

Instead of tackling ""discipline"" head-on, maybe try reframing it. Think of it less as a rigid set of rules and more as a set of *agreements* you make with yourself to achieve something you genuinely want.

Since you're a game developer, could you gamify your own life? Break down tasks into tiny, achievable quests with small rewards. Focus on the *process* of building a habit, not the *outcome* of finishing a game or mastering scales. For example, instead of ""learn scales,"" try ""practice one scale for 5 minutes every day."" The goal is consistency, not perfection.

Also, consider therapy if you aren't already. A therapist specializing in trauma or attachment issues might help you unpack the childhood roots of this aversion and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Shame is a motivation killer. Celebrate small wins, acknowledge your progress, and remember that setbacks are part of the process. You've got this!

t3_11f5i81,[need advice] Seriously- how do you beat social media addiction?,"Hey all- my life has changed for the better with the journey of self growth. I have quit smoking successfully, i read, workout, can be productive. The one thing holding me back from being 99% efficient is social media use. I have done a dopamine detox, i have definitely reduced my screen time these past few months. I try to delete the apps during the week. However i always find myself redownloading them and procrastinating while i KNOW consciously what i’m supposed to be doing.  I am off of tiktok and facebook, but snapchat and instagram are my weak points. 


I know i’m not the only one going through this, however i feel like i am missing out on communication even though i know i’m not.  I don’t have a huge social life at the moment and that is probably the problem. That being said- any advice/tips are welcome. It truly is an addiction - it’s wild!! Thanks all.","You don't really need to cut out social media completely from your life, in my opinion it's still required for socializing.

What you can do is try to find things to do that can keep you entertained and busy during the times that you usually want to pick up your phone. Busy hands are great to keep the phone away.

If you find yourself returning too much, then try to reduce the amount of stimulation you get from your social media. Avoid ""for you"" recommendations such as the explore tab on Instagram, and mute the stories and posts on friends who you don't really keep up with. It's ok to still look at what your friends are doing, but try to catch yourself before you go down the ""explore"" rabbit hole.

I've recently broken up with my ex and this is what I do to try and stop stalking their every move. Find other more productive things to distract yourself with and only keep up with those you really care about. Social media detox is hard, so it's better to make it easier one step at a time. Motivation is fickle when there is a high hurdle.","Here are a few things you can do. Also as boring as it can sound find something you want to learn about this way at least you are using that time to benefit you.

Adopt a “Digital Sabbath”: Schedule a day of the week when you refrain from using social media, digital devices and apps for 24 hours.  


Alternate your usage: Limit your engagement on social media to alternating days, or at least limit the amount of time you spend on it daily.  


Take advantage of tools like Screen Time which allow users to set limits on their app usage and can be used as reminders of how often they are engaging with social media.  


Practice mindfulness and be aware of emotions that may arise from engaging with certain content on social media platforms such as anxiety or frustration.  


Unfollow/unsubscribe from accounts that create feelings of envy or insecurity that may lead to higher engagement levels when viewing them.  


Aim for quality, not quantity: Instead of spending lots of time mindlessly scrolling through feeds, focus on having fewer but more meaningful engagements online with friends, family and acquaintances.","Hey there! First off, congrats on all the progress you've made so far—quitting smoking and getting into reading and working out is no small feat. Tackling social media addiction can be tough, but you're definitely not alone in this. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Try setting specific times during the day when you allow yourself to check social media. Outside of those times, keep the apps deleted or logged out. This can help you regain control over when and how you use them.

2. **Find Alternatives**: Since you mentioned not having a huge social life right now, maybe look into activities that can fill that gap. Joining clubs, taking classes, or even online communities focused on your interests can provide that social interaction without the endless scroll.

3. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware of your goals can be a great motivator.

4. **Mindfulness**: When you feel the urge to redownload or check the apps, pause and ask yourself what you're hoping to get out of it. Sometimes just being aware of the impulse can help you redirect it.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've already made significant strides, and with a bit more tweaking, you'll get there. Keep at it!","First off, congrats on the progress you've already made - quitting smoking and building healthy habits like reading and working out is huge. Social media addiction is definitely challenging because unlike other habits, total elimination isn't always practical in today's world.

Since you mentioned missing out on communication, try setting specific ""social media hours"" - maybe 30 minutes in the morning and evening to catch up with people. This lets you maintain connections while containing usage to defined periods. During these windows, be intentional about actually engaging (commenting, messaging friends) rather than mindless scrolling.

For the redownloading cycle, make it harder on yourself. Use app blockers that require a waiting period to disable. Log out of accounts so you need to enter passwords each time. Move social apps to a folder on the last page of your phone. The goal is to add friction between the impulse and action.

To address the social life aspect - consider joining some local groups related to your interests (reading clubs, fitness classes, etc). Having more in-person social outlets naturally reduces the pull of social media. You could also schedule regular calls/meetups with friends so you're getting that connection without defaulting to apps.

Remember that building discipline isn't about perfection. If you slip up, just reset and try again. The fact that you're conscious of the issue and actively working on it means you're already on the right path.","Beating social media addiction is definitely a tough one, especially when you feel like you're missing out on communication with others. First, kudos to you for recognizing the issue and taking steps to reduce your screen time - that's a huge accomplishment. One strategy that might help is to replace social media with other activities that give you a sense of connection, like joining online forums or groups related to your interests, or scheduling regular video calls with friends and family. This way, you can still feel connected without mindlessly scrolling through Snapchat and Instagram. 

Another approach could be to set specific goals for what you want to achieve during the week, and then use website blockers or app limitations to help you stay on track. For example, you could allow yourself to check social media only after you've completed a certain task or reached a milestone. It's also worth considering why you feel the need to check social media in the first place - is it boredom, loneliness, or something else? Once you identify the underlying reason, you can start working on alternative solutions to address that feeling. 

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's not about being 99% efficient all the time. You've already made significant progress with quitting smoking and developing other positive habits, so be patient with yourself as you work through this challenge. Good luck!","Hey, congrats on quitting smoking and all the progress you've made! Social media is a tough one, so don't beat yourself up too much. It sounds like you've already tried some good strategies.

Since deleting/reinstalling isn't a long-term fix, maybe try focusing on *replacing* the time you'd spend on those apps. You mentioned not having a huge social life right now - could you actively schedule one or two small social activities each week? Even something simple like meeting a friend for coffee or joining a local club related to your interests. That way, you're addressing the feeling of missing out by actually engaging in real-life connections.

Another thing that might help is to make it harder to mindlessly open the apps. Try logging out every time you close them, or burying them deep in a folder on your phone. A little friction can go a long way. Also, set specific time limits for yourself within the apps (most phones have built-in features for this) and *really* stick to them. It's about building that discipline muscle. Good luck, you got this!

t3_zr6wn3,[Need Advice] How do I rewire my brain for discipline and creativity?,I am naturally lazy and I can't do anything. I always imagine myself doing things and vicariously live though other successful people but can't do anything for myself. What should I do? How do I change my brain to get out of this slump and actually make changes to my life?,"I'm also a naturally lazy af person. Which is why I'm using my computer and phone to speed up most of my processes. However, having tech in your hands will most of the time result into procrastination.

So this is what I did initially before rewiring my brain for discipline, creativity, and productivity -- I basically started identifying the activities I'm doing every day into 3 areas of my life:

- Career and Growth
- Health and Key Relationships
- Quality of Life

If an activity does not fit my main categories, there are 2 options for me. It's either:

- remove them completely in my life if I think it won't help reaching my goals
- or use them as a reward whenever I gain points from doing my daily activities -- Gamification System

I hope my experience helps in some way.",Your first problem is identifying yourself as “naturally lazy”. Good luck achieving anything with that mindset.,"Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to make some changes, which is a great first step. Here’s a simple approach to get started:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one small habit you want to build. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or spending 5 minutes sketching or writing. The key is consistency, not intensity.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve in both discipline and creativity. Break these down into manageable tasks. For example, if you want to write a book, start with writing 100 words a day.

3. **Create a Routine**: Try to do your new habit at the same time every day. This helps your brain associate that time with the activity, making it easier to stick with it.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, no matter how small. This positive reinforcement can help keep you motivated.

6. **Be Patient and Kind to Yourself**: Change takes time, and setbacks are part of the process. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day—just get back on track the next day.

Remember, building discipline and creativity is a journey, not a sprint. Good luck, and keep pushing forward!","The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum gradually. Your brain won't rewire overnight, but you can train it through consistent tiny actions. Pick one simple thing you want to do - maybe writing for 5 minutes, drawing for 10 minutes, or working on a project for 15 minutes. Make it so easy you can't say no.

Then set a specific time each day for this mini-task. The time of day matters less than consistency. When that time comes, just do that one tiny thing. Don't worry about doing more, even if you feel motivated to. Build the habit first.

After a couple weeks of consistency with your mini-task, you can gradually increase the time or add another small habit. The goal is to prove to yourself that you can follow through. Each small win reinforces that you ARE capable of doing things, not just dreaming about them.

For the creativity aspect - set aside dedicated time to consume inspiring content in your field of interest, but limit it to maybe 20% of your practice time. The other 80% should be actually creating, even if it's bad at first. Remember that all those successful people you admire started somewhere too, usually with work they weren't proud of.

Your brain will resist change at first. That's normal. But if you stick to tiny, consistent actions, you'll slowly build new neural pathways. Focus on the process rather than results. Show up daily for your mini-task, celebrate small wins, and trust that compound interest works with habits too.","It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a motivation gap, which is totally common. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as doing one load of laundry, or spending 10 minutes working on a creative project. The idea is to build momentum and get yourself used to taking action, rather than just imagining it. Additionally, you might find it helpful to explore the concept of ""implementation intentions"" - this is where you specify when and where you'll take a specific action, which can help make it feel more concrete and achievable. For example, you might say to yourself ""at 7am tomorrow, I'll spend 30 minutes working on my novel"". By making a clear plan and starting small, you can begin to build discipline and creativity habits that will serve you well in the long run.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough when you feel stuck in that cycle of wanting to do things but not actually doing them. The good news is, you *can* change it. It's not about ""rewiring"" your brain overnight, but more about building momentum with small, consistent actions.

First, stop comparing yourself to others. Seriously. It's a motivation killer. Instead, focus on *one tiny* thing you want to achieve. Like, ridiculously tiny. Want to write? Commit to writing one sentence a day. Want to exercise? Do one push-up. The point is to make it so easy you can't say no.

Once you've consistently done that tiny thing for a week or two, *then* you can gradually increase it. One sentence becomes two, one push-up becomes two. The key is consistency over intensity.

Also, break down bigger goals into smaller, manageable steps. ""Make changes to my life"" is huge and overwhelming. Instead, think ""What's one small thing I can do *today* that will move me in the right direction?""

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're going to slip up. It happens. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck!

t3_twv6xx,[Need Advice] How do I prevent burnout from self-care?,"I've been very consistent and disciplined about the past 6 months. Early on, I read articles on preventing burnout and they said I need to eat healthier, drink water, etc. and so I prioritised those things. I also prioritised having a good social life, sleep, having a clean environment etc. But I was still experiencing burnout and I decided to do the bare minimum for a week and my personality had a radical change - I was much calmer, happier and rational. In other words, my burnout decreased significantly. That means it was these healthy things that were causing my burnout. How do I prevent burnout from taking care of myself?

Edit: Thank you all so much!","I think you may have fallen into the trap of toxic productivity, or the idea that you should be productive all of the time. Applied to self care that would be the idea that you have to always eat healthy, always sleep 8 hours a night, meditate everyday, etc. And those are very important, but you shouldn’t obsess about them. It’s okay to not do those things sometimes. It’s all about balance.","You pay attention to how you feel and what is happening for you in any moment, and you honour that. In my experience rest is the most important form of self care and also the most underrated in a society that is so focused on output. So, build in more time for rest, adjust your expectations of yourself when it comes to how much you want to get done and find ways to get what your body needs that aren’t creating more stress. 

Self care should never be about ticking boxes, it’s about learning to listen to yourself and using that information to determine what you need the most at that time. It could be rest, or social time or saying no to something - you don’t know until you stop and assess where you are right now.

Good luck OP 😊","It sounds like you've been doing a lot to take care of yourself, which is awesome, but it’s possible to overdo even the good stuff. Self-care should feel like a break, not another item on your to-do list. Maybe try simplifying your routine and focusing on what truly makes you feel good rather than what you think you should be doing. It’s okay to have days where you just do the basics and give yourself permission to relax. Also, consider mixing in activities that are purely for fun or creativity, without any pressure to achieve something. Balance is key, and sometimes less is more. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!","It sounds like you might be approaching self-care as another set of tasks to rigidly complete rather than activities that should make you feel better. Self-care shouldn't feel like a burden - it's about finding the right balance that works for you.

Try scaling back to focus on what actually makes you feel good and energized. Not every healthy habit needs to happen every single day. Maybe you feel great after socializing twice a week rather than forcing yourself to go out every night. Or perhaps meal prepping on Sundays works better than cooking fresh daily.

Start by picking 2-3 core habits that give you the most benefit and make those non-negotiable. Then treat the others as ""nice to haves"" that you can flex around your energy levels. The goal is sustainable progress, not perfection.

Remember that rest and downtime are also forms of self-care. If taking a week to do the bare minimum helped you feel better, that's valuable information. Consider building regular ""low power mode"" days into your routine where you deliberately dial things back. This isn't failing at self-care - it's actually listening to what your body and mind need.

The best self-care routine is one you can maintain long-term without burning out. Keep what works, modify or drop what doesn't, and be willing to adjust as needed.","It sounds like you've stumbled upon a really interesting insight - that sometimes, even good habits can contribute to burnout if they become too overwhelming or rigid. One potential approach could be to re-evaluate your self-care routine and see if there are any areas where you can scale back or make things more flexible. For example, instead of feeling like you need to cook a healthy meal every night, maybe you could aim for 3-4 nights a week and give yourself permission to have something simpler the other nights. Similarly, you might consider prioritizing the self-care activities that bring you the most joy and relaxation, and letting go of any that feel more like obligations. By finding a better balance and being kinder to yourself, you may be able to reduce your risk of burnout while still taking care of your physical and emotional needs.","Hey, that's a really interesting situation! It sounds like you've been super dedicated, which is awesome, but also highlights a key point: self-care isn't one-size-fits-all.

It seems like you might have been overdoing it, turning self-care into another set of rigid rules. The goal is to *reduce* stress, not add to it. Maybe you were trying to optimize everything at once, which can be exhausting in itself.

Instead of a blanket approach, try experimenting to find what *actually* recharges you. Maybe a super clean environment is less important than, say, 15 minutes of reading a fun book. Or maybe forcing a social life when you need alone time is draining.

Think about what truly relaxes you and makes you feel good, and then prioritize *those* things. Also, consider that your needs might change over time. What works now might not work in a few months, so be open to adjusting your routine. It's about finding a sustainable balance, not achieving some perfect ideal of ""healthy living."" Good luck!

t3_10k9n0w,[Need Advice] what to do when traumatic memories put you in a funk and ruin your day and productivity?,"i’m recovering from severe trauma (in therapy) and some days are good, most are normal, but some are really bad. one traumatic memory or flashback is enough to ruin my whole day and productivity. one traumatic memory leads to another and soon there’s a whirlpool in my head and now i can’t study anymore. and even when the memories have stopped i can’t snap back to my previous mental state and temperament and the gross feeling in my stomach remains the whole day. how do i get out of this funk and not let my whole day go to waste?","This has been me for years and I think I’ve finally found a way to overcome this. As far as my story goes, I had a traumatic brain injury 12 years ago, followed by trauma with friends, family, roommates, employers… the whole shebang. But I’m an engineer, so I’ve spent the last 12 years trying to find a solution to all of my issues. Obsessed with it really. If you want tips on other approaches to handling trauma, like mindsets, routines, supplements, or life style, you can DM me and I’d be happy to offer some simple, small steps you could take to help in those areas too. 

But as far as the one thing that finally helped me get out of bed and stop playing minesweeper for hours on end is massaging my body. This relieved the build up of tension in my body, which eased the tension in my mind. 

This might sound antithetical to fixing your thoughts, but despite everything I’ve tried this is the biggest thing that’s calmed my thoughts. It makes perfect sense to me why it works too, but unfortunately it isn’t used a whole lot in the western world’s counseling. It’s picking up, but it’s still in its infancy. 

Anyway, the body and the mind are one thing: the brain and the nervous system. You notice how when you get nervous you tense up? Or when you get angry you have this build up of energy that makes you want to punch something? Or when you’re shy you just want to curl up in a ball? This is your mind telling your body how to react to these emotions… how to handle the energy behind these emotions… to release the build up of energy (anger) or to preserve the little energy you have left (exhaustion). 

But the nervous system is a two way street. Just as the mind can tell the body how to behave, the body can tell the mind how to behave. 

Trauma is a psychological condition that affects our entire nervous system. This explains the cramp you feel in your stomach. Our nervous system is what’s responsible for all of our organs. It’s what relays messages from the mind to your stomach to tell you you’re full, for example. So the traumatic thoughts you’re having and the tension you feel in your body are one illness. Helping one helps the other. 

As for how to massage, here’s my routine. I like doing things bottom up, step by step, but you can do it in whatever way feels comfortable for you. If my description is too much for you right now that’s ok, just start with the first one and you can slowly work in the other ones later at whatever feels comfortable for you. 

If you have a massage ball or anything you can roll on your skin that would help too, but it isn’t needed.  Some important notes are included. 

1. Feet. Start here. They have over 2000 nerves and are an important player in releasing tension. They’re what ground us to this planet and are what support our entire structure. 

2. Slowly work you’re way up each leg. You can do one at a time or both, it doesn’t matter. 

3. Once you’re up to the thighs, play close attention to your inner thighs. The sacral nerve is here and it’s a very important nerve to massage. It’s a main nerve that’s responsible for your bladder and rectal muscles. Massage will  especially help if you have diarrhea or constipation. 

4. Slowly work your way up the side of your torso and gently massaging your abdomen. Massaging your sides will help calm your vagus nerve, which is a main nerve responsible for digestion, heart rate, and immune system. Likely responsible for your stomach issues. 

5. Arms. Start by placing your hands on the opposite shoulder and giving yourself a hug. Give just a gentle squeeze and slowly work your way down your arms, to your wrists, and back up again. Do this a couple times if it feels comfortable and end by massaging the back of each shoulder. The gentle hug isn’t only good for your nervous system, but your psyche as well, often bringing us back to memories of being loved as a little kid, and receiving protection. 

6. Massage the sides of the neck. The vagus nerve runs through here and is a good spot to massage. 

7. The head. Slowly start from the bottom, working your way up to your scalp. The jaw often holds a lot of tension for a lot of people and is a really good spot to focus on. If you have real vagus nerve issues like I do, the ear area is a really good spot to focus on too, specifically the left ear. It’s where the nerve starts. Be gentle here. The ear:
1. Massage above the ear, gently moving the skin in whatever way feels comfortable. 
2. Place your finger in the ridge of your lobe, just gently moving around. It doesn’t take much movement here. 
3. Place your pinky finger inside your ear and very gently push against the back of your ear. 

You can finish massaging your scalp and you’re done! 

Notice how your thoughts are now. They should likely be much more relaxed. 

Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any.","thank you so so so much. that’s very helpful, i appreciate your time so much <3","I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds tough, but it's great that you're in therapy and working on recovery. When those tough days hit, it might help to have a few strategies ready to ground yourself and regain some control. One approach is to create a ""reset routine""—a series of small, comforting actions that help you shift your focus. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing some deep breathing exercises, or listening to a favorite song. These activities can help break the cycle of negative thoughts and give you a moment to regroup. Also, try setting very small, manageable goals for the day. Even if you can't be as productive as you'd like, accomplishing something small can help you feel a bit more in control. Remember, it's okay to have off days, and being kind to yourself is also a form of discipline. Keep going, and take it one step at a time.","First, it's great that you're already working with a therapist - that's a huge step. For managing those difficult days when memories intrude, try creating a ""reset routine"" - a series of small, manageable actions you can do to help ground yourself and gradually return to productivity.

A simple reset routine might be: stepping outside for 5 minutes of fresh air, doing 10 slow breaths, drinking a glass of water, and washing your face with cold water. The physical sensations can help bring you back to the present moment.

When you're having a particularly rough day, instead of trying to force yourself back to full productivity, try the ""5-minute rule."" Tell yourself you'll work on something for just 5 minutes. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and you might find yourself able to continue once you begin. If not, that's okay too - even 5 minutes of progress is better than none.

Breaking your work into smaller chunks can also help. Rather than thinking ""I need to study for 3 hours,"" try ""I'll read one page"" or ""I'll solve one problem."" This makes tasks feel more manageable when you're not at 100%.

Remember that recovery isn't linear, and some days will be harder than others. Having strategies ready for those tough days isn't admitting defeat - it's smart planning. Keep building your toolkit of coping strategies with your therapist, and be proud of any progress you make, no matter how small it seems.","It's completely understandable that traumatic memories can be overwhelming and affect your daily life. One strategy that might help is to develop a ""reset routine"" for when you feel like you're getting pulled into that whirlpool. This could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or doing some light stretching - anything that helps signal to your brain that it's time to shift gears. Additionally, you might consider setting a ""re-entry point"" for when you feel like you're ready to start being productive again, like making a cup of tea or doing a quick creative activity. This can help you gradually come back to a more focused state without feeling overwhelmed. It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be okay, and some days it's just about survival - so don't be too hard on yourself if you can't get everything done that you wanted to. Have you talked to your therapist about developing some coping strategies for when these memories come up, or are there any specific techniques they've recommended that you've found helpful?","Hey, that sounds really tough, and it's awesome you're in therapy working through it. It's totally understandable that those days can derail you.

Here's a thought: instead of trying to instantly ""snap back,"" maybe focus on damage control and harm reduction for those days. When you feel that whirlpool starting, could you try a pre-planned ""reset"" activity? Something short and specific that you know can ground you a little. It could be a 5-minute meditation, a quick walk outside, listening to a favorite song, or even just making a cup of tea and focusing on the sensations.

The key is to have it ready to go, so you don't have to think about it in the moment. Think of it like a fire extinguisher for your brain. It won't solve everything, but it might stop the fire from spreading.

Also, maybe lower your expectations for productivity on those days. Instead of aiming to study like normal, could you aim for something smaller and more manageable? Like, ""I'll read one chapter"" or ""I'll work on this for 30 minutes."" Even a little progress is a win. And be kind to yourself – recovery isn't linear.

t3_tnjz7q,[Need Advice],I'm trying to make a habit that i self study 4 hours a day. And i don't know what reward / punishment should i take if i can do it or not. Pls give me some suggestions.,"I agree with unimatrix you should cut your goal down. I’d suggest 40 mins. Have you ever heard of the Pomodoro technique? You can break your 4 hours into smaller junks with rewards in between. Rewards can be a nice healthy snack, some time on Reddit, tv, or a game.","Do 1H 30MIN, slowly progressing is so much easier","Creating a habit of self-studying for 4 hours a day is a great goal! For rewards, consider something small but meaningful that you can look forward to, like watching an episode of your favorite show, enjoying a special snack, or taking a relaxing walk. For punishments, try something that gently nudges you back on track without being too harsh, like doing an extra chore or limiting screen time. Remember, the key is consistency and making sure your rewards and punishments are motivating for you personally. Also, start by breaking your study time into smaller chunks with breaks in between to make it more manageable. Good luck!","Hey there! For building a 4-hour daily study habit, I'd actually recommend steering clear of punishment-based systems since they often backfire and create negative associations with studying. Instead, focus on small rewards that reinforce the habit without becoming a crutch.

Some effective reward ideas: taking a 30-minute break to do something you enjoy after completing your study block, tracking your streak in a habit app and celebrating milestones, or saving a small amount of money each day you complete your study goal that you can later spend on something meaningful to you.

The key is starting small - try breaking those 4 hours into smaller chunks like 2x2 hours or 4x1 hour sessions with short breaks in between. This makes it less daunting and gives you multiple ""mini-wins"" throughout the day.

A simple system that works well: Put a checkmark on your calendar for each day you complete your study goal. At the end of each week where you hit 5+ days, give yourself permission to do something enjoyable (maybe watching that show you've been wanting to see or getting your favorite meal). The consistency matters more than perfection.

Remember that building this habit is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on making it sustainable rather than perfect from day one.","Setting aside 4 hours daily for self-study is a significant commitment, and having a reward/punishment system can be a great motivator. For rewards, consider something you enjoy but rarely make time for, like reading a chapter in a favorite book, watching an episode of your favorite show, or taking a relaxing bath. You could also treat yourself to a nice dinner or try a new recipe. As for punishments, they should be mild and not discourage you from trying again the next day - like doing an extra chore, giving up a small luxury item for the day, or having to explain to a friend or family member why you didn't meet your goal (accountability can be a strong motivator). Remember, the key is consistency and patience. It might take some experimentation to find the right balance of rewards and punishments that work for you, so don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Keep track of your progress and adjust your system as needed. Good luck with your self-study habit!","Hey! That's a great goal. Four hours of self-study is ambitious, so let's think about rewards and ""punishments"" (though I prefer to think of them as disincentives).

For rewards, try to make them things you genuinely enjoy and that fit into your study schedule. Maybe after a successful day, you get to watch an episode of your favorite show, play a video game for an hour, or treat yourself to a nice coffee. The key is to make it something you look forward to.

As for disincentives, avoid anything too harsh that will make you feel bad about yourself. Instead, think about things that are mildly annoying or that you'd rather avoid. For example, if you miss a day, maybe you have to do some extra chores around the house, donate a small amount of money to a cause you *don't* support, or skip your favorite social media for a day.

Also, don't be afraid to adjust your study schedule or rewards/disincentives as you go. What works in the beginning might not work later on. Good luck!

t3_uhpcm2,[Need advice] 22 year old anxious PTSD-ridden NEET trying to grow wings and quit being a manchild,"i'm 22 and i just, JUST started doing the laundry/dishes/showering/brushing my teeth daily, after 3ish years of literally nothing. my room got so fucked, i have no friends and shit work experience; however i have skills in writing (that's it) and i'm in good shape and conventionally attractive and that's about all i have going for me, if it weren't for these i'd be the man without a life from South Park. EDIT: actually, bonus, not an incel/supreme Redditor/4channer/porn addict, so i have some perks

i mean literally nothing, not even TV/video games, just almost pure catatonia. to make things short i had a really fucked up violent childhood, neglect, most of my family passed away including my mom (who OD'd in front of me when i was 16 and uhhh... yeah, that's mostly the reason why i am the way that i am now), bullying, exposure to drugs/alcohol and intimate partner violence/SERIOUS abuse, including a false accusation of S/A (she has BPD and conveniently forgot she consented to something after she found a Reddit post talking about her s3xual abuse at the end of the relationship)

my doctor prescribed me benzos at 15 and at 17 started taking them more and at 19 was hooked daily. i was done with life and COVID hit and i experienced some more trauma and decided fuck it and became an alcoholic drug addict NEET that didn't shower for weeks. i went to rehab and i'm still recovering and am sober but feel like i'm always going to be a fucking overgrown boy because i failed to adapt. 

if you haven't guessed there wasn't really another adult presence in my life (got handed over to an abusive adult girlfriend, basically) and my mom was always nodding off, like never really there for her last five years - i didn't learn anything, and skipped school but graduated with AP classes/high ACT score and somehow did 2 years of college, i missed a lot of development and i feel like i'll never be like everyone else, i don't like myself at all. and I don't want to make anymore excuses, i inherited the house and me and my NEET brother live alone and don't work, but he is still an addict

also yes i am in therapy, clearly. i have tried to kill myself before, but i feel hopeful now. i just feel like it's too late and i'll never learn good behaviors. :/

i remember one day i was going downstairs to my single bare mattress on the floor, with trash all around it, plates, rotting food etc. and it was all gone because my ex cleaned it all up. i needed hospitalized in a psychiatric unit at an earlier age, but was only able to get help this year.

i just don't wanna fuckin be this way anymore, such a sad pathetic existence.","Hey man, I'm not a licensed professional. But I do have someone in my life that ended up as a NEET. It hurts me so much when I think of him--because he is one of the smartest, most capable people I know. He also had trauma, and in his case he couldn't go out due to social anxiety.

&#x200B;

The first thing I would do is try to change how you view yourself. It seems like you are on the right track for that--taking care of your body and mind plays a big role in that respect.

&#x200B;

It's true that in life, connections and background get you far. You do need to put your foot in the door to move forward. But at the end of the day, you have to acknowledge that you are in control of your future. Yes, at this point it may be harder for you to make it than it would be for someone with tons of connections. But our hardships only mean something if we decide to take them lying down.

&#x200B;

I might recommend something--whatever you're trying to aim for, try and make incremental steps every day towards that goal. If for you that's a job, then apply to at least three-four jobs a day. No matter how shitty you feel while you're doing it(I know it can feel really intimidating), do it anyway. It may only take an hour or two. When you're done, not only can you acknowledge that you did something incredibly substantial in a short amount of time, you've just improved your chances of getting a job you want. If you want to go really hard, add on top of that--you have to cold-email/message someone at a company you want to work for. Do that, and you're a god.

&#x200B;

Keep a calendar in your room, and every time you finish your step for the day, cross off a date. Do everything you can to not break your chain.

&#x200B;

I like to hold this practice when doing something difficult for me--I count down from ten, and by the time I reach 0, I have to start the task. This gets rid of the anxiety associated with starting in the first place. This applies to social situations too--I count down from 5, and by the time I reach zero, I have to go interact with whoever I have to, whether that be a stranger, a cashier, or a long-time friend.

&#x200B;

When doing all of this stuff, it's okay to sometimes struggle through the tasks. Starting and showing up are more important. HOWEVER, IMO it's never okay to not believe in yourself. When you're filling out job applications, know that one day, you will get the job you're looking for. That doesn't mean never learn from mistakes, that means have faith in the process of progress. Small steps lead to big changes over time.

&#x200B;

I really hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. I'd recommend starting by doing something simple now, *right now*, like making your bed. See what difference it makes over time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, don't let the label of NEET define you. Yes, you are a 'NEET' right now. But tell yourself that you only need to take more chances. Being a NEET doesn't mean you can't succeed, and don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You need to get lucky. But luck comes to those who search for it. If you try enough times, even if your success is 1 in 100, you'll  likely get it after 100 tries.","thanks

i've been through a lot of really ridiculous shit, in a really short period of time that happened to be my developing years, enough for me to think i was a bad person and better off dead. now that i'm clear-headed i want a better future for myself, and while i don't think i should get life on easy mode due to my experiences, i think i deserve love and happiness. 

i'm wanting to go back to school, and i'm trying to take a lot of inspiration from people like Chris Gardner and my counselor in rehab who really overcame adversity - it makes me feel like there's hope for me. 

i just need to believe in myself, also lol never partaken in any criminal shit/been locked up, but looking at stories of successful ex-cons helps a lot. prison is a way lower place than where i am now, I've got this.","Hey there, first off, I want to say that it's a big deal that you're reaching out and trying to make changes. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and the fact that you're sober and starting to take care of yourself is a huge step forward. 

Building discipline is like building a muscle; it takes time and consistent effort. Start small and be patient with yourself. You've already begun with daily tasks like laundry and brushing your teeth, which is awesome. Try to add one new habit at a time. Maybe set a goal to go for a short walk every day or spend 10 minutes writing, since you mentioned you have skills in that area. 

Routine can be your best friend. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day. It might help to write down a simple daily schedule and stick to it as best as you can. Celebrate small victories, like completing a task or sticking to your routine for a week. 

Also, don't hesitate to lean on your therapist for support and guidance. They can help you navigate this journey and offer strategies tailored to your needs. Remember, it's never too late to learn and grow. You've got this!","First off - you're already making progress. Getting into daily hygiene and basic household tasks after years of struggle is a real achievement. Don't minimize that. You're not ""too late"" at 22 - you're actually catching things relatively early, considering what you've been through.

The fact that you're sober, in therapy, and actively working to change shows incredible resilience. Now let's build on that momentum.

Start by creating a bare-minimum daily routine. You've got hygiene and some household tasks - excellent foundation. Add one small thing at a time. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, or a 5-minute walk outside, or reading one page of a book. The key is to keep it ridiculously simple at first.

Since you mentioned writing skills, consider starting a simple journal. Just 5 minutes each day to track your progress and thoughts. This can help you recognize your improvements over time, which is crucial when you're rebuilding.

For work experience - look into remote writing gigs. Content writing, copywriting, or technical writing can be good entry points. Start small with platforms like Upwork or by building a portfolio on Medium. This lets you work from home while building experience.

Remember that progress isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, and that's normal. The goal isn't perfection - it's just doing a bit better than yesterday.

You've already proven you can change by getting sober and establishing basic routines. Keep building on that foundation, one small step at a time. You've got this.","It's amazing that you've started taking care of yourself with daily tasks like laundry and showering - that's a huge step forward. Given your history, it's understandable that you feel like you're behind or that you'll never catch up, but the truth is that everyone develops at their own pace. The fact that you're in therapy and have stopped using substances is a testament to your strength and willingness to change.

Rather than focusing on what you haven't learned or accomplished, try to build on the small wins you've had so far. You mentioned you have skills in writing - why not start by setting aside some time each day or week to work on a writing project? It could be as simple as journaling or writing short stories. This can help you build confidence and a sense of purpose.

It's also great that you're recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself and your living space. Consider breaking down larger tasks, like cleaning and organizing your room, into smaller, manageable chunks. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

Remember that you don't have to do this alone. Your therapist is there to support you, and you may also want to consider joining a support group or finding online communities of people who are going through similar experiences. Having a network of people who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.

Lastly, try to be kinder to yourself. You've been through an enormous amount of trauma, and it's okay that you're not where you want to be yet. You're taking steps towards healing and growth, and that's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, even if it feels like a slow process - every step you take is a step away from the life you don't want and towards the one you do.","Hey, first off, huge respect for sharing all that. It takes serious guts. You've already made massive progress just by getting sober and starting those daily hygiene habits. That's not nothing, that's a foundation.

It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to catch up all at once. Instead of trying to overhaul everything, maybe focus on one or two small, achievable goals each week. Since you mentioned writing skills, could you commit to writing for just 15 minutes a day? Or maybe try going for a short walk outside each morning? Small wins build momentum and confidence.

Also, dealing with a NEET brother who's still struggling with addiction is a huge weight. Have you considered Al-Anon or a similar support group for family members of addicts? It could give you some tools to navigate that situation and protect your own sobriety and mental health.

Don't beat yourself up about the past. You're not the same person you were then. You're actively working on yourself, and that's what matters. Keep going to therapy, be patient with yourself, and celebrate every small victory. You've got this.

t3_q2vpv3,[Need Advice] How can I get myself to stop procrastinating?,"I’m a high school student and I procrastinate a lot and it’s starting to show in my grades. Usually I tell myself “I’ll do it in a hour” while laying in my bed watching Netflix or scrolling Reddit, but when the hour passes I just repeat the same thing until it’s time to go to sleep. I’ve tried setting alarms so far but haven’t got anywhere.","A part of procrastination is an emotional response to the work you have to do. Do you think this may be to anxiety or nervousness about the work? It’s possible that you ignore the work because you’re feeling pressure (that you put on yourself) to complete it. Which in a way shows that you do value the work that you have to complete. 

Cut yourself a little bit of slack and think about how you are emotionally responding to the stress of the work you have to do. Think about that and then try and implement some of the other strategies mentioned in this thread such as the Pomodoro Technique.","The reward (Netflix etc.) has to come AFTER you've gotten something done. 

Look up the Pomodoro method. It's basically working on something in a focused manner for 25 mins. Then reward yourself with something. Then do some more and reward yourself again.","Hey there! Procrastination is something a lot of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of telling yourself you'll do it in an hour, try setting a timer for just 10 or 15 minutes and commit to working during that time. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going. Also, consider creating a dedicated study space away from distractions like your bed or phone. It can help to associate that space with focus and productivity. Lastly, try to reward yourself after completing tasks, even if it's something small. It can make the process a bit more enjoyable. Good luck, you've got this!","Hey there - I totally get the Netflix/Reddit loop, it's a common trap. Here's what's worked for many students in your situation:

First, get out of bed. Seriously. Your bed should only be for sleeping - when you try to study there, your brain gets confused about whether it's time to focus or relax. Find a dedicated study spot, even if it's just a corner of your room with a desk.

The ""in an hour"" promise is sneaky because it feels like you're being responsible, but it just delays the inevitable. Instead, try the ""5-minute rule"" - tell yourself you'll work for just 5 minutes. That's it. Usually once you actually start, you'll naturally want to continue. The hardest part is just beginning.

For alarms, they only work if there are consequences. Put your phone across the room when studying. Even better, use apps like Forest that ""plant"" virtual trees that die if you leave the app to check social media. It adds a small but effective mental barrier.

Start small and build up. Don't try to reform your entire study routine overnight. Pick one subject or assignment, set a specific time (like right after school), and stick to it for a week. Small wins create momentum.

Remember: procrastination isn't about laziness - it's about managing discomfort. The more you practice pushing through that initial resistance, the easier it gets. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the problem and asking for help. You've got this.","It sounds like you're caught in a pretty common cycle. One strategy that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and then commit to working on just one of those chunks for a short period of time - say 25 minutes. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and more achievable. After your 25 minutes are up, take a 5-minute break to do something you enjoy, like scrolling Reddit or watching a funny video. Then, come back to your task and repeat the process. This is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can be a really effective way to build focus and momentum. Additionally, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're procrastinating - are you feeling overwhelmed, bored, or anxious about your schoolwork? Once you understand what's driving your procrastination, you can start to develop strategies to address those underlying issues. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track. You've already taken a big step by recognizing your procrastination habit and seeking help, so that's something to be proud of!","Hey, I totally get it. Procrastination in high school is super common. It sounds like you're already aware of the problem, which is the first step! Alarms can be tough because it's easy to just snooze them.

Instead of focusing on huge blocks of work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Basically, you work in focused 25-minute intervals with short 5-minute breaks in between. After four ""pomodoros,"" you take a longer break (like 20-30 minutes). There are tons of free apps and websites that can help you time it. The short bursts of work can feel less overwhelming and make it easier to get started.

Also, try to identify *why* you're procrastinating. Is the work boring? Too hard? If it's boring, can you make it more interesting somehow (e.g., listen to music while you work, study with a friend)? If it's too hard, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Don't aim for perfection right away, just aim to get *something* done. Even 5 minutes of progress is better than nothing!

t3_r6dzl7,[Need Advice] How do I give 100% everyday no matter how I feel?,"In my life, I completely focus on my goals: studying and training, that's all I do all day everyday; however sometimes I feel really destroyed, maybe I miss sleep cause of studying or I get injured cause of boxing and it all drains my energy and it makes me feel less disciplined. Sometimes happens that I do other things instead of keep focusing on studying, for instance I take me phone and starting playing games or just chilling with me friends without doing something that is more useful. I want to fully live my life, completely dedicating and committing myself into hard work and discipline, often I don't even do as much I know I can do tho. I truly need help, any advices????","100/100 = 100%

50/50 = 100%

Make sense? Each day's ""100%"" will fluctuate.","In my opinion, this isn't feasible. Life is life. Shit's going to happen. You'll have days your on point and days you're not. A simple example is working out - you're going to have some really awesome workouts that you're stoked to do, have energy, and just hammer it. Other days you'll have less energy or not be as into it.

What you can focus on is discipline. This would be doing that workout no matter what. Tired? Do it. Sick? Within reason, do it. Not motivated? Do it.","Hey there! It sounds like you're really committed to your goals, which is awesome. But remember, giving 100% every single day isn't about pushing yourself to the brink. It's about consistency and balance. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Prioritize Rest and Recovery**: Your body and mind need downtime to function at their best. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking breaks to prevent burnout. This will actually help you be more productive in the long run.

2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break your big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This way, you can focus on making steady progress without feeling overwhelmed.

3. **Schedule Downtime**: It's okay to relax and have fun. Schedule time for activities you enjoy, like hanging out with friends or playing games. This can help recharge your energy and keep you motivated.

4. **Stay Flexible**: Life happens, and sometimes you need to adjust your plans. Be kind to yourself if things don't go perfectly. It's all part of the process.

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly check in with yourself to see what's working and what isn't. Adjust your strategies as needed to keep moving forward.

Remember, discipline is about building sustainable habits, not just pushing through exhaustion. Keep at it, and you'll find a rhythm that works for you!","Hey there - I want to challenge the premise that giving 100% every single day is actually sustainable or healthy. Even elite athletes have rest and recovery periods built into their training schedules. The key to long-term discipline isn't about maintaining maximum intensity 24/7, but rather about consistency and smart pacing.

It sounds like you're burning yourself out by trying to maintain an unsustainable pace between studying and boxing. When you crash and end up gaming or hanging with friends, that's your body and mind desperately seeking recovery time. Instead of viewing this as a failure of discipline, try building these breaks intentionally into your schedule.

Try this approach: Plan your week with dedicated focus blocks for studying and training, but also schedule specific recovery periods. During those recovery times, you can guilt-free enjoy gaming or socializing, knowing it's part of your overall strategy rather than a lapse in discipline. This way you're working with your body's natural rhythms instead of fighting against them.

The most disciplined people aren't the ones who never rest - they're the ones who understand that strategic rest makes their focused work time more effective. Start viewing discipline as playing the long game rather than trying to sprint a marathon. Your goal should be maintaining consistent progress over months and years, not burning bright for a few weeks and then crashing.

Remember: Discipline isn't about being perfect every day - it's about showing up consistently over time, even if some days are at 70% rather than 100%.","It's great that you're recognizing your potential and wanting to push yourself to give 100% every day. First, it's essential to understand that it's okay to not feel 100% every day - it's normal to have off days due to lack of sleep or injury. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect. 

One strategy you could try is to set realistic daily goals for yourself, taking into account how you're feeling physically and mentally. For example, if you're injured, maybe your goal for the day is to do some light stretching or watch instructional videos related to boxing instead of pushing through a tough workout. Similarly, if you're feeling exhausted from studying, maybe your goal is to review notes for a shorter period than usual.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax, like spending time with friends or playing games. While it might seem counterintuitive, taking breaks and doing things you enjoy can actually help you recharge and come back to your goals with more focus and energy.

Another thing to consider is the concept of ""good enough."" Some days, good enough might mean putting in 50% effort instead of 100%, but still making progress towards your goals. It's better to consistently make small strides than to burn out trying to be perfect every day. Remember, discipline is about consistency and patience, not about being flawless all the time.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're pushing yourself really hard, which is admirable, but also a recipe for burnout if you're not careful.

First, 100% every day isn't realistic or sustainable. Think of discipline more like a dimmer switch than an on/off one. Some days you'll be at 100%, others at 60%, and that's okay. The key is consistency over time, not perfection every single day.

Second, recovery is part of the process, not a break from it. Sleep isn't a luxury; it's essential for studying and training. The same goes for managing injuries. If you're injured, pushing through will only make it worse. Prioritize rest and rehab. Think of it as investing in your future performance.

Third, those ""useless"" moments with friends or playing games? They might be more useful than you think. Downtime is crucial for mental health and preventing burnout. Schedule it in! Instead of feeling guilty about it, plan for it. Maybe allocate an hour or two on certain days to relax and recharge.

Finally, when you find yourself drifting towards distractions, try to identify the trigger. Are you bored? Stressed? Tired? Once you know the trigger, you can develop a strategy to deal with it. Maybe it's a quick walk, a healthy snack, or a short meditation session.

You're already dedicated and committed, now it's about being smart about how you channel that energy. Good luck!

t3_we9g68,[Need Advice] Weed and Discipline,"So I (24M) have come to enjoy weed over the past three years quite a bit.

I consider myself a very disciplined person, even while smoking.

I have a full time job and a handful of rental properties as another source of income. I workout 4-5 times a week.

But I can’t help but feel guilty while smoking that I “could be doing more”. The reality is I feel that while doing anything other than grinding.

Weed helps me do the tasks at work or at my business that are boring or that I keep kicking down the road. 

Im proud of what I’ve accomplished and keep coming to the conclusion that if I can smoke weed and still get my tasks done for the day I shouldn’t be stressing too much about it.

But still after the initial high I feel guilty and start asking myself “Do you think your competition is high right now?” Even though I’m literally working while having that thought.

I’d love to hear what you guys think.","I know exactly what you mean and have dealt with this myself. 

Stop for a week or two and see how you feel. 

In my case, when I stopped smoking it definitely helped me be more productive. I still like to smoke at night after work, but find that I’m more productive (and less anxious) while working now.

Edit: also be careful with smoking too much, it can mask what’s “really happening” because it “feels” good to smoke. 

Recently I developed a stomach condition that I didn’t realize I initially had. Basically eating food has been hard, and I’ll throw up food almost immediately. Sorry if it’s TMI lol 

Point is, took me a while to figure out what was happening because weed was making it easier to eat. But was also aggravating my stomach more, and making the issue worse. 

So your body might be telling you something.  Stop for bit and see how you feel. Overall though, you really don’t want to be using weed to get by the “boring” stuff. Use it to enjoy the good stuff even more. Although it’s technically not an addictive substance, it can become habit forming.",A doctor didn’t need to tell me weed was making it easier to eat 😂 It was pretty noticeable when I wasn’t throwing up,"It sounds like you're doing a great job balancing your responsibilities and personal enjoyment, which is no small feat. Feeling guilty about downtime or leisure activities is pretty common, especially for driven people. One thing to consider is setting clear boundaries for when you work and when you relax. If weed helps you tackle mundane tasks, maybe designate specific times for it, ensuring it doesn't bleed into moments when you want to be more focused or competitive. Also, remember that rest and relaxation are crucial for long-term productivity and mental health. It's okay to enjoy your downtime without guilt, especially if you're meeting your goals. Keep evaluating your habits and adjust as needed, but give yourself credit for what you've achieved so far.","It sounds like you've built some impressive discipline and achievements already - managing properties, staying fit, and handling a full-time job is no small feat. The guilt you're feeling seems less about weed impacting your productivity (since you're still getting things done) and more about comparing yourself to hypothetical competition.

Here's the thing: your ""competition"" might be drinking alcohol, binge watching Netflix, or doing any number of other activities in their downtime. What matters is your results and whether your habits are serving or hindering your goals.

That said, it's worth examining why you need weed specifically to tackle boring tasks. While it's currently working for you, developing strategies to handle tedious work without chemical assistance could make you more adaptable long-term. Maybe try experimenting with other focusing techniques like the Pomodoro method or task batching for those boring tasks.

Consider tracking your productivity and goal progress with and without weed for a few weeks. Hard data might help quiet that guilty voice, or reveal areas where cutting back could genuinely benefit you. Either way, you'll be making decisions based on your actual performance rather than assumptions about what you ""should"" be doing.

Remember - discipline isn't about constant grinding. It's about sustainable systems that help you achieve your goals while maintaining balance in your life.","It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of self-doubt and guilt despite being a high-achieving individual. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing your accomplishments and taking pride in them - that's not always easy to do. It's also interesting that you mention weed helps you tackle boring or procrastinated tasks, which suggests it might be serving as a tool for focus or creativity for you. Rather than beating yourself up over whether you ""could be doing more,"" maybe try reframing your thinking around what works for you and what doesn't. If smoking weed isn't negatively impacting your productivity or responsibilities, perhaps it's not worth the guilt trip. Consider setting clear goals and priorities for yourself, both personally and professionally, and then evaluate how your habits - including weed use - align with those goals. By focusing on what you want to achieve and tracking your progress, you might find that the guilt subsides and you can enjoy your downtime without the nagging voice of self-doubt.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a pretty good spot overall, juggling a job, rentals, and workouts. That's a lot! It's understandable to feel that ""could be doing more"" guilt, especially when weed is involved.

Maybe try reframing your thinking. Instead of focusing on what your competition *might* be doing, focus on tracking your own productivity and progress. If you're consistently hitting your goals while smoking, that's data you can use to quiet that nagging voice.

You could also experiment with *when* you smoke. If it helps you tackle boring tasks, maybe reserve it specifically for those times, rather than making it an all-day thing. That way, it's a tool, not a default state.

Finally, consider what ""doing more"" actually *means* to you. Is it more money? More free time? More impact? Once you define that, you can assess whether weed is truly hindering you from reaching those specific goals, or if it's just a general feeling of unease. Good luck!

t3_12zzoi6,[Need Advice] How to fix attention Span,So unfortunately I used to no life tiktok and now my attention span is in the dust. I can't focus for longer than 10 minutes which is severely affecting my studies and my passion. Anything I can do to fix it?,"Get off your phone. I'm using an app that makes my phone text based instead of icons. It also closes Reddit ( or any other app) after 10min. Finally, started reading books again. It's been about a month and I definitely feel my attention span has improved.

Edit: app is Minimalist Phone","Ha, my 10 min really was up. It's called Minimalist Phone.","Hey there! It’s great that you’re looking to improve your attention span. Here are a few steps you can try to get back on track. First, consider setting specific times for using apps like TikTok and stick to them. You can use app timers or digital wellbeing features on your phone to help with this. Next, try the Pomodoro Technique for studying—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help gradually increase your focus. Also, make sure to take care of your physical health: regular exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep can significantly impact your concentration. Lastly, practice mindfulness or meditation, even just for a few minutes a day, to help train your brain to focus better. Remember, it’s a process, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!","Hey there - recovering from a short attention span is definitely possible with consistent effort. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:

Start by deleting TikTok completely. The app is literally designed to fragment your focus, so keeping it around while trying to rebuild attention is like trying to quit sugar while keeping candy in your pocket.

Then gradually rebuild your focus through progressive training. Set a timer for 15 minutes and try to focus on one task (reading, studying, etc). No phone, no distractions. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the task. It's like building a muscle - you have to start where you are and slowly work up.

After a week, bump it to 20 minutes. Then 25, then 30. The Pomodoro Technique (25 min work/5 min break) is a great target to work toward.

Replace TikTok time with activities that build sustained attention: reading physical books, doing puzzles, or practicing a skill related to your passion. Even simple things like taking a shower without your phone or eating a meal without screens help retrain your brain for longer focus periods.

The first few days will feel uncomfortable - that's normal and temporary. Your brain is literally rewiring itself. Stick with it for 2-3 weeks and you'll notice significant improvements in your ability to concentrate on studies and passion projects.","Fixing your attention span takes time and practice, but it's definitely possible. One strategy you could try is the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the length of your focused periods. It might also be helpful to identify and eliminate distractions while you're working, like turning off your phone or finding a quiet space. Additionally, incorporating activities that require sustained attention, such as reading or puzzles, into your daily routine could help improve your focus over time. It's also worth considering taking regular breaks from social media, especially TikTok, to give your brain a chance to reset and rebuild its ability to focus. Start small and be patient with yourself - it's like rebuilding a muscle that's been out of use for a while.","Hey, I've been there! TikTok (and similar stuff) can really mess with your focus. It's definitely fixable though, just takes some effort.

First, cold turkey on TikTok is probably the best starting point. Delete the app, block the website, whatever it takes to make it harder to access.

Then, start small with your studies and passion projects. Don't try to jump back into hours of focus right away. Try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Gradually increase the work intervals as you get better at concentrating.

Also, think about *why* you were on TikTok so much. Were you bored? Stressed? Find healthier ways to deal with those feelings. Exercise, reading (actual books!), spending time with friends, learning a new skill – anything that engages you without the instant gratification of short-form video.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It takes time to rebuild your attention span. Don't get discouraged if you slip up. Just get back on track as soon as you can. You got this!

t3_uq0ne1,Sugar\junk food addiction [need advice],"Hey guys I’ve been eating sugar since I was little I’m 16 now, I’ve been getting rid of bad habits and addictions but I can’t seem to escape junk food I don’t wanna remove sugar completely but I do wanna avoid high sugar/ highly processed foods. Any advice, I’ve been eating the crap on the daily a Lenny & Lerry protein cookie chocolate chip to be exact, some kind of candy and chips. I really wanna detox my body from the crap I’ve been eating for years now, I exercise 3 times a week (full body) but I really wanna clean up my diet and kick this addiction. Ps I’m plant based  if anyone cares.


Edit: thank you guys for the advice I need to work on my self discipline more that’s for sure. And also I’m in the process of learning how to cook for myself more because sometimes my mom is really busy. Also I picked up some fruit today & I just wanna thank everyone for all the helpful advice and have a great week!","IMHO, the best investment a 16 year old can make is to learn cooking, you'll semi-automatically eat more fresh food. There's no unnecessarily complicated calorie counting, or reading food labels, or whatever fad-diet rules. You simply buy fresh veggies, fruits, nuts, etc. cook it, eat it. 

As a side effect, you'll save money, spend it to learn other skills, or even invest them. When you're young, time is your best friend, so play the long game.",I can’t access a gym unfortunately that’s why I do full body calisthenics 3x pre week but for everything else I appreciate the input!,"Hey! It's awesome that you're taking steps to clean up your diet and build better habits. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Gradual Changes**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try reducing your intake gradually. This can make the transition easier and more sustainable.

2. **Healthy Swaps**: Since you're plant-based, there are tons of delicious alternatives to junk food. Try swapping your protein cookie for a homemade energy ball or a piece of fruit with nut butter. For chips, roasted chickpeas or kale chips can be a crunchy alternative.

3. **Meal Prep**: Learning to cook is a great skill, and meal prepping can save you time and help you avoid reaching for junk food. Start with simple recipes and gradually build your skills.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to when and why you reach for junk food. Sometimes it's out of habit or boredom. Being mindful can help you make more conscious choices.

5. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes cravings can be confused with thirst. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You're already on the right track by exercising and making these changes. Keep it up, and good luck!","Great job recognizing this habit and wanting to make a change! Since you're already exercising regularly, cleaning up your diet is a natural next step. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, which rarely works with sugar, try gradually replacing your current snacks with healthier alternatives. For example, when you're craving something sweet, reach for dates, berries, or a banana with nut butter. These will satisfy your sweet tooth while providing actual nutrients.

Since you're plant-based, you might want to try making your own protein snacks. There are tons of recipes online for homemade protein balls using dates, nuts, and plant protein powder. They can be just as satisfying as those store-bought cookies but without all the processed ingredients.

The key is to make small, sustainable changes. Maybe start by replacing just one processed snack per day with a whole food alternative. Once that feels normal, tackle another. Keep healthy snacks readily available and visible - it's much easier to make good choices when they're right in front of you.

Also, drinking more water throughout the day can help reduce cravings. Sometimes what we interpret as a sugar craving is actually thirst. Keep a water bottle with you and stay hydrated.

Remember that slip-ups are normal when changing any habit. Don't beat yourself up if you have a day where you eat more junk food than planned - just get back on track the next day. You've already shown great discipline with your exercise routine, and you can absolutely apply that same dedication to improving your diet.","It's great that you're recognizing the need to cut back on high sugar and processed foods, especially given your regular exercise routine. Since you're plant-based, exploring healthy alternatives like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits can be a good starting point to curb your junk food cravings. Considering you've just started learning how to cook for yourself, try simple recipes that incorporate these ingredients. For instance, you could make your own energy balls using oats, nuts, and dried fruits as a healthier substitute for store-bought protein cookies. Also, having a bowl of fruit at home can be a great reminder to reach for something natural when you feel like snacking. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection - start by replacing one unhealthy snack with a healthier option each day and see how that goes. Keep in mind that developing self-discipline is a process, and it sounds like you're on the right track by acknowledging its importance and taking small steps towards cooking more for yourself. Good luck on your journey to cleaner eating!","Hey! It's awesome you're tackling this at 16 – that's seriously proactive. Cutting back on sugar and processed foods is a great goal. Since you're plant-based, focusing on whole foods will be your best bet.

Instead of going cold turkey (which can be tough), try swapping out those Lenny & Larry's cookies, candy, and chips gradually. Maybe replace the cookie with a piece of fruit and a handful of nuts. For the chips, try making your own baked sweet potato chips or air-popped popcorn. Small changes add up!

Since you're already exercising, that's a huge plus. Maybe try to link your workouts to your food goals. Like, ""I'm going to crush this workout so I can fuel my body with something healthy afterward.""

Also, since you mentioned your mom is busy, learning to cook some simple plant-based meals will give you a lot more control over what you're eating. There are tons of easy recipes online. Even just mastering a simple stir-fry or lentil soup can make a big difference.

Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You got this!

t3_rkmp8s,[Need Advice] How not to sleep/be lazy in the daytime during Winters,"I was asked to leave my job last year Nov 2020 due to inconsistent performance at the job because I'd fall asleep in the day during winters. I thought it was due to a sudden change from Nightshift job to Dayshift job (Both WFH). Summers went well, I somewhat made a routine, followed it, not completely disciplined but I at least saw some difference in myself.

Now winters are back and it's been a month I have been messing up again. I am back to night shift job but I delay my work I don't know why. I feel very cold and get in the blankets, if I wear 2-3 layers of clothing I feel irritated and itching on the head, cheeks and back.

Please help me with this. Appreciate every small and big help.  
Also, Merry Xmas and HNY to everyone.","There are a few things you can do.

First, what's the ambient temperature of your house? I'm not asking what it says on the thermostat, but instead what it actually is inside the house. You may consider raising the temperature a little.

Second, light is important. People design their offices for low energy and for being sleepy. Put in 100 watt natural daylight LED bulbs in your office space. You should have 2 or 3 of them. Turn up your monitor brightness. You might even consider putting your lights on a timer. I have the lights in my bedroom come on automatically right after 7:00. Again, I am using natural daylight hue and I have the brightest LED panel fixture I could get. When the lights come on, it's a bright sunny day. The light helps you to wake up.

Third, make sure you are getting decent sleep. You need to eat your meals and go to bed then get up at a consistent time every day - even the weekends. You want to aim for 8 hours.

There are a few other things.  A light, protein and fiber heavy meal first thing in the morning with a bit of coffee will really get you going. I'm talking 200 calories or less - something like a hardboiled egg, a protein bar, some lunchmeat, something like that. Absolutely no sugar or carbs though unless you want to have a blood sugar crash later.

It sounds to me also like you are having some dry skin issues. After showering, I would recommend slapping on some moisturizer. Use something water based. Apply daily everywhere, then to the exposed surfaces a few more times through the day, and to your hands after each time you wash them.","In addition to the temperature and lighting mentioned by other posters, consider taking vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency can make you tired and is usually worse during the winter. 

I'd also recommend getting checked for basic vitamin levels and thyroid etc by your doctor because your fatigue seems to be impacting your daily life. They can give you more specific recommendations and make sure you don't go overboard.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a tough combo of winter blues and a challenging work schedule. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Light Exposure**: Try to get as much natural light as possible during the day. If that's tough, consider a light therapy lamp. It can help regulate your sleep cycle and boost your mood.

2. **Layer Smartly**: Instead of piling on heavy clothes, try thermal layers that are designed to keep you warm without the bulk. Also, consider using a space heater to keep your workspace cozy without needing to bundle up too much.

3. **Movement Breaks**: Set a timer to remind yourself to get up and move every hour. Even a quick stretch or a short walk around your home can help keep you alert.

4. **Hydration and Nutrition**: Sometimes feeling sluggish can be linked to dehydration or not eating enough. Make sure you're drinking water and eating balanced meals.

5. **Routine Adjustments**: Since you're back on night shifts, try to create a consistent routine that aligns with your work hours. This might mean adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you're getting enough rest.

Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Good luck, and happy holidays!","Hey there - this sounds really challenging, especially since it's affected your work performance in the past. The good news is that winter sleepiness is pretty common and there are several practical ways to combat it.

First, for the physical discomfort: Instead of piling on multiple layers that make you itchy, try getting a single high-quality thermal base layer (like merino wool which is non-itchy) and one warm outer layer. This will keep you warm without the bulk and irritation.

For fighting daytime sleepiness, environment makes a huge difference. Keep your workspace well-lit - consider getting a SAD lamp that mimics sunlight. They're especially helpful during winter months. Also, try to work in a cooler room (around 65-68°F/18-20°C) - being too warm makes sleepiness worse.

Movement is key. Set an alarm every hour to get up and do some quick exercises - jumping jacks, stretches, or even just walking around for 2-3 minutes. This helps wake up your body and mind.

Since you're on night shift, make sure you're keeping a consistent sleep schedule even on days off. Your body needs that routine. Also, try taking a Vitamin D supplement (after checking with your doctor) since you're probably getting less sunlight exposure.

Start small - pick just one or two of these suggestions to implement first. Maybe begin with the movement breaks and consistent sleep schedule. Once those become habit, add another change. Small, consistent steps are more sustainable than trying to change everything at once.","It sounds like you're struggling with a combination of factors that are making it tough for you to stay on track during winters. First, let's tackle the physical discomfort - have you considered using a humidifier to reduce dryness in the air, which might be contributing to the itching sensation? Additionally, you could try layering up with breathable fabrics like cotton or merino wool, which might be less irritating than synthetic materials.

In terms of staying awake and focused during the day, establishing a consistent routine can really help. Since you've had some success with this in the past, try to build on that momentum. Set specific times for waking up, working, and taking breaks, and stick to them as much as possible. It might also be helpful to get some morning sunlight exposure, even if it's just for a few minutes - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms.

Given your history of falling asleep during the day, it might be worth exploring ways to stay active and engaged during your waking hours. This could be as simple as taking a short walk outside, doing some light stretching, or practicing some mindfulness exercises. Finally, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day - this can help you build momentum and stay motivated, even when the winter blues are getting you down. Remember that it's okay to start small and work your way up - every little bit counts, and it's great that you're reaching out for support.","Hey, that sounds really frustrating, especially after making progress in the summer. It's tough when seasonal changes throw a wrench in things.

A couple of thoughts: First, the cold and the clothing irritation sound like they need addressing directly. Maybe experiment with different fabrics (merino wool is often recommended for warmth without itchiness) or try a heated blanket/pad just for your workspace to keep you warm without needing layers. Addressing the physical discomfort might make a bigger difference than you think.

Second, regarding delaying work, even though you're back on night shift, your body might still be adjusting to the winter daylight hours. Try to get some bright light exposure early in your shift (or even before, if possible). A SAD lamp could be helpful. Also, break down your work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have to do this huge project,"" think ""I'll just work on this one small task for 25 minutes."" The Pomodoro Technique can be really useful for that.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to slip up, especially with seasonal changes. Just acknowledge it, figure out what triggered it, and get back on track. Don't let a few bad days turn into a bad month. Good luck, you got this!

t3_oj721a,[Need Advice] Undergrad thesis due in 3 days,"This is my first post on here.

Background - I am in the final year of my undergraduate BA degree. I have always been a consistent student in all my previous semesters. Handed my assignments and term papers on time, Got mostly A's and sometimes B's, Managed to maintain an above average CGPA of 8.5 and above.

Situation right now - I have submitted all my assignments and papers for my final semester, except for a 10,000 word thesis which is due in 2 days. This was initially supposed to be submitted in May, but I got an extension as I could not submit it at the time. My grandmother, my parents and sister all got covid, and given everything that has been happening, I couldn't focus on any of my academic submissions. The quality of my submissions has also gone down, as I am aware. 
In the previous semester, I had also managed to submit my final papers a few weeks after I had a surgery and got A's in all of them, but I just haven't been able to do anything this semester.
This is probably the last extension I have gotten, and even now, I was not able to work at all. Neither did I have the motivation to, nor the willpower. I have also been having suicidal thoughts since the last 6 months, and I know that I am not okay.

Yesterday, I saw a lot my batchmates post on social media about their online graduation and that they finished their degree and I have been anxious ever since about failing now.
Our college won't provide the option of taking a break year and continuing, nor will I have support from my family, so I have to finish this, no matter what. After being so close, I don't want to give up, but don't know what to do because of my mental health.

Thesis work done: I have written around 4,000 words, done 80% of my research. I have 2 chapters left to write, and then editing and proofreading them.

Any advice, motivation or even personal experiences with similar University situations are welcome.
I know that everyone is going through a very difficult time right now, and I am probably in a much better environment compared to that.

Thank you so much!","You’ve got two days. 48 hours. You can do this. You say you’ve done 4000 words, you can finish this. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Seriously. It just has to be done. Maybe you won’t be able to proofread the way you normally would, or write it to a standard you’re used to. The fact is, and this is the most important part…you just have to sit down and do it. 

You can do this. 

The stress of not having it done, and not working on it while the clock is ticking away is causing you more distress. Honest fact. I have faith that you can do this. 

Sit down. Break up the next 48 hours into 12 chunks. In each chunk, write 500 words. Set a timer. When 500 is done, take a break, take a walk, stare at a wall. Whatever it takes. 

Put away phones and other distractions. Set yourself up and commit to writing the first 500 word chunk. You will feel better. 

You can do this.","Honestly...you're just delaying it even further. 

The time it took you to think of posting this and then writing it up would have easily got you over the half way point on your assignment.

There is no magic secret or sauce. The fact all your other assignments were on time means you're not a procrastinator at all. This is the final assignment and the fear and anxiety of this all being finished and real life after school starting had delayed you this far and because you sound like you're not used to last second work you're dealing with further delayism.

Only answer here is. Doing several back to back distraction free working sessions. With small breaks in between. Your Research is mostly done these focus work sessions will just put it all together. 

It's not going to do it itself. Reddit cannot give you motivation. Don't let anxiety and fear waste 4 years of hard work. 

Justttttt dooooooo itttttttt","Hey there! First off, it's really impressive that you've managed to keep up such a strong academic record despite everything that's been going on. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but you've already done a lot of the heavy lifting with your thesis. Here’s a plan that might help you push through these last few days:

1. **Break it Down**: You’ve got 6,000 words to go. Try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Maybe aim for 1,000 words at a time. It’s less daunting and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each section.

2. **Set a Schedule**: Allocate specific blocks of time for writing, and stick to them. Use a timer to focus for 25-30 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This is known as the Pomodoro Technique and can help maintain your focus and energy.

3. **Prioritize**: Focus on getting the main content down first. You can refine and edit later. It’s more important to have a complete draft than a perfect one at this stage.

4. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to your advisor or a professor. They might offer guidance or even a bit of leniency if they understand your situation.

5. **Self-Care**: Remember to take care of yourself. Short walks, deep breathing, or even a quick chat with a friend can help clear your mind and reduce anxiety.

6. **Professional Help**: Given your mention of suicidal thoughts, it’s crucial to reach out to a mental health professional. Many universities offer counseling services, and there are hotlines available that can provide immediate support.

You’re so close to the finish line. Just take it one step at a time, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help. You’ve got this!","First off, you're not alone in this situation - thesis deadlines and family health crises are incredibly tough, especially combined. But let's focus on what's doable in these next few days.

You've actually completed a significant chunk already - 4000 words and 80% of research is a solid foundation. The remaining 6000 words across 2 chapters is absolutely achievable in 2-3 days, even if it's not your best work ever. Remember, done is better than perfect right now.

Here's a concrete plan: Break down the remaining work into 6 blocks of 1000 words each. That's roughly 3-4 hours per block if you include basic editing. Set up a distraction-free workspace and use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused writing followed by 5-minute breaks.

Start with outlining your remaining chapters in detail. Then tackle one 1000-word block at a time. Don't edit while writing - just get the words down first. Leave the final day for editing and proofreading everything.

Regarding your mental health - please reach out to your university's counseling services right after submitting this thesis. They often have emergency appointments available. You've shown incredible resilience handling surgery and family illness while studying - you can get through this too.

For immediate motivation: You're literally days away from completing your degree. Your track record shows you're more than capable of this - you've maintained an 8.5 CGPA and handled tough situations before. This is your final push.

Take it one block at a time. You've got this.","Given your situation, it's crucial to break down the remaining work into manageable chunks. With 2 days left and 6,000 words to go, plus editing and proofreading, it's tight but not impossible. Focus on completing one chapter at a time, and don't worry too much about perfection at this stage - you can refine later. 

Since you've mentioned having suicidal thoughts, please ensure you're reaching out for support. Your university might have resources like counseling services that can offer immediate help, even if it's just a conversation to get through the next couple of days. It's okay to not be okay, and acknowledging this is a huge step.

Your past achievements show you're capable of pushing through difficult times, like after your surgery. While this semester has been uniquely challenging, drawing on that resilience can help. Remember, it's not about being motivated or having willpower right now; it's about taking it one step at a time. 

Lastly, try to limit your social media use for the next 48 hours to reduce anxiety triggers. You've got this far, and finishing this thesis, even if it's not perfect, is achievable. Once you're through this, prioritize getting help for your mental health - you don't have to go through this alone.","Hey, that sounds like a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. First off, it's great that you've already written 4,000 words and done 80% of the research – that's a solid foundation to build on.

Given the time crunch, let's focus on getting this done. Forget about perfection right now. Aim for ""good enough"" to pass. Break down those remaining two chapters into smaller, manageable chunks. Think in terms of 500-word mini-goals. Can you knock out one of those every few hours?

Prioritize sleep and food. Seriously. Pulling all-nighters fueled by caffeine will likely backfire. Even a short nap can do wonders.

Since you're struggling with motivation, try the ""5-minute rule."" Tell yourself you'll work on the thesis for just 5 minutes. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going.

Also, don't be afraid to lean on resources. Can you email your professor and briefly explain the situation? Even if they can't grant another extension, they might offer some guidance on prioritizing what needs to be done.

Most importantly, please reach out for help regarding the suicidal thoughts. Your university likely has counseling services, and there are also resources like the Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Your mental health is paramount, and getting support is crucial. You've overcome challenges before, and you can get through this too. Focus on one small step at a time, and remember that finishing this thesis is within your reach. Good luck!

t3_10ix3h3,[need advice] How do you stop running or avoiding tasks that gives you anxiety?,"

Has anyone ever felt like avoiding situations or tasks that’s need to be completed but kept on avoiding because it gives you anxiety and suddenly get into the habit of proscnatation. I’ve been avoiding my college classes lately because my grades are bad despite the amount of work I do. I don’t understand how to be calm and stop being frustrating with any recent grades or assignments .
Easily getting overwhlemed and all I think and worry is about life and college and stuff but even I worry about my college academics in back of my head but I just keep on avoiding even though I regret every min of it. Sighs I feel mentally and emotionally exhausted","Honestly, the only thing that has ever helped me is facing the thing that I don’t want to do. You do that with whatever supports you need, but ultimately, taking the thing on stops the the anxiety. Even if you don’t finish the task at hand at least you chipped away at it and now the job is smaller than it was before. 

I’m sure you’ve seen all over this sub that procrastination is a form of escapism. It’s true, and as you know from experience, it’s usually because we want to avoid feeling bad. **The truth is you will feel badly in this life.** You have to choose if the bad feelings are going to be because of fear/anxiety or because your going through the growth process.

I’m a school teacher who also has anxiety. School is hard. Remember, you’re not the only person to struggle in school and it has absolutely nothing to do with your value or your future that you’re finding college challenging. 

I tell my students all the time that learning hurts. You can do it anyway. Come up with a plan to make things surmountable then enact any strategies that help you along the way. There is nothing wrong with using supports (friends, tutors, study groups, YouTube videos that break subjects down more clearly than professors etc). The idea is that you get to the finish line. **Take control and choose your pain.**  

All of that said, talk nicely to yourself and don’t feel like you need to have everything perfect right away. Life, learning, coping etc are all processes. Be reasonable with yourself.","It's painful to sit and study. But it's more painful to not study and slip into anxiety for not having finished the tasks. You choose your pain based on what's less painful. You take the easy way out. To me, the pain of discipline hurts less than the pain of regret. Choose wisely.","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Break it Down**: When tasks feel overwhelming, try breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces. Focus on completing just one small part at a time. This can make things feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you tick things off.

2. **Set a Routine**: Establishing a daily routine can help create a sense of normalcy and control. Try setting specific times for studying, breaks, and relaxation. Consistency can help reduce anxiety over time.

3. **Prioritize Self-Care**: Make sure you're taking care of your mental and physical health. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep can significantly impact your stress levels and overall well-being.

4. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to your professors or academic advisors. They can offer guidance and may provide resources to help you improve your grades. Also, consider talking to a counselor if you're feeling overwhelmed; they can offer strategies to manage anxiety.

5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, but taking small steps can help you regain control. You've got this!","Hey there - what you're describing is a really common cycle with anxiety and avoidance. The more we avoid something, the scarier it becomes, which makes us avoid it more. But there are ways to break this pattern.

Start incredibly small. Instead of thinking ""I need to catch up on all my classes,"" pick ONE tiny task. Maybe it's just opening your textbook for 5 minutes, or reviewing one lecture slide. The key is making it so small that it feels almost ridiculous to not do it.

For dealing with the anxiety itself, try the ""5-4-3-2-1"" grounding technique when you're feeling overwhelmed: Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring you back to the present moment when anxiety is spiraling.

Also, consider talking to your professors or academic advisor. Many students are dealing with similar struggles, and there might be resources or accommodations available to help you get back on track. You don't have to figure this out alone.

Remember that avoiding tasks doesn't make them go away - it just adds the weight of guilt and anxiety on top of the original task. Taking even tiny steps forward will help build momentum and confidence. You've already shown awareness by reaching out here, which is a great first step.","It sounds like you're caught in a vicious cycle of anxiety and avoidance, which is really common when we're facing stressful situations like poor grades despite our best efforts. One strategy that might help is to break down the tasks or situations that are causing you anxiety into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of thinking ""I need to get my college grades back on track,"" try focusing on a single assignment or task that you've been putting off, and make a plan to tackle it in a specific, limited timeframe. This can help make the task feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, consider setting aside dedicated time to worry about your grades and college academics - this might sound counterintuitive, but giving yourself permission to worry for a set amount of time each day (say, 10-15 minutes) can actually help you feel more in control and able to focus on other things during the rest of the day. Lastly, remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that seeking help from a counselor or academic advisor can be a great way to get support and develop strategies for managing anxiety and staying on top of your coursework.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you're caught in a loop of anxiety, avoidance, and then more anxiety about avoiding things.

One thing that might help is breaking down those big, scary tasks into *tiny*, manageable steps. Instead of thinking ""I have to catch up on all my classes,"" try ""I'm going to watch just 15 minutes of one lecture."" Seriously, just 15 minutes. The goal isn't to finish everything, it's just to *start*. Often, once you get going, it's easier to keep going.

Also, be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. College is stressful! Maybe try scheduling in some dedicated ""worry time"" – like 15 minutes a day where you allow yourself to think about all the things stressing you out. Then, when those thoughts pop up at other times, you can tell yourself, ""I'll think about that during my worry time later."" It sounds weird, but it can help contain the anxiety.

Finally, and this is important, consider talking to your college's counseling services. They're there to help students with exactly these kinds of issues. They can offer strategies and support tailored to your specific situation. You're not alone in this, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Good luck, you got this!

t3_11dy1f0,[Need Advice] How to be concentrated when working from home?,"It is always a lot of distraction when I am working from home. My kid, my husband, food, cat... I use pomodoro method for 25 mins, but it is always something distractive and I can't concentrate. Please advice.","Changing your environment is the biggest factor, like converting an out of the way room or closet into an office.

Noise-cancelling headphones also help.","Have a designated area where you only to work. Isolate yourself from all distractions - sights, phones, passersby. Set Focus Hours on your phone if you can. Schedule out your work for the day at the beginning of the day. Make sure your husband knows that you're ""at work"" during these times.

Try a standing desk - I get lethargic sitting all day. Find a type of music that focuses you. Get solid sleep, eat well, and drink water. If your mind refuses to focus, do some exercises for 5 minutes - it will increase blood flow and the brain can actually burn lactic acid for energy. Edit: the brain doesn't burn it, it actually triggers norepinephrine, which is a hormone that encourages focus, affects our stress response, improves memory, and relates some bodily functions that can become distractions (bathroom, hunger). So first, get moving. Format exercise, dancing to music while working, 5 quick crunches and push ups, anything. Reading this journal entry, lethargy shifts you to  essentially half-asleepness.

Take stringent notes on what you're distracted by, then chill out and reflect on that list to find ways to intercept those distracted spirals, prevent the distractions in the first place, or set up some ""give and take"" to not go full cold turkey.

Ultimately you may need to see someone if it doesn't improve. I was diagnosed with ADHD ""inattentive type"" - though always suspected it - last year at 32. Fuck do those stimulants help. Being out of a ""work only"" location was a tough adjustment.

[Spaceship You - CGP GREY](https://youtu.be/snAhsXyO3Ck)","Working from home can definitely be a challenge with all the distractions around. Here are a few strategies that might help you focus better. First, try setting up a dedicated workspace if you haven't already. Even a small corner can make a big difference in creating a mental boundary between work and home life. Communicate with your family about your work hours and the importance of minimizing interruptions during those times. You might also want to experiment with noise-cancelling headphones or background music to help drown out distractions. If the Pomodoro method isn't working as well as you'd like, consider adjusting the time intervals to see if longer or shorter periods work better for you. Lastly, don't forget to take breaks and give yourself some grace—working from home is a learning process, and it's okay to have off days. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you!","Working from home with family around is definitely challenging! Here are some strategies that can help boost your concentration:

First, try creating a dedicated workspace if possible - even if it's just a corner of a room. Put up a ""do not disturb"" sign when you're working and communicate with your husband about helping manage interruptions during your focus blocks.

The Pomodoro method is great, but 25 minutes might be too long with your current environment. Try starting with 15-minute focused sessions instead. As you build the habit, you can gradually increase the duration. The key is to make it achievable.

For the cat, consider having a designated cat bed or perch near your workspace. This can help satisfy their need for proximity while minimizing disruptions. Keep some treats handy to reward them for calm behavior.

Regarding food distractions, prep your snacks/drinks before starting work and keep them at your workspace. This eliminates the need to visit the kitchen during focus time.

You might also benefit from noise-canceling headphones and using white noise or instrumental music to block out household sounds. Some people find that having a ""work playlist"" helps signal to their brain that it's focus time.

Remember that building concentration takes practice. Start small, be consistent, and your ability to focus will improve over time. Each small win counts!","Working from home can be tough with all the distractions. One thing that might help is to create a dedicated workspace that's only for work - this can help you get into a ""work mode"" mindset and signal to your family that you're not available during certain hours. You could also try communicating your work schedule and boundaries with your husband and kid, so they know when you're focusing and can't be interrupted. As for the pomodoro method, you might consider extending your focus sessions to 45 or 60 minutes, with longer breaks in between - sometimes it takes a bit of time to get into a flow state, and the shorter sessions might not be giving you enough time to concentrate. Additionally, try to eliminate or silence as many distractions as possible during your work sessions - turn off notifications on your phone, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and consider using noise-cancelling headphones or playing calming music to help you stay focused.","Hey, working from home with all those distractions is definitely a challenge! The Pomodoro Technique is a good start, but maybe we can tweak it.

First, can you carve out a dedicated workspace, even if it's just a corner? Make it clear to your family that when you're in that space, you're ""at work"" and shouldn't be disturbed unless it's important. Visual cues like a closed door or even headphones can help.

Second, think about when you're *most* productive. Can you schedule your most focused work for those times, maybe when the kiddo is napping or your husband is handling things?

Third, for those 25-minute Pomodoro sessions, try to eliminate as many distractions as possible *before* you start. Put your phone on silent, have a snack and water ready, and let your family know you're unavailable. If you *do* get interrupted, gently redirect and immediately get back to your task. Don't let the interruption derail the whole session.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's not going to be perfect every time. Just keep practicing and adjusting your strategy until you find something that works for you. Good luck!

t3_v5paqq,[NEED ADVICE] I cannot stick to exercising because I end up prioritizing other things,"Hi! So I'm currently coursing my last year of med school and throughout my career I've tried to make exercising a habit, but sometimes I have to go to the hospital or I have long shifts of classes/practices and I end up really tired and end up losing my streak of workouts.

I actually enjoy exercising! Since the pandemic started I discovered I enjoy exercising at home, so that's not really the problem. 

The main problem is that sometimes I have so many things to do or I'm so tired that I justify the fact that I do not have the time or energy for exercising. It's frustrating because sometimes I've been working out for a whole month and then I have a week of exams and quizzes so I stop working out to study and then it's so hard for me to get back on track and it takes me from 2-3 weeks to start exercising again :( This has been going on for years and I have never really known what to do. 

Any advices would be really appreciated :-)",Do it first thing in the morning. It will give you energy for everything else.,First thing in the morning.,"Hey there! Balancing med school and exercise is definitely a challenge, but it's great that you enjoy working out. One approach you might find helpful is to integrate shorter, more flexible workouts into your routine. Even 10-15 minutes of exercise can be effective and easier to fit into a busy schedule. Consider scheduling these mini-sessions during breaks or right after a class to make them a regular part of your day. Also, try to view exercise as a way to recharge rather than another task on your to-do list. It might help to set a non-negotiable time for exercise, just like you would for a class or meeting. Lastly, remember that it's okay to have off weeks. The key is to get back into it without guilt. Consistency over perfection! Keep at it, and good luck with your studies!","First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Med school is incredibly demanding, and it's completely normal for exercise habits to get disrupted during intense periods.

Instead of aiming for perfect consistency, try shifting to a more flexible mindset. During regular weeks, stick to your usual workout routine. But during exam weeks or heavy hospital rotations, scale down rather than stopping completely. Even 5-10 minutes of basic exercises (quick stretching, bodyweight exercises, or a short walk) can maintain the habit without taking away from your studies.

The key is to have different ""modes"" of exercise:
Regular mode: Your normal home workouts
Busy mode: Ultra-short sessions (5-10 min)
Recovery mode: Light stretching or walking

This way, you're never fully ""breaking"" the streak - you're just adjusting the intensity based on your current demands. It's much easier to bounce back to regular workouts when you've kept even a minimal routine going.

Remember that some movement is always better than none. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. You've already shown you can maintain exercise for a month at a time - now it's just about building bridges across those busy periods rather than letting them become complete stops.","It sounds like you're facing a classic challenge of balancing multiple priorities, especially with the demanding schedule of med school. One strategy that might help is to start small and aim for consistency over perfection. Instead of trying to maintain a streak of daily workouts, could you commit to just 2-3 times a week, even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day? This way, you'll be more likely to stick to it even on busy weeks. Additionally, try to schedule your workouts at the same time every day or week, so it becomes a non-negotiable part of your routine, just like studying or hospital shifts. It might also be helpful to identify specific times when you tend to fall off track, like during exam weeks, and plan ahead for those periods by finding shorter, more manageable workout routines that can fit into your study schedule. Remember, it's not about being perfect, but about making progress and finding a balance that works for you in the long term.","Hey! Med school is brutal, so it's totally understandable that exercise routines get disrupted. Don't beat yourself up too much about it.

Instead of aiming for perfect consistency, maybe try focusing on *minimums*. Like, tell yourself ""I'll do *at least* 15 minutes of something, even if it's just stretching or a quick bodyweight circuit"" on those crazy days. It's way easier to convince yourself to do a little bit than a full-blown workout when you're exhausted. And often, once you get started, you'll feel good enough to do more!

Also, think about *when* you're most likely to succeed. Is there a small window in your day, even on busy days, where you could reliably squeeze something in? Maybe it's before your first class, or during a lunch break. Pre-planning that time and setting a reminder can help.

Finally, remember that consistency isn't about never missing a day, it's about getting back on track quickly when you do. So, instead of waiting 2-3 weeks to restart, aim for 2-3 *days*. The faster you bounce back, the less momentum you lose. Good luck, you got this!

How can I stay productive","Have you considered... Boredom?

I'm being 100% serious here.

The entire concept of having to be productive all day every day is incredibly unhealthy in the long term. Allow yourself to be bored, it is incredilby healthy to let your brain sit in boredom for a bit, just be sure to keep doing what you do in regards to work/workout/reading.

Maybe some kind of art, learning an instrument, learning a new skill like voice acting, etc.","I’m going into junior year, but my schools already out. And I need to gain muscle, since I’m way too skinny","Hey there! It sounds like you're looking to fill your day with more activities that keep you engaged and productive. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Explore New Hobbies**: Try picking up a new skill or hobby that interests you. It could be something like learning a musical instrument, cooking, or even a new language. There are tons of free resources online to get you started.

2. **Set Small Goals**: Break your day into chunks and set small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as organizing a part of your room, writing a journal entry, or even going for a walk. These small wins can add up and give you a sense of accomplishment.

3. **Active Rest**: If you’re worried about being inactive, consider incorporating more movement into your day. This doesn’t have to be intense exercise—simple things like stretching, yoga, or even a short walk can keep you active.

4. **Volunteer or Join Online Communities**: If you're looking to connect with others, consider volunteering or joining online communities related to your interests. It’s a great way to meet people and contribute to something meaningful.

Remember, it's okay to have downtime too. Balance is key, and finding what works for you might take some experimenting. Keep at it, and you'll find a routine that feels fulfilling!","Hey there! Being active doesn't mean you need to be exercising 24/7. Rest days are actually crucial for seeing results from working out - that's when your muscles repair and grow stronger. What matters more is staying consistent with your workouts and maintaining a generally active lifestyle.

Since you're looking to fill your day productively, try breaking up your reading sessions into smaller chunks instead of long stretches. Read for 30 minutes, then take a walk or do some stretching. This can help you stay engaged while keeping your body moving.

There are tons of free activities you can add to your routine: Going for walks or runs, doing bodyweight exercises at home, practicing yoga from YouTube videos, or even learning new skills online through free resources. You might also want to check out your local library - they often have free events and activities.

Consider volunteering in your community too. It's a great way to stay active, meet people, and do something meaningful with your time. Food banks, animal shelters, and community gardens are always looking for help.

The key is finding a sustainable balance between physical activity, mental engagement, and rest. Start small by adding one new activity to your routine and build from there. Remember, productivity isn't about being busy every minute - it's about making meaningful progress toward your goals.","It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck and unsure how to fill your time in a way that's engaging and productive. First, let's give you credit for already having a workout routine and reading habit - those are great foundations to build on. To stay active outside of your dedicated workout time, you might consider incorporating more movement into your daily routine, like taking a short walk after reading or doing a few jumping jacks during commercial breaks if you're watching TV. As for productivity, have you thought about exploring other hobbies or interests that don't require sitting down for long periods? Maybe try gardening, drawing, or even learning a new skill through online tutorials. These can help add some variety to your day and give you a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, you could look into volunteering or joining a local community group to meet new people and potentially make some friends. Remember, small steps can add up over time, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results from your workout routine. Focus on progress, not perfection, and try to find ways to make the rest of your day more engaging and active.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but also actively trying to improve, which is awesome! It's tough when you feel like you have a lot of empty time.

First, about the working out and inactivity: you're right, being sedentary the rest of the day can hinder progress. Think about incorporating more movement throughout your day. Even small things like walking during phone calls, doing some stretching every hour, or taking the stairs can make a difference. Look up ""NEAT"" (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) for ideas.

As for filling your day productively, since money is tight, focus on free or low-cost options. Libraries are goldmines! See if yours offers free classes or workshops (everything from computer skills to creative writing). You could also volunteer – it's a great way to meet people and gain experience. Think about what skills you'd *like* to have and see if there are online tutorials or free courses you can follow. Websites like Coursera and edX often have free audit options.

Reading is great, but if you hate sitting, try audiobooks while you're walking or doing chores. Maybe explore different genres or authors to reignite your interest.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of small, consistent steps. Pick one or two things from these suggestions and focus on incorporating them into your routine. It's better to do a little bit consistently than to try to overhaul everything at once and burn out. Good luck!

t3_13h0gds,Waking up earlier [Need Advice],"
Hi, I’m looking to be more consistent with the gym but going to the gym after work is a nightmare my energy levels are way to unpredictable. I want to be a 5 am gym girly but I’m not sure how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you 🌻","This kind of change generally requires two types of discipline. You'll need to consistently get up early, but you'll also need to consistently go to bed early.

Most adults need to consistently get 7 or more hours of sleep per night. It's not unusual for someone to need 8-9 hours of sleep to feel fully rested. If you start getting less sleep than usual because you're waking up at 5 am without going to bed earlier, it's very likely to cause problems. Feeling tired during the day is just one of them. Lack of sleep may impact your mood, decision-making skills, creativity, and other abilities.

It can also be difficult to sleep well if you make a big change to your sleep schedule all at once. You might be more successful if you shift your sleep schedule 15 minutes at a time over a period of days until you're waking up as early as you want.

It also helps to keep a consistent sleep schedule. It will probably be easier to wake up consistently at 5 am if you're on the same sleep schedule every day, instead of only waking up early on certain days. It's not a problem to stay up a bit late or sleep in every once in a while, but a consistent sleep schedule tends to be easier to maintain.",Thank you so much for sharing this advice with me 🌻. It helped me understand why when I tried last month to do this I became very irritated throughout the day and sluggish. I’ll try the 15 minute interval changes and set a bedtime that actually works,"Hey there! 🌟 Becoming a 5 am gym person is totally doable with a few adjustments. Start by gradually shifting your bedtime earlier, maybe by 15 minutes each night, so you can wake up feeling rested. Set a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, to help your body adjust. Prep your gym clothes and gear the night before to make mornings easier. Also, try to limit screen time before bed to improve sleep quality. It might take a bit of time, but stick with it, and soon those early mornings will feel like second nature. You've got this! 💪","Becoming an early morning gym-goer is totally doable with the right approach! The key is to make the transition gradually rather than forcing yourself into a 5am schedule right away. Start by moving your bedtime 15-30 minutes earlier each week, and do the same with your wake-up time. This gives your body clock time to adjust naturally.

Some practical tips that make early morning workouts easier: lay out your gym clothes the night before, prep your pre-workout snack/coffee, and keep your alarm across the room so you have to physically get up to turn it off. The first few minutes are always the hardest, but having everything ready to go removes decision fatigue when you're groggy.

The most important factor is actually your evening routine. You'll want to start winding down 1-2 hours before bed - dim the lights, avoid screens (or use blue light filters), and develop a consistent bedtime ritual. Your morning success is really set up the night before.

Give yourself at least 3-4 weeks to fully adapt to the new schedule. The first week especially might feel rough, but your body will adjust if you stay consistent. And remember - you don't have to jump straight to 5am. Starting with 6am or even 7am and gradually working earlier can make the transition much more sustainable.","Waking up at 5 am to hit the gym can be a game-changer, and it's great that you're looking to make a consistent change. To start, I'd recommend setting your goal incrementally - instead of trying to wake up at 5 am right away, try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night and waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each morning until you reach your desired wake-up time. This will help your body adjust to the new sleep schedule. Additionally, having a solid bedtime routine can signal to your brain that it's time to wind down, making it easier to wake up in the morning. You could try reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some light stretches before bed to get yourself ready for the next day. As for the gym, consider planning out your workouts the night before, laying out your clothes and packing your bag, so you can just grab and go in the morning. It might take some time for your body to adjust, but with a consistent routine and a bit of patience, you can become that 5 am gym girl 🌻💪","Hey! I totally get the struggle of wanting to become a morning gym person. It's a tough transition, but definitely doable.

First, don't try to jump straight to 5 am. Start by waking up just 15-30 minutes earlier than usual for a few days. Once that feels okay, bump it another 15-30 minutes. Slow and steady wins the race!

Prep as much as you can the night before. Lay out your gym clothes, pack your bag, and even decide what you're going to do at the gym. The less you have to think about in the morning, the easier it will be to get out the door.

Also, think about what motivates you. Maybe it's a specific workout playlist, a new workout outfit, or the feeling of accomplishment after a good session. Use that as fuel! And don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Just get back on track the next day. You got this! 🌻

If you dont instantly start abusing your dopamine with a phone/pc etc I guarantee you youll get bored enough to even kinda want to do school work. Maybe not the first day but as soon as the second day already you might be so bored that you’d rather do your school work than nothing,"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common struggle. One thing that might help is creating a clear boundary between your work and rest spaces. Try to reserve your bed strictly for sleeping. When you feel the urge to lie down, remind yourself that it's not an option until bedtime. You could also set up a more inviting workspace with good lighting and maybe some background music to keep you engaged. Another trick is to use a timer, like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and give you structured rest periods. Lastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for each study session to keep yourself motivated. Good luck!","This is a common habit loop that's tough to break, but totally fixable. The key is making your bed an exclusively sleep-only zone, not a place for work or scrolling. Your brain has learned to associate your bed with relaxation and distraction rather than rest.

Try setting up a dedicated workspace that's not in your bedroom if possible. If you have to work in your bedroom, face away from the bed and make it slightly less comfy during the day (remove extra pillows, don't make it look super inviting).

For the work itself, use the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. During breaks, stand up and move around instead of lying down. This helps maintain energy and creates a clear distinction between work and rest time.

When you feel that urge to ""rest,"" acknowledge it but redirect yourself. Instead of lying down, try a quick walk, some stretches, or even just standing up and getting water. The goal is to break the automatic bed = rest association.

Start small - maybe commit to staying at your desk for just one more Pomodoro session than usual. Build up gradually. The more you resist the bed during work hours, the easier it becomes to maintain proper work/rest boundaries.

Remember: your bed should be for sleeping at night, not for daytime productivity attempts. Keep that space sacred for its intended purpose and you'll likely see improvements in both your work output and sleep quality.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common habit loop - as soon as you get home, your brain associates it with relaxation and sleep. To break this cycle, try setting a clear boundary between work/study time and rest time. When you get home, commit to doing at least 90 minutes of focused school work at your desk before allowing yourself to take a break. Use a timer if needed to help you stay on track. During this time, eliminate any distractions like social media or phone notifications. Once you've completed your focused work session, you can then take a short break to relax and recharge - but try to do it in a different location, like a couch or outdoor area, to associate bed with sleep only. Additionally, make your bed a sleep-only zone by removing any screens or work materials from it, so your brain starts to see it as a place for rest, not leisure or productivity.","Hey, I totally get that feeling – the bed just *calls* to you sometimes! It sounds like your bed has become a trigger for relaxation (and procrastination) instead of just sleep. Here's a few things that might help:

First, try to create a clear separation between your workspace and your relaxation space. If possible, don't do *any* work in your bed. That means no laptop, no books, nothing. Your bed should be only for sleep and maybe reading for pleasure.

Second, when you get home, immediately change your clothes. Don't stay in comfy clothes that make you want to relax. Changing into something that signals ""work time"" can help shift your mindset.

Third, break your work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of aiming for hours of work, try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break *away* from your bed. Get up, stretch, grab a drink, then get back to it. This can make the task seem less daunting and prevent that ""I need a rest"" feeling from hitting so hard.

Finally, be honest with yourself about the ""work while laying down"" thing. It's clearly not working for you. Acknowledge that, and actively resist the urge. When that thought pops up, immediately get up and go back to your desk. It's about retraining your brain. Good luck, you got this!

t3_qy8khj,[Need Advice] I need help as I am in my late 20s and feel that my best years are already over.,"I (26, M) used to run half marathons during my college days but four years since graduation, I am an obese, lazy being. Over the years, I have tried to get back into running numerous times, but I feel that my body had peaked a long time ago and my physique is on a constant decline. I still want to lose weight and get fit, if necessary by other means, but I do not have the energy to carry out extensive internet researches for plans, apps and guides. I also struggle with maintaining a healthy diet as I tend to overeat and sleep, everytime I am going through an anxiety attack or depressed.

What do I do to help myself?","This reminds me a lot of myself from a few years ago. 

You shouldn't take this as medical advice, but for me it helped to seek help from a psychiatrist who then diagnosed me as suffering from depression and anxiety, and prescribed anti-depressants (a low dosage of citalopram balanced me out after a few weeks).

Anti-depressants were a temporary measure, though, and caused me to gain even more weight (I went from 100 kg to 117kg), so I had to start exercising. Over the last year I lost that extra weight and built up muscle due to regular exercise. I go for a 1h swim six times a week nowadays, but at the start I was barely managing 20 minutes and swimming less then 0,5 km. I swim 2,7km in 1 hour now. 
I'm also off anti-depressants now and I am in the best shape of my life (though I'm not done yet). 

My advice? Start exercising now. Do whatever you can, and do as little or as much as you can.

Don't feel like running? Walk.

Can't walk much? Then walk for 5 minutes.

Do crunches or push-ups at home. Can't do more than one? Then just do the one.

Whatever you do and no matter how little you do, just do it, and do it everyday. This alone will make you feel better.

Don't push yourself too hard, though. You will fail if you try to run marathons now. 
Aim to run marathons in a couple of years. 
Be patient with yourself. 
Be kind to yourself.

And if you can, seek professional help. Find a therapist. Practice mindfulness. And keep up hope.

You are in your late 20s. I am nearly 40 and I truly feel like my best years have just begun. 

You have all the time to achieve whatever you set your mind to. Just as long as you don't give up and are patient with yourself. 

There is no easy way. But there is a way, and it's yours. So go. 

Good luck and godspeed. I don't know you, but I believe in you and I'll be rooting for you.",Thank you so much for taking the time out to write an exhaustive message. I'll surely try to structure my thought process to align with my physical output in a better way.,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It’s never too late to get back on track, and your past experience with running shows you have the potential to be active and fit again. Here’s a simple plan to get started:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of jumping back into half marathons, try short, manageable runs or even brisk walks. The key is consistency, not intensity. Aim for 10-15 minutes a day and gradually increase as you feel more comfortable.

2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals. For example, aim to run a certain number of days a week or gradually increase your distance. Celebrate these small victories to keep motivated.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. You don’t need to overhaul your diet overnight. Start by incorporating more whole foods and reducing processed snacks. Keeping a food journal might help you identify patterns and triggers for overeating.

4. **Address Anxiety and Depression**: It’s important to tackle these head-on. Consider speaking with a professional who can provide strategies to manage these feelings. Exercise can also be a great way to boost your mood and reduce anxiety.

5. **Accountability**: Find a friend or join a community (online or offline) that shares similar goals. Having someone to check in with can make a big difference in staying disciplined.

Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You’ve got this!","Hey there - first off, your best years are definitely not behind you at 26. Many people don't even start getting seriously fit until their 30s or 40s. Your previous running experience is actually an advantage - your body remembers, and you can build back up.

Start small. Really small. Instead of jumping straight back into running, begin with 10-15 minute walks. Once that becomes routine, gradually increase the duration and add light jogging intervals. The key is consistency over intensity right now.

For the diet and anxiety connection - this is super common. Rather than trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small change. Maybe swap one snack for something healthier, or try eating more slowly at one meal per day. Small wins build momentum.

You don't need extensive research or complex plans. The basics work: move more, eat less processed food, get decent sleep. There's a great app called ""Couch to 5K"" that can help ease you back into running gradually, if you want to return to that.

Remember that fitness isn't linear. Everyone has setbacks. What matters is getting back up and trying again, even if it's just for 5 minutes today. You've done impressive things before, and you absolutely can do them again - just focus on one small step at a time.

Want to start today? Go for a 10 minute walk. That's it. Tomorrow, do it again. Build from there. You've got this.","It's great that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to make a change. First, let's ditch the idea that your best years are behind you - 26 is still incredibly young, and many people achieve their fitness goals in their 30s, 40s, and beyond. As for getting started, instead of overwhelming yourself with research, try setting small, achievable goals for now. For example, start by taking short walks each day or doing a few push-ups/squats in the morning. This will help build momentum and confidence. 

For diet, consider consulting a nutritionist or a doctor who can provide personalized advice, especially since you're dealing with anxiety and depression. They can help you develop a plan that suits your needs and lifestyle. Additionally, look into simple, sustainable changes like meal prepping, keeping a food diary, or using an app like MyFitnessPal to track your eating habits. 

Remember, it's not about finding the perfect plan or app, but about making progress and being consistent. You might also want to explore other forms of exercise that don't involve running, like swimming, cycling, or yoga, which can be lower-impact and easier on your joints. Lastly, don't underestimate the power of small wins - celebrate each tiny victory, and use that motivation to keep moving forward. You got this, and it's never too late to start anew.","Hey man, I get it. It's easy to feel like you've lost momentum, but 26 is definitely not ""over the hill""! You've got a solid foundation from your running days, so you're not starting from scratch.

Instead of trying to jump back into half-marathon shape immediately, which can be super discouraging, try micro-goals. Seriously, think *tiny*. Like, ""walk for 10 minutes three times this week."" That's it. No pressure to run, just get moving. Once you've nailed that, bump it up a little. The key is consistency, not intensity, at this stage.

For the diet side, instead of a complete overhaul, focus on one small change. Maybe it's swapping sugary drinks for water, or adding a serving of vegetables to one meal a day. Small wins build momentum and make bigger changes feel less daunting.

Regarding the anxiety/depression and overeating, that's a tough cycle. Instead of immediately reaching for food, try to identify what triggers those feelings. Then, have a go-to alternative ready. Could be a quick walk, listening to music, or even just deep breathing exercises. It won't magically fix everything, but it can help break the immediate connection between feeling bad and overeating.

Forget the extensive research for now. Keep it simple, keep it small, and focus on building sustainable habits. You've got this!

t3_12k7iil,[Need Advice]I cant even get myself to work 3 hours a day consistently.,"Hello, I started since Monday a goal to work at least 3 hours a day of pure work. The first two days I did will and actually worked for 4 hours. But by Wednesday i couldn’t even get myself to work more than an hour. I spent so much energy forcing myself to work that day and I couldn’t do it. Almost like I was constipated mentally.

Should I lower down the work hours (even tho 3 is so small). And try to gradually increase the minimum time working? Or is it because I just don’t care enough about this business I’m working on. I’m amazed how people can work 6 hours a day of pure focused work. Sometimes I think there’s something wrong with me.

When it comes to gym, eating healthy I can see those benefits immediately right after and feel good. But with work I feel like shit after and I don’t really care about making bank. I do feel good sometimes but for the most part its a chore that makes me dislike life more.

Thank you!","Look up Atomic Habits. The real goal right now is to just convince yourself to show up to your work setting and not worry about how long. Maybe a few times a day to return. Maybe you get some in, maybe not. But good chance while you're at it without the pressure you will.

Next make it fun, find something to reward yourself ONLY when you do some work. That's it. The only time. Associate it with doing the Thing (work) and you'll enjoy work a bit more knowing what you get out of the deal","Start so small that you laugh at it, do it for a week, increase by 10min, do it for a week, rinse & repeat until you’re at your goal of 3h. It’ll take longer but it’ll be a habit.

You can also look up the pomodoro technique, think of ways to make it fun (reward yourself etc but not every time), have a deal made with someone that you pay them £xx.xx or donate to something you dislike if you miss 2 days in a row or 2 days from the same week. We can work a lot better with a drive to do it (the fun part) and a drive to not miss it (the punishment of losing money/whatever you decide).

Try to make sure you enjoy the work you’re doing too if you’re lucky enough to be in that situation, definitely helps a whole lot!

EDIT: Forgot to mention finding out ‘Why’ you’re doing this work, what drives you? Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you’re having a bad day and ask yourself “what the f am I doing this?” Your brain replies with the answer and continue.","Hey there! It sounds like you're really trying to find a balance that works for you, and that's a great start. First off, don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to have fluctuations in motivation and energy. If 3 hours feels overwhelming right now, it's totally okay to scale back a bit. Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. 

Also, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one. It might also help to set specific goals for each session, so you have a clear purpose and can see progress over time.

Since you mentioned that you don't feel the same immediate benefits from work as you do from the gym or eating healthy, try to find ways to make your work more rewarding. Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.

Lastly, it's worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn't, it might be why you're struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You've got this!","Starting with 3 hours and dropping to 1 isn't unusual at all - this happens to most people when building new work habits. The mental resistance you're experiencing is totally normal, especially since you mentioned not feeling particularly passionate about the business side of things.

Here's what I'd suggest: Start with just 25 minutes of focused work (one Pomodoro), followed by a 5-minute break. Do this twice a day at first. It's ridiculously easy, but that's the point - you want to build consistency before duration. Once this becomes effortless (probably after a week or two), add another session. Keep building gradually.

The gym analogy you made is really interesting - you're motivated there because you get immediate positive feedback. We can use this! Try breaking your work into smaller chunks where you can feel that same sense of completion. Set tiny goals that you can ""check off"" every 25 minutes, giving yourself that same hit of accomplishment you get from the gym.

Also, consider examining what type of work actually energizes you versus drains you. If the business itself feels like a constant drain, it might be worth exploring what aspects of work do give you that ""feel good"" sensation, even if it's just small parts of your current projects.

Remember, those people working focused for 6 hours didn't start there - they built up to it. There's nothing wrong with you; you're just at the beginning of building this particular muscle. Start small, be consistent, and gradually level up.","It sounds like you're struggling to find motivation and consistency with your work schedule, and that's totally normal. One approach you might consider is indeed starting smaller and gradually increasing your daily work time. Instead of aiming for 3 hours right off the bat, try committing to a manageable 30 minutes or 1 hour of focused work each day, and then gradually add more time as you build the habit. This can help make the task less daunting and allow you to develop a sense of momentum.

It's also worth exploring why you feel so differently about work compared to other activities like going to the gym or eating healthy. You mention that with those activities, you can see the benefits immediately and feel good afterwards. With work, it might be helpful to try to identify some more immediate rewards or benefits, even if they're not directly related to making money. For example, do you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing a task? Do you enjoy the process of learning new skills or solving problems?

As for whether you care enough about your business, that's a tough question to answer, but it might be worth reflecting on what specifically is driving your lack of motivation. Is it the type of work itself, or is it something else entirely? Are there ways you could make your work more engaging or meaningful to you? Remember that it's okay if your motivations and interests evolve over time, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you.","Hey, it's totally normal to struggle with consistency, especially when you're first starting out. Don't beat yourself up about it!

It sounds like you're experiencing burnout, which is common when you push too hard too fast. Lowering your work hours and gradually increasing them is a solid strategy. Think of it like building a muscle – you wouldn't start with the heaviest weight. Maybe start with 1-2 hours and add 15 minutes each day or every few days.

Also, the fact that you enjoy the gym and healthy eating more suggests you value the immediate feedback. Work often lacks that instant gratification. Try breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable tasks with clear, achievable goals. Completing those smaller tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum.

Finally, it's worth exploring *why* you're working on this business. If you don't care about the outcome, it's going to be a constant uphill battle. Can you connect your work to something you *do* care about, even if it's indirectly? Or maybe this business isn't the right fit, and that's okay too. Good luck!

t3_rnpw4g,[Need Advice] How do I overcome complacency?,"Complacency for me is staying at the same area I am at, no matter if I am already good at this area. I want to grow in life, but in more areas than not, I feel like I am complacent and also procrastinate on achieving my goals and dreams. 

For this discussion, I would like some advice on how to overcome complacency and apathy in life, how do I make sure I am continually growing, and how do I continually get out of my comfort zone?","I agree with you. One of the reasons I have for getting out of my comfort zone is to not waste my life being mediocre and to really have a positive impact on the world. A lot of people have a midlife crisis because they are being complacent. I have other reasons too, but this is one of them.","Why do you want to keep growing and get out of your comfort zone? This might seem like a strange question to ask, but different people will want this for different reasons. If you really want this then it can be extremely helpful to know why, exactly, you want it.","Hey there! It sounds like you're ready to shake things up and push past that comfort zone. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Clear, Specific Goals**: Instead of vague goals like ""I want to grow,"" try setting specific, measurable goals. For example, ""I want to learn a new skill, like coding, and complete an online course in three months."" This gives you a clear target to aim for.

2. **Break It Down**: Big goals can be overwhelming, so break them into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.

3. **Create a Routine**: Discipline often comes from routine. Set aside specific times each day or week dedicated to working on your goals. Consistency is key.

4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community with similar interests. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and accountable.

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. What's working? What's not? Be open to adjusting your approach if needed.

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Don't wait until you've achieved the big goal to celebrate. Acknowledge and reward yourself for the small victories along the way.

Remember, growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, so embrace the discomfort as a sign that you're moving in the right direction. Good luck!","Overcoming complacency starts with recognizing that growth requires deliberate discomfort - you're already ahead by acknowledging this. The key is creating systems that push you forward rather than relying on motivation alone.

Start by setting specific, measurable goals in different areas of your life. Instead of vague aims like ""get better at programming,"" try ""complete one new coding project each month"" or ""learn three new programming concepts weekly."" This makes progress trackable and gives you clear targets to work toward.

A practical approach is to schedule regular ""growth reviews"" - maybe every Sunday evening. During these sessions, evaluate what you accomplished that week, where you stayed in your comfort zone, and plan one specific way to challenge yourself in the coming week. This builds accountability and keeps growth at the forefront of your mind.

To consistently push boundaries, try the ""plus one"" method: whatever you're currently doing, add one small challenge. If you read one book monthly, aim for two. If you exercise twice weekly, add a third session. These incremental steps make getting out of your comfort zone more manageable while maintaining steady progress.

Remember that growth isn't always about doing more - sometimes it's about doing different things or approaching familiar tasks in new ways. Mix up your routines, take on projects that scare you a little, and connect with people who inspire you to level up.

The antidote to procrastination is making the first step ridiculously small. Want to write a book? Start with one paragraph daily. Want to learn a language? Begin with five minutes of practice. These tiny commitments often naturally expand once you're in motion.

Your awareness of complacency is the first step to defeating it. Now it's about creating consistent action through systems and gradual challenges rather than waiting for motivation to strike.","Overcoming complacency is a great goal to have, and it's awesome that you're recognizing the need for growth in multiple areas of your life. One strategy that might help is to set specific, challenging goals for yourself in different areas, like learning a new skill or taking on a new hobby. Break down these larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to help build momentum and make progress feel more tangible. It's also important to create an environment that encourages growth, whether that means surrounding yourself with people who inspire you, reading books or articles that challenge your perspectives, or seeking out new experiences that push you out of your comfort zone. 

Another approach is to schedule regular ""check-ins"" with yourself, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly, to reflect on your progress and identify areas where you might be getting too comfortable. Ask yourself questions like ""What have I learned recently?"", ""What challenges am I avoiding?"", and ""What small step can I take today to move closer to my goals?"" By regularly assessing your progress and making intentional decisions about how you want to grow, you can start to build a sense of discipline and momentum that helps you overcome complacency. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you find it tough to get out of your comfort zone at first - it's a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Celebrate your small wins, and use those as motivation to keep pushing forward. What do you think is the first area you'd like to tackle, and what's one small step you could take this week to start making progress?","Hey, I get that feeling of being stuck in a rut. It's tough when you know you want more but can't seem to break free. Here's a few things that have helped me:

First, try breaking down those big ""goals and dreams"" into super small, manageable steps. Like, ridiculously small. If you want to learn a language, don't aim for fluency right away. Aim for learning 5 new words a day. The key is to make it so easy you almost can't say no. Those small wins build momentum and make the bigger picture less daunting.

Second, actively seek out discomfort. Complacency thrives in comfort zones. Try something new every week, even if it's just a different route to work, a new genre of music, or striking up a conversation with a stranger. The more you expose yourself to the unfamiliar, the less scary it becomes.

Third, find an accountability buddy. Tell someone your goals and ask them to check in on your progress. Knowing someone else is watching can be a powerful motivator.

Finally, remember that growth isn't always linear. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're not making progress. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13dj7s8,[Need Advice] Trouble waking up in the morning,"Hello! im a 26y old male, and sometimes i have trouble waking up in the morning, and am late to work because of it. They things ive tried/am doing are:

1. No pc/tv 2 hours before going to sleep
2. Always go to sleep and wake up at the same time (i wake up at 6am and go to sleep at 11pm)
3. I exercise regularly (5-6 times a week, mostly running)
4. I dont drink coffee after lunch, so i drink about 0.5l before 14pm
5. I prepare everything i need in the morning before going to sleep (meaning, I plan and prepare what im going to eat, prepare coffee, prepare clothing im going to wear and basically everything i need)
6. I read before sleeping (I read allot)
7. 15mins before falling asleep, I visualize my morning routine in my head a few times
8. I have an alarm on my phone and an alarm clock, which i both hide across my room

So far, statistically, i wake up as planned (so at exactly 6am) about 70% of the time. Also, today i tried the Alarmy app, (its an alarm app for waking up, when you wake up you have to solve a puzzle or some math problems before you can turn the alarm off) and it worked very well. 

Now im asking for ideas on how to get that 70% success rate of waking up on time to a 100% success rate. Any answers, suggestions and ideas are welcome!","I have an alarm that lights up gently around 30 mins before wake time, and I put a pint glass of water next to my bed at night and try to have a big drink on waking. It’s hard to stay in bed when you’re desperate for the bathroom.","You may just need more sleep. 

How long do you sleep on the weekend in total?

How's your diet?

Also we are not robots. You say you wake up at 6 am 70% of the time. Why not 100% of the time when you lose an alarm? What happens on those 30% ofdays?","Hey there! It sounds like you're already doing a lot of great things to improve your morning routine. Here are a few more ideas that might help you get closer to that 100% success rate:

1. **Sleep Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is optimized for sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, blackout curtains, and a cool room temperature. Sometimes small tweaks can make a big difference.

2. **Consistent Wind-Down Routine**: You mentioned reading before bed, which is great. Try to keep your wind-down routine consistent every night to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.

3. **Light Exposure**: In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. This can help reset your internal clock and make waking up easier. If natural light isn't an option, consider a light therapy lamp.

4. **Alarm Variety**: Since Alarmy worked well for you, maybe try varying the types of puzzles or challenges it offers. This can keep your brain engaged and prevent you from getting too used to the same routine.

5. **Mindfulness or Meditation**: Incorporating a short mindfulness or meditation practice before bed can help improve sleep quality, making it easier to wake up.

Remember, perfection isn't always necessary, and even a 70% success rate is a solid foundation. Keep experimenting with small changes, and you'll likely find what works best for you. Good luck!","You're already doing a lot of great things with your evening routine! Getting to 70% consistency is actually impressive. For that final 30%, here are some additional strategies that could help:

First, track the mornings when you don't wake up successfully. Look for patterns - is it happening more on certain days of the week? After particular activities the day before? This data can help you identify and address specific triggers.

Since Alarmy worked well for you, consider combining it with a smart bulb or sunrise alarm clock. These gradually brighten your room before your alarm time, helping your body wake up more naturally. The light + puzzle combination can be really effective.

Also, while your sleep schedule is good, you might experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier. Sometimes we need a bit more sleep than we think, and that extra buffer can make morning wake-ups easier.

One last suggestion: create a small reward system for your first few minutes awake. Maybe it's a favorite podcast you only listen to during your morning routine, or a breakfast you really look forward to. Having something enjoyable right after waking can help train your brain to get up more willingly.

Keep building on what's working - you're definitely on the right track with your current habits. Small tweaks to an already solid foundation can make a big difference.","It sounds like you've already established a solid morning routine and have tried several strategies to improve your wake-up consistency. To help boost that 70% success rate to 100%, I'd suggest exploring a few additional tactics. Have you considered exposing yourself to natural light as soon as your alarm goes off? This can help regulate your circadian rhythms and make it easier to wake up. You could also try making your morning routine more enjoyable, such as listening to music or doing some light stretching - this might give you something to look forward to and make it easier to get out of bed. Additionally, you might want to experiment with a ""stop doing"" list, where you identify any habits or activities that might be sabotaging your sleep or making it harder to wake up, such as scrolling through your phone before bed or consuming heavy meals too close to bedtime. It's also worth considering whether there are any underlying issues, such as sleep quality or stress, that might be affecting your ability to wake up consistently. The Alarmy app seems like a great tool, so you might want to keep using that and see if you can combine it with some of these other strategies to get to 100%.","Hey, that's a really solid routine you've already built! Getting to 70% is a great accomplishment. Here are a few ideas to nudge you closer to 100%:

First, since you're already using Alarmy and it worked well, maybe experiment with different puzzle types or difficulty levels within the app. Keep it challenging enough that you're actually awake when you solve it.

Second, consider *why* you're failing the other 30% of the time. Are you hitting snooze without realizing it? Are you genuinely still exhausted? If it's exhaustion, maybe slightly adjust your bedtime earlier, even by just 15 minutes. If it's the snooze button, try putting your phone and alarm clock even FURTHER away, like in a different room entirely. Make it a real chore to turn them off.

Third, think about adding a reward system. If you wake up on time for a full week, treat yourself to something you enjoy (a special breakfast, a new book, etc.). Positive reinforcement can be surprisingly effective.

Finally, and this might sound counterintuitive, but don't beat yourself up too much about the occasional slip-up. It happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Consistency is key, but perfection is the enemy of good. Good luck!

t3_12qwplm,"[Need advice] M32, alcoholic trying desperately to stop","I'm currently suffering from perhaps the worst hangover of my life. I've been an alcoholic for just over five years, due to a combination of reasons. Apart from being woefully overworked, nothing in my life is really that bad right now- last month, I even reconnected with a woman I went to college with... 13 years later! And we're supposed to have dinner some time this week! 

So, my question is: recovering alcoholics, what advice do you have? I'm an atheist and tried the whole AA thing. My parents are worried about me, my employer is worried about me- I'm so, so ready to be done with alcohol. But it calls.... for those not in the know, it calls to you. It's like a siren's song. People say it's a disease, but it's more like a parasite, because it doesn't care what you think/feel/do. I literally just discovered this sub minutes ago by accident, and I hope I'm not crossing any lines/rules... I'm just so desperate for the answer that will work for me. 

Peace ✌️ and thank you in advance.","OK, I'm going to say something no one will like, please consider this other person and be upfront because ain't no one looking to fall unsuspecting into a relationship with an addict. They are living their own life for the last 13 years so really man, honesty is the best policy. Personally, I'd talk it over before exchanging any bodily fluids.

When people have sex, it creates bonding, like literally just the hormones flood and bonding occurs. It's why the decent thing to do is really be upfront prior to sex and anything intimate and not a moment before copulation but like in a casual setting explain your situation honestly. It's terrifying but the right thing to do.","Have a look at r/stopdrinking 
Hope you get through it mate 👍🏼","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking for advice—acknowledging the problem is a huge step. Since AA didn't resonate with you, maybe try exploring other support groups or resources that don't have a religious component, like SMART Recovery. They focus on self-empowerment and use a science-based approach, which might align better with your beliefs.

Building discipline is key, and it starts with small, manageable steps. Consider setting a daily goal, like reducing your alcohol intake gradually or replacing drinking with a healthier habit. Exercise can be a great outlet; it helps with stress and can improve your mood. Also, keep yourself busy with activities that you enjoy or that challenge you in a positive way.

Since you mentioned being overworked, it might help to evaluate your work-life balance. Sometimes stress can be a trigger, so finding ways to manage it, like through meditation or hobbies, can be beneficial.

Lastly, don't hesitate to lean on your support system. Your parents and employer are worried because they care, and having someone to talk to can make a big difference. And congrats on reconnecting with your college friend—having positive relationships can be a great motivator.

Stay strong, and remember, it's a journey. You've got this!","Hey there - first off, major props for reaching out and being ready to make this change. That takes real courage.

Since AA wasn't a fit for you, I'd strongly recommend checking out SMART Recovery. It's science-based, secular, and focuses on building practical skills to overcome addiction. They have both in-person and online meetings.

For the immediate term, you'll want to create physical distance between yourself and alcohol. Clear out your living space completely. No ""just in case"" bottles. Let trusted friends/family know you're quitting and ask them to help by not drinking around you for now.

The ""siren call"" you described is very real. Two things that can help combat this: First, play the tape forward - when you feel the urge, mentally walk through exactly how drinking will play out, including the inevitable hangover and regret. Second, have a concrete plan for what you'll do instead when cravings hit. Exercise, calling a friend, meditation - whatever healthy activity works for you.

Given your upcoming date, you might want to suggest meeting for coffee or another non-alcohol activity. Being upfront about making positive changes in your life can actually be attractive, and it removes the pressure of navigating drinking situations early in recovery.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about consistently making choices aligned with your goals, even after setbacks. You've got this, and there are lots of resources and people ready to support you on this journey.","Hey there, congratulations on taking the first step by acknowledging your struggle and seeking help. It's great that you've found this community, and I'm glad you're open to advice. Given your experience with AA didn't quite work out, let's focus on other strategies. Have you considered seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction? They can help you identify underlying issues contributing to your alcohol use and develop a personalized plan to overcome them. Additionally, you might find it helpful to keep yourself occupied with new hobbies or activities that bring you joy, making it easier to resist the temptation of alcohol. Since you mentioned being overworked, exploring ways to manage your workload or finding healthier coping mechanisms for stress could also be beneficial. It's also wonderful that you've reconnected with someone from your past - having a supportive social network can make a big difference in your journey. Remember, recovery is a process, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, but being willing to try different approaches and seek support is a huge step forward. Keep moving forward, and don't hesitate to reach out when you need guidance or just someone to talk to. ✌️","Hey, congrats on taking the first step and reaching out. It takes guts to admit you're ready for a change. Since AA wasn't your thing, let's think about some other strategies.

First, that siren's call is powerful, so you need to build up your defenses. Think about what triggers your cravings. Is it stress from work? Boredom? Loneliness? Once you know your triggers, you can develop specific coping mechanisms. For example, if it's work stress, maybe try a quick meditation app or a short walk during your break. If it's boredom, find a new hobby or project to dive into.

Second, since you're reconnecting with someone, lean into that! Having a positive social connection can be a huge motivator. Maybe suggest a non-alcohol-related activity for your dinner date.

Third, consider talking to a doctor about medical options. There are medications that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It's not a sign of weakness to need medical help; it's just smart.

Finally, track your progress. Use a journal or an app to note your cravings, triggers, and how you coped. Seeing your progress, even small steps, can be really encouraging.

It's a tough road, but you've got this. One day at a time.

t3_w7dira,[need advice] I dont know how to discipline myself. i have adhd and autism…,"I've been trying to discipline my self for years now but I just can't seem to do it. I'm always to lazy and/or fall off after 3/4 days of getting psyched to get myself to do things properly. My room is a mess, I can't seem to do my jobs right (payed, work etc) and I just don't know how to do it. I've been going threw a rough few months. My grand, father died, his wife who was like a second mom to me left us and my girlfriend left me. All in the span of 1 month (its been about 5 months since all of that happened) and it really doesn't help. I want to get on my feet but I don't know how. I smoke and drink and even if its not an issue as of the moment I am affraid it will... I dream of being a better me. I want to work out and get in shape, eat healthier and make the best of myself. But as of now, I have a hard time to even bath myself daylie. I know that consulting help doesn't really work for me. Not in a way that I am closed to it but in a way that I feel like I want to do it myself by discipline. I need helo to get back on my feet but it feels like my mind won't budge and its making me pissed. Please help me any kind of help and tips is welcomed :)","You’re not lazy. You’re neurodivergent. You’re probably bored and struggling to find meaning in tasks. *you are not lazy.* 

There is no correct way to compete a task. There is s way they will work for you and your brain. 

You don’t need to clean your room, you need to get it cleaner than it was five minutes ago. 

Do you like to sort things? Gréât. Get lots of storage tubs and work on just keeping clothes sorted. Don’t worry about folding or hanging clothes- just keep them off the floor and in some kind of container. Do you have trash everywhere? Get a kitchen trash can so you can throw paper and trash away immediately. 

Set a recurring alarm on your phone so you remember to wash your clothes and sheets once a week if you need to. 

Don’t vacuum. Get a dust buster and spot clean in the middle of the night. Keep paper towels and windex on your bookshelf or in your closet so you can clean off surfaces when you catch a glimpse of the bottle. 

Are you procrastinating your boring  ass work? Tidy up your room instead (I’m biased in saying this. I don’t like cleaning but I love organizing things and lining all my things up so when I get fidgety, I’ll organize.)

Don’t take a shower. Take a sponge bath (washcloth and soap on your pits and crotch, maybe wash your hair) in the sink and change your underwear. There. You’re cleaner than you were 5 minutes ago. Brush your teeth while you’re at it. Might as well. 
Go to therapy for grief. 

Self medicating isn’t great; but brains and neurodivergent brains crave stimuli so I get it. Chemical dependencies aren’t great though, and tou don’t want to accidentally start going to drugs and alcohol every time you feel a bad emotion. I would suggest that at the very least, you journal your feelings and work on being self aware of your triggers and the feelings that make you want to comfort yourself with drinking and weed. 

You *can* discipline yourself but I will tell you, it’s very very very hard to discipline yourself while also experiencing pain and grief and trauma. You need a break. You need time to stop carrying so much. You cannot expect to get better while beating yourself up and shaming yourself for not being perfect.","Thats the hardest part, I blame myself for everything, but your advice means alot and I will definitely put it in my head.","I'm really sorry to hear about everything you've been going through. It sounds like a lot to handle, and it's understandable that you're struggling with discipline right now. Here are a few ideas that might help you get started on building some habits:

1. Start small. Pick one tiny habit to focus on, like making your bed every morning or spending 5 minutes tidying up your room. Once that becomes a routine, you can gradually add more.

2. Use timers. Set a timer for 10-15 minutes to work on a task. Knowing there's a set end time can make it easier to start, and you might find you want to keep going once you get into it.

3. Create a simple daily routine. Having a basic structure can help you feel more in control. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something to guide your day.

4. Celebrate small wins. Every little step forward is progress. Acknowledge and reward yourself for sticking to your habits, even if it's just a mental pat on the back.

5. Consider accountability. Sometimes sharing your goals with a friend or online community can help keep you motivated.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be kind to yourself and recognize that building discipline is a process. You've got this!","First off, you've been through a lot in a short time. It's completely understandable that you're struggling right now, but it's great that you're looking to make positive changes.

Since you mentioned ADHD and autism, let's start really small. Forget about all the big goals for now - working out, eating perfectly, etc. Instead, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Something ridiculously easy that takes less than 2 minutes. Maybe it's just putting one piece of trash in the bin each morning, or washing your face.

The key is to make it so simple you can't fail. Don't try to clean your whole room - just commit to picking up one thing daily. Don't worry about working out - just do one pushup or stretch for 30 seconds. The goal isn't the action itself, it's building the habit of showing up every day.

Once that tiny habit feels automatic (might take 2-3 weeks), add one more small thing. Maybe that's when you tackle the daily bathing. Break it down into steps if needed - just getting into the bathroom counts as a win at first.

For the ADHD specifically, external reminders are crucial. Put sticky notes where you'll see them, set phone alarms, or use habit tracking apps. Make it impossible to forget.

Remember that discipline isn't about motivation or willpower. It's about creating systems that work for your brain. Start incredibly small, be consistent, and gradually build up. You've got this - one tiny step at a time.","It's amazing that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to make a change, especially after going through such a tough time with all the losses you've experienced. Given your ADHD and autism, it might be helpful to focus on creating systems and routines that work for you, rather than trying to rely solely on willpower or motivation. 

One strategy could be to start incredibly small - like, tiny habits small. For example, instead of trying to clean your entire room, begin with making your bed every morning or putting away one item after use. This can help build momentum and a sense of accomplishment. It's also important to understand that it's okay to not be perfect and that discipline is not about being perfect, but about being consistent.

Given your concerns about smoking and drinking, you might consider setting specific, achievable goals related to these habits, like reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke per day or designating certain days as alcohol-free. 

Exercise and healthier eating are great goals, but again, starting small is key. Maybe begin with short walks or a few push-ups each day, and try to replace one unhealthy meal with a healthier option. It's about progress, not perfection.

Lastly, while you mentioned that consulting help doesn't work for you in terms of discipline, it might still be beneficial to have someone to talk to about your feelings and struggles. Sometimes, just having someone who understands can make a big difference. Remember, building discipline is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and there are many resources available online, from habit-tracking apps to forums like this one, where people share their experiences and tips. Keep in mind that celebrating small victories along the way can be a powerful motivator.","Hey, that sounds like a really tough time, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling. Losing your grandfather, his wife, and your girlfriend in such a short period is a lot to process. It's great that you recognize the need for change and want to build better habits.

Given the ADHD and autism, and the recent losses, maybe trying to overhaul everything at once isn't the best approach. Start *incredibly* small. Like, ridiculously small. Instead of ""work out,"" aim for ""do 5 push-ups"" or ""walk around the block."" Instead of ""eat healthier,"" try ""eat one piece of fruit today."" The goal is to build momentum and a sense of accomplishment, not to overwhelm yourself.

For the room, try the 5-minute rule. Set a timer for 5 minutes and just tidy up one small area. You might be surprised how much you can get done in that short time, and it's way less daunting than tackling the whole room at once.

Regarding the smoking and drinking, maybe focus on reducing rather than quitting cold turkey. Try setting a limit for yourself each day and sticking to it.

Also, be kind to yourself. You've been through a lot. Celebrate the small wins, and don't beat yourself up for the setbacks. It's a process, not a race. Maybe look into ADHD-specific strategies for habit building, as they often involve visual cues, reminders, and breaking tasks down into even smaller steps. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13gzhhe,[Need Advice] How can I reduce eating junk foods?,eating junk food is making me bad about myself. I promise myself that I will never have junk foods but always ends up having it. One of the habits I really want to change in myself for a longer period of time.,"Moderation.  Make the goal easier.  Youre dissapointing yourself too much by going ill never have any ever. 

You start by making more specific goals like: im only allowed junk/snacks x amount of times per week","I am a big emotional eater and junk food is my weakness. A couple things have helped me tone it down. 

Find less junky food you can eat instead. For example, I have apple chips that I’ve gotten into as a potato chip replacement. They’re sugary, sure, but better than the potato chips I used to mindlessly eat instead. Once you find a good healthier snack alternative, work your way up to healthier snacks or lower frequency of snacking from there. Starting small will make it much more approachable and you won’t feel like you’re punishing yourself. It’s okay to like food. Nothing morally wrong about it. No reason to make yourself feel guilty for it. Just keep trying to put better stuff in your body for fuel. 

This may not be applicable to you. But if you smoke weed or drink every night, try to stop doing that. Both of those things make me want to mindlessly eat, and I wake up with swollen fingers from all the garbage I consumed the night before.","Reducing junk food can be tough, but it's definitely doable with some small, consistent changes. Start by identifying when and why you reach for junk food. Is it stress, boredom, or convenience? Once you know your triggers, you can work on addressing them. Try to keep healthier snacks on hand, like fruits or nuts, so you have an easy alternative. Also, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Building new habits takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Focus on making gradual changes rather than going cold turkey, and celebrate your small victories along the way. You've got this!","Making big promises like ""never eating junk food again"" usually backfires because it's too extreme. Instead, try gradually replacing junk food with healthier alternatives while being realistic about the process.

Start by tracking when you typically reach for junk food - is it while watching TV? When stressed? Late at night? Understanding your triggers helps you plan ahead. Keep healthy snacks readily available in those situations, like cut vegetables, fruits, or nuts.

A good approach is the 80/20 rule - aim to eat healthy 80% of the time, while allowing yourself some flexibility for treats. This is more sustainable than trying to quit cold turkey. When you do have junk food, enjoy it mindfully rather than feeling guilty.

Some practical steps that help:
- Don't keep junk food at home - it's easier to avoid temptation
- Meal prep healthy snacks in advance
- Drink water when cravings hit (sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger)
- Find alternative ways to deal with stress or boredom
- Start with small changes, like swapping one processed snack for fruit each day

Remember that building new habits takes time. Focus on progress rather than perfection, and be patient with yourself as you develop healthier eating patterns.","Reducing junk food intake can be tough, especially when it's a deeply ingrained habit. One strategy that might help is to focus on adding healthier options to your diet rather than completely cutting out junk food cold turkey. Try to incorporate more whole foods like fruits, veggies, and lean proteins into your meals, and see if you can find some healthy alternatives to your favorite junk foods. For example, if you love chips, try baking your own sweet potato fries at home. It's also a good idea to identify your triggers - when and where do you usually end up eating junk food? Is it when you're stressed, bored, or around certain people? Once you know your triggers, you can develop a plan to avoid or manage them. Lastly, be kind to yourself and don't give up if you slip up - it's a process to change habits and it's okay to take it one step at a time. What do you think is the first small step you could take towards reducing your junk food intake?","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Breaking the junk food cycle is tough, but definitely doable.

First, instead of a hard ""never,"" try setting smaller, achievable goals. Like, ""I'll only have junk food once this week"" or ""I'll swap my usual chips for a healthier snack three times this week."" Gradual changes are easier to stick with.

Second, think about *why* you're reaching for junk food. Is it stress? Boredom? Identifying the trigger is half the battle. Once you know why, you can find healthier ways to cope. Maybe a quick walk, listening to music, or calling a friend.

Third, don't keep junk food in the house! Out of sight, out of mind really works. Stock up on healthy alternatives you actually enjoy.

Finally, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. It happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Consistency is key, not perfection. You got this!

t3_xhwj1a,[need advice] any unconventional ways to beat brain fog quickly?,"I've seen all the basic stuff like sleep more, diet, exercise, meditation, going to doctor etc. but none of them have really worked, so when brain fog hits I just have to accept I'm worthless and that's getting annoying. I have also tried drinking lots of caffeine and that doesn't help either. The only thing that seems to work most of the time is taking a shower and I can't take a shower like 3 times a day just for brain fog. What can I do? I'm so tired of this",Maybe Vitamin b? A methylated version with multiple variants of b in it worked for me a few years back,Can absolutely second this. Sleep+hydration are the longer term cures imo but a b vitamin will work wonders!!,"Have you tried experimenting with your environment or routine when brain fog hits? Sometimes a change of scenery or a quick walk outside can help reset your mind. You might also want to try a short, focused breathing exercise or a quick session of stretching to get your blood flowing. Another unconventional method is to engage in a brief, stimulating activity like a puzzle or a game that requires concentration. These can sometimes help clear the fog by giving your brain a different kind of workout. Remember, it's about finding what uniquely works for you, so don't hesitate to try different things until you find your go-to solution. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself—you're definitely not worthless!","Have you tried contrast therapy? Since showers help you, you could do a modified version without getting fully wet. Splash very cold water on your face for 30 seconds, then very warm water for 30 seconds, and repeat 3-4 times. This triggers something called the mammalian dive reflex and can help clear brain fog quickly.

Some other unconventional but science-backed approaches: Humming or singing loudly for a minute (increases nitric oxide), doing 20 jumping jacks followed by 5 deep breaths, or putting your head lower than your heart for 30 seconds (increases blood flow to brain). These might look weird but they're quick fixes you can do almost anywhere.

For a desk-friendly option, try the 4-7-8 breathing pattern while making small circles with your eyes. The eye movement helps activate different parts of your brain while the breathing pattern increases oxygen flow.

These aren't permanent solutions, but they're tools you can use when brain fog hits and you need a quick reset. Keep experimenting to find what works best for you - everyone's triggers and solutions are different.","I totally get why you're looking for something beyond the usual advice. It sounds like you've already covered the basics and are eager for some alternative strategies. One thing you might consider is trying a change of environment or sensory experience to help shift your mental state. For example, taking a short walk outside, even just around the block, can sometimes be enough to clear your head. Alternatively, you could try listening to music or nature sounds that you find uplifting or stimulating. Some people also find that doing something creative, like drawing or writing, can help them break out of a brain fog cycle. Since taking a shower seems to work for you, it's possible that the sudden change in temperature or the sensation of the water is what's helping to increase your alertness - you might experiment with other ways to achieve a similar effect, like using a cold compress or taking a few deep breaths of fresh air. It's also worth considering keeping a ""brain fog emergency kit"" on hand, with things like essential oils, a favorite book or joke, or some other small pick-me-up that can help you feel more grounded when you're struggling. Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers and it's great that you're looking for new solutions - don't give up on finding what works for you!","Hey, that sounds super frustrating. It's tough when the standard advice doesn't cut it. Since you've tried the usual suspects, maybe it's time to get a bit more targeted and experimental.

First, instead of just ""diet,"" have you tried keeping a really detailed food journal for a week or two? Note *everything* you eat and drink, and *exactly* when your brain fog hits. You might find a pattern you're missing – like a sensitivity to a specific ingredient or a link to meal timing.

Second, with exercise, are you doing the same thing every time? Maybe your brain needs a different kind of stimulation. Try switching it up – if you always run, try swimming or rock climbing. The novelty might kickstart things.

Third, since showers help, maybe it's the temperature change that's doing the trick? Try splashing cold water on your face or holding an ice pack to the back of your neck when the fog rolls in. It's a quick and accessible way to mimic the shower effect.

Finally, and this is a bit out there, but have you looked into vagus nerve stimulation? There are some simple exercises you can find online (like humming or gargling) that are supposed to help regulate your nervous system and might reduce brain fog.

Don't give up! It's about finding what *specifically* works for *you*. Good luck!

t3_w1tmqm,[Need Advice] Im tired of being where I am and genuinely want to be better.,"I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I'm wasting my potential. It's the first time in my life where the opportunities are there and I have complete control over everything as I am living alone atm. I make all the decisions yet I still find myself stuck in old habits. I have an idea of the kind of life and routines I want to have but am not sure where to start. I have some questions Im trying to figure out, ive listed them below, any advice is appreciated.

1.Is it just better to appropriately plan out everything first, and slowly ease into it all one habit at a time or is it better to just jump straight in with brute force?

2. Is there a way to improve discipline and actually stick to the new habits?

3. What do I do on days that I mess up the routine, how to not get discouraged and continue with it?

I guess I dont really have a ""why"" for all this nor an end goal, all I know is that I just want to be better and improve what I can and see where that takes me. Any general tips or advice relating to the overall topic is also hugely welcomed. Thanks","Hey, I have to work soon so I'll quickly answer your questions

1. I tried brute forcing but end up doing one habit at the time. I learned my lesson now and go one habit at the time
2. Not the answer you probably want, but you need sheer willpower to stick to new habits/quit habits, then your body/mind will want to make the tasks easier so it'll become automatic eventually (it'll become a habit)
3. I often mess up my routine, but it doesn't put you back into square one. How stupid will that be. i.e. I want to develop the habit to save $1000 every month. I managed to do it for a year. I have $12000 saved up. I didn't save the next month, it doesn't put my savings back to $0. I know it's a crude example but it applies to any habit you want to form and messing up once doesn't put you back at square one. Applies to anything really: meditation, journaling, exercise, etc.

&#x200B;

sorry for quick answer lol. My motto (or someone's else) is to put one foot in front of another. You'll get there.",">I have complete control over everything  
>  
>yet I still find myself stuck in old habits

Apparently you don't have complete control. Your pleasure seeking self has some control, your lazy self has some control, you all have some control together.

It's important to create feedback loops. There is a 100% chance that you won't get everything right on your first try. Therefore create mechanisms to constantly correct your plans. There are PDCA cycles, there is scrum, there is journaling. Choose whatever you like, but make sure it lets you create working feedback loops.

Also, don't use brute force. Find good enough reason for everything you do so you don't have to use force.

3) If you set ambitious goals you won't make 100% of what you planned on most days. It's ok. Get used to not being perfect.

>I guess I dont really have a ""why"" for all this nor an end goal, all I know is that I just want to be better and improve what I can

You need to rectify this, because if you don't know where you are going you won't get there. There are many ""being betters"". One may want to get rid of fat to live longer but in other circumstances one may want to put on fat to live longer (famines happened many times in history). So think about and write down your specific objectives first.","Hey there! It's awesome that you're ready to make some changes and take control of your life. Here are some thoughts on your questions:

1. Starting with one habit at a time is usually more sustainable. It helps you focus and build confidence as you see progress. Trying to change everything at once can be overwhelming and lead to burnout. Pick one habit that you think will have the most positive impact and start there.

2. To improve discipline, consistency is key. Set small, achievable goals and gradually increase the challenge as you get more comfortable. Tracking your progress can also be motivating. Apps or a simple journal can help you see how far you've come and keep you accountable.

3. On days you mess up, remember that it's totally normal. The important thing is to not let one off day derail your progress. Reflect on what went wrong, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Progress isn't about being perfect; it's about being persistent.

Since you mentioned not having a ""why,"" maybe spend some time thinking about what truly matters to you and what you want to achieve. Having a clear purpose can be a powerful motivator. Good luck, and remember that improvement is a journey, not a destination!","First off, it's great that you recognize the opportunity in front of you and want to make positive changes. Let me address your questions directly:

For your first question about planning vs jumping in - start small but start now. Pick 1-2 habits you want to build and focus on those for 30 days. Planning is good, but too much planning can become procrastination. The key is to make your initial changes small enough that they feel almost too easy. Want to exercise? Start with 5 minutes daily. Want to read more? Begin with 2 pages per day.

On building discipline and sticking to habits: The most effective approach is to link new habits to existing ones (habit stacking) and make them ridiculously small at first. If you want to meditate, start with taking 3 deep breaths right after brushing your teeth. The smaller the habit, the easier it is for your brain to accept it as part of your routine.

For handling setbacks: Think of your routine like GPS navigation - when you miss a turn, it doesn't tell you to give up and go home. It just recalculates from where you are. If you miss a day, simply resume the next day. No guilt, no making up for lost time, just pick up where you left off.

Not having a specific ""why"" isn't necessarily bad, but you might find it helpful to spend 10 minutes writing down what ""better"" looks like to you. Even if it's vague like ""more energy"" or ""feeling more in control,"" having something concrete can help guide your choices.

Remember: consistency trumps intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to do something big sporadically. Start small, stay consistent, and let the momentum build naturally.","It's great that you're recognizing the need for change and wanting to improve yourself - that's a huge step already. To answer your questions, I'd say it's often a good idea to start by planning out your goals and habits, but not to the point where you get stuck in analysis paralysis. Try to find a balance between planning and taking action. You could start by identifying one or two key habits you want to change or implement, and then create a rough plan for how you'll make that happen. 

As for improving discipline and sticking to new habits, it's all about creating an environment that supports your goals and making small, incremental changes that add up over time. You might consider tracking your progress, finding accountability with a friend or community, and rewarding yourself for small wins along the way.

On days when you mess up, don't be too hard on yourself - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track as soon as possible. Remember that building new habits is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Instead of getting discouraged, try to focus on what you can learn from the experience and how you can improve moving forward.

Not having a clear ""why"" or end goal isn't necessarily a bad thing - sometimes just knowing that you want to be better and improve is enough to get started. As you make progress and build new habits, you may find that your goals and motivations become clearer over time. One general tip I'd offer is to focus on building positive habits rather than trying to cut out negative ones. By adding more good habits to your routine, you'll naturally start to crowd out some of the bad ones. Keep in mind that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things until you find what works for you.","Hey, it's awesome that you're recognizing your potential and wanting to make a change! It's a great first step.

Regarding your questions:

1.  **Easing in vs. Brute Force:** Most people find more success with easing in. ""Brute force"" can lead to burnout. Start with ONE habit. Nail it down. Then add another. Think small, achievable wins. For example, instead of ""workout every day,"" start with ""walk for 20 minutes three times a week.""

2.  **Improving Discipline and Sticking to Habits:** A few things here. First, make your habits ridiculously easy to start. James Clear calls this the ""Two-Minute Rule"" in *Atomic Habits*. If you want to read more, I highly recommend that book. Second, track your progress. Even just a simple checkmark on a calendar can be super motivating. Third, build in accountability. Tell a friend about your goals, or find an online community.

3.  **Messing Up:** Everyone messes up! Don't beat yourself up about it. The key is to get back on track as quickly as possible. If you miss a day, don't let it turn into two. Just acknowledge it, learn from it (what tripped you up?), and get back to it the next day. Don't let a slip-up derail your entire effort.

Since you mentioned not having a ""why"" or end goal, maybe spend some time reflecting on your values. What's truly important to you? What kind of person do you want to be? Connecting your habits to your values can provide a powerful source of motivation. Even just journaling for 10 minutes a day can help you figure this out. Good luck, you got this!

t3_v9ymcq,[Need Advice] I can’t get anything done even if I have the thought of it.,"I have all these dreams and ambitions of all the things I want to do or how my life to be but when it comes to actually doing it, I just give up. I already know some of the things that I could easily do but my brain makes them much more daunting and “more work” than it actually is and then I get tired or bored and just get on Tiktok or my video games. I just don’t know how to change my mind and start doing these things to get better. I feel like I’m slowly losing my joy.","As someone with ADHD+Anxiety, also past substance abuser, this is hella relatable. Not saying you have ADHD or Anxiety just that this is like default operating mode with ADHD and sometimes anxiety, also similar to the patterns in being addicted to something.

Problem is, you probably do know how to change your mind and start doing these things, it’s just that some base level networking in your brain is telling you ‘that will take too long to feel good, so do THIS which will make you feel good right now’ and you’re LETTING it run your life, at least for now. 

It’s not like you’re gonna wake up tomorrow and change it all, but based on a pretty simplified understanding of how brains work; the more you do one thing, the more your brain gets wired to do it. So just start small, be willing to FORGIVE yourself when you fuck up, and remember that it takes time to accomplish any goal. It wouldn’t be a ‘goal’ if you could just do it right now and be done with it. 

Based on that, the best course of action IMO is to accept “yes I’m addicted to shit I don’t like, and I want it to change, but it’s not gonna happen overnight, so I’ll start small”. So if you’re 100% stuck doing the things you don’t like today, tomorrow try and force yourself to do 5% of the things you want to do, and accept that you’ll probably do 95% tiktok and time wasting. Then work towards 10%. Then 20%, and so on and so forth. Overtime, you’ll start building some fucking discipline and drag yourself out of the dopamine seeking hellhole that it sounds like your living in. 

It’s great to aim high over the long term, and maybe you will get there, but for the short term, lower your expectations, and aim for mediocrity, then once you’ve gotten there, start aiming a bit higher each time, just slowly increasing your ability to sustain motivation, determination, and focus at a pace that is OK FOR YOU! Everyone is different, so don’t worry about how long it takes you, just take things one day at a time, or even one hour at a time, and chip away at using video games and tik tok slowly. Just remember those things have no ‘tangible gains’ they are all just fleeting moments of distraction and contentment, just temporary distractions from feelings of unhappiness and lack of content with life. 

When I wanted to turn off the world around me, I would get high, turn to the bottle, blast the music, just to temporarily feel good so I could ignore alll the things that made me feel bad. It’s been nearly 4 years since then, and I still have shitty coping mechanisms to ignore the things I’m not working on and know I need to be, but overtime I’m getting better at it, and maybe somewhat closer to letting any joy in life slip entirely through my fingers.","When you *actually* want to do those things more than your Tiktok and games ... you will.

At the moment, you'd rather play games ... so you do. 

You like the *idea* of wanting to do all those other things ... but you don't actually want to 

You want to play games ... so you do.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common struggle, and you're definitely not alone in this. One thing that might help is breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of focusing on the big picture, try to identify the very first, smallest action you can take. For example, if you want to start a new project, maybe the first step is just opening a document and writing a title. 

Also, try setting a timer for just 5 or 10 minutes to work on something. Often, just getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in the flow, it becomes easier to keep going. 

Another tip is to create a routine or schedule that includes time for both work and play. This way, you can enjoy your downtime guilt-free, knowing you've already made progress on your goals. 

Lastly, consider limiting distractions by setting specific times for TikTok or gaming, so they become rewards rather than default activities. Remember, building discipline is a gradual process, and every small step counts. You've got this!","Hey there - what you're describing is super common, especially with how addictive things like TikTok and games are designed to be. The good news is you can absolutely turn this around, starting with small steps.

First, make things as easy as possible to start. Instead of thinking about your big dreams and getting overwhelmed, pick ONE tiny thing you want to do tomorrow. Something that takes 5 minutes or less. Maybe it's reading one page of a book, doing 5 pushups, or writing three sentences. The key is making it so small it feels almost ridiculous to not do it.

Next, put your phone in another room when you want to get that small task done. Don't rely on willpower - just remove the temptation entirely. You can get back to TikTok after, but give yourself those few minutes of focused time first.

As you build confidence with tiny wins, gradually increase what you take on. The most important thing is consistency over intensity. It's better to do something small every day than to burn yourself out trying to change everything at once.

Your brain is currently wired for instant gratification from social media and games. That's okay - you just need to slowly rewire it by proving to yourself you can follow through on small commitments. Each time you do, you'll build momentum and start feeling more capable of tackling bigger goals.

Start today with choosing that one tiny action for tomorrow. What's it going to be?","It sounds like you're struggling with a common obstacle - the gap between intention and action. One strategy that might help is to break down your goals into ridiculously small, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking ""I want to achieve X,"" try telling yourself ""I'll do Y for 10 minutes today."" This can make the task less daunting and help you build momentum. For example, if you want to start writing a book, your initial goal could be as simple as opening a document and typing a single sentence. Additionally, consider implementing a ""2-minute rule"" - if a task can be done in less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This can help you build the habit of taking action without getting bogged down by procrastination. It's also important to identify your why - what's driving your desire to make these changes? What will achieving your goals mean for your life and happiness? Reminding yourself of your underlying motivations can help you stay focused and motivated. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you get distracted - it's a normal part of the process. Just acknowledge the setback and gently refocus your attention on your goal. You're not alone in this struggle, and small steps can add up over time to make a big difference.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is fighting against what you actually want. One thing that's helped me is breaking down those big ""dreams and ambitions"" into ridiculously small, almost laughably easy steps. Seriously. Want to write a book? Commit to writing *one sentence* a day. Want to get in shape? Do *one* push-up. The point isn't the sentence or the push-up itself, it's building the habit of *starting*.

Once you've done that tiny thing, you might find it easier to do a little more. And if you don't, that's okay too! You still accomplished your goal for the day. Also, try to identify the specific triggers that lead you to TikTok or video games. Is it a certain time of day? A certain feeling? Once you know the triggers, you can try to replace those habits with something slightly more productive, or at least less draining. Good luck, you got this!

t3_tcbq0o,[Need Advice] I know what it feels to have a winning mentality but i just cant keep it consistent. Please Help,"Ok so, the past 5 years ive learnt alot about myself. And the most important thing that I've learnt is that i have a winning mentality that goes and comes. However, i am in no control over this winning mentality and how to zone in and zone out of it when needed. 

To explain a little bit more, i want to tell a little about my performances, them being academic. 
In my high school, i had no mentality and was little cocky and over confident. Got less than average grades. Couldn't get accepted in a good college. And had to study for my first year of college by MYSELF and give exams as an individual privately, which is an option for failures like me. I don't know how to say it but it felt like a fuse just lit up in me and i was fucking studying hard. Turns out, that was my best performance ever. I had the best possible grade in all of my first year college exams studying by myself. Immediately, after that i got into a college for my second year with a full scholarship. But, i had lost my winning mentality and couldnt zone in on it. I had basically zoned out of it and possibly permanently. Got above average grades but i know that i performed no way near my first year. Finished college with very respectable grades (mainly because of my lion mentality in my first year). 

And since then, ive only ever felt that druve and mentality once for my uni exams. Can't seem to zone in and zone out when i want.

Its like i have tiny incompetent men inside my head controlling my mentality and they just turn it on when they want and im so fucking frustrated that i cant zone in and out when i want.

Please help. P.S im not a natuve english speaker, so please excuse my grammar mistakes","I think your problem might be with accountability.  


I thought this to myself within the first paragraph of your post.  


The expression you used ""i am in no control over this winning mentality"" says everything.  


That expression takes power away from you. It's easy to say you can't help it, or that you can't control it, but at the end of the day, you can. You just haven't been able to.  


Also, if you don't believe you can keep it consistent, then you won't be able to. Whatever you believe will be what ends up happening.  


So, the first thing you should do about this is to hold yourself accountable. It is your fault you can't stay consistent and you just need to do better in the future.  


Now, after that, once you recognize you have full control over your own actions, then it's time to think WHY it is that you're feeling such a strong resistance. Is your life lacking balance? Are you having enough fun? Or are you just wearing yourself down?  


Could this be a motivational thing? Maybe you're just not as intrinsically motivated to have the best performance possible academically. How much does that matter to you and why does it matter?

&#x200B;

Having your WHY extremely clear will help you a lot.  


Also, you should try to analyze what were the factors that contributed to your epic performance in the past. Try to figure out what were the difference makers and then try to replicate it.  


Hope this can be of some help! Wish you the best","Im on the same boat as you, but from what I have seen in this sub building up a plan and sticking to it is the most important part about consistency. I have committed to some plans before, but never really sticked to them. Maybe someone already with the mentality of being consistent could helps us out how to stick to these routines, because, for me at least, that's the hardest part of the plan everytime.","It sounds like you've experienced some incredible highs and frustrating lows with your motivation and focus. The key to maintaining a consistent ""winning mentality"" often lies in building habits and routines that support your goals, even when you're not feeling that initial spark. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down what you want to achieve into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to stay focused and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.

2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and self-care. Consistency in your daily habits can help maintain your focus and drive.

3. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on what's working and what's not. Adjust your strategies as needed to keep moving forward.

4. **Stay Accountable**: Share your goals with a friend or join a study group. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and on track.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can boost your confidence and keep you motivated.

Remember, it's normal for motivation to fluctuate. The goal is to build a system that keeps you moving forward, even when you're not feeling at your peak. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've already shown you can achieve great things!","That ""winning mentality"" you experienced wasn't random - it came from a genuine sense of urgency and necessity during your first year. When you had to study privately, failure wasn't an option, and that pressure created intense focus and drive.

The key is understanding that discipline doesn't rely on motivation or mentality - it's about building systems and habits that work regardless of how you feel. Instead of trying to recapture that specific mental state, focus on creating a consistent routine and environment that supports your goals.

Start small. Set specific study times and stick to them even when you don't feel like it. Create a dedicated study space. Break down your work into manageable chunks. Use techniques like the Pomodoro method (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to maintain concentration.

Track your progress daily, even if it's just marking an X on a calendar for completing your planned study session. This builds momentum and makes it easier to stay consistent.

Remember - your first-year success wasn't magic or luck. It was the result of sustained effort and focus. You can recreate those results through deliberate practice and consistent habits, rather than waiting for the right mentality to strike.

The good news is you've proven to yourself that you're capable of excellence. Now it's about building a reliable system to access that capability consistently, rather than leaving it to chance.","It sounds like you've experienced periods of high motivation and performance, but struggle to sustain them. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you've identified your ""winning mentality"" and have had successes with it, especially during your first year of college. 

One potential strategy to help you tap into this mentality more consistently is to reflect on what triggered it in the past. Was it the feeling of being an underdog, having to study by yourself? Was it the pressure of needing to perform well for a scholarship? Identifying these triggers might help you recreate the conditions that led to your success.

Another approach could be to develop a pre-performance routine that signals to your brain that it's time to get into ""winning mode."" This could be something as simple as a specific workout, a particular book or podcast, or even just a consistent morning routine. The idea is to create a mental association between these activities and your desired state of mind.

It might also be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks, and focus on building momentum through consistent progress rather than relying on bursts of motivation. This can help you stay on track even when you're not feeling fully ""zoned in.""

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about not being able to control your mentality all the time. It's normal for motivation to ebb and flow, and it's possible that your brain is just wired to respond to certain challenges or pressures. By experimenting with different strategies and being patient with yourself, you might find ways to tap into your ""winning mentality"" more often. Keep in mind that it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to understand yourself better.","Hey, it sounds like you've experienced some real highs and lows, and it's frustrating when you can't consistently tap into that ""winning mentality."" It's great that you recognize this pattern in yourself.

Instead of thinking about it as a switch you can flip on and off, maybe try focusing on building consistent habits and routines. That way, you're not relying on a fleeting feeling, but on a system that supports you even when you don't ""feel"" like it.

Think about what specifically helped you succeed during that first year of college. Was it a specific study schedule? A certain environment? Identifying those concrete factors can help you recreate them.

Also, break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Big goals can feel overwhelming, and that can kill motivation. Smaller steps make progress feel more achievable, which can build momentum and confidence.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Everyone struggles with consistency. Don't beat yourself up when you have off days. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Good luck!

t3_14540xn,"[Need Advice] How do you cope having a busy, stressful life and a good sex life","I find myself either too stressed or too tired to be sexually aroused when I'm putting so much effort in to organising my tasks, completing tasks, keeping up daily habits and putting the work in to reach my goals.

I find I can't switch off at any point and I'm always thinking about what I could be doing to improve my chances of success. The wife is feeling neglected in bedroom because I've always got other things on my mind and am really tired from a busy day. We always get to bed too late anyway because we've got so much to do, I only get about 5-6 hours a night

I also suffer from anxiety disorder so its extremely difficult to relax at any point and I need to be relaxed to be aroused.

I feel like the only thing that would work would be to completely give up my goals and live entirely on getting pleasure in the present. I can't balance at all.","It's a task- schedule time every week to spend time together, whether that's a date night or just going to bed early. Sometimes the mood is right and it works, sometimes it isn't but you still get to hang out and connect.",Sounds like you need to think about priorities.,"It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable that it can be tough to find balance. One thing that might help is setting some boundaries around your work and personal time. Try to establish a ""cut-off"" time in the evening where you stop working and start winding down. This can help you mentally switch gears and be more present with your wife. Also, consider scheduling specific times for intimacy, just like you would any other important task. It might feel a bit unromantic at first, but it can help ensure that you’re making time for each other. 

Additionally, working on your sleep schedule could make a big difference. Aim for 7-8 hours if possible, as being well-rested can improve your mood and energy levels. Lastly, incorporating some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, even for just a few minutes a day, might help manage your anxiety and make it easier to relax. Remember, it's about small, consistent changes rather than overhauling everything at once. Good luck!","This is actually a really common challenge - the tension between achievement/productivity and intimacy. But you don't have to choose between your goals and your relationship. The key is treating intimacy as one of your priorities rather than seeing it as competing with them.

First, you need more sleep. 5-6 hours isn't enough and it's affecting everything - your stress levels, anxiety, and libido. Try to establish a firm bedtime that allows for 7-8 hours. This might mean ruthlessly cutting some evening activities, but it's worth it.

Schedule dedicated time with your wife where you both agree to put phones away and just focus on each other. Even 30 minutes of genuine connection can make a huge difference. This isn't ""wasted"" time - it's investing in your relationship, which is just as important as other goals.

For the anxiety and difficulty relaxing, consider adding a wind-down routine before bed. This could be 15-20 minutes of meditation, light stretching, or whatever helps you decompress. The goal is to create a mental shift from ""doing mode"" to ""being mode.""

Remember that intimacy doesn't always have to be spontaneous or lengthy. Sometimes a quick connection is better than waiting for the ""perfect"" moment that never comes. Talk openly with your wife about this - she might have ideas about what would work for both of you.

Your goals matter, but so does your relationship. Finding balance isn't about giving up either - it's about being intentional with your time and energy. Start with getting more sleep and creating dedicated connection time, then adjust based on what works for you both.","It sounds like you're struggling to find a balance between your driven personality and your personal life, especially when it comes to intimacy with your wife. One potential strategy could be to schedule dedicated time for relaxation and connection with your partner, just as you would any other important task or goal. This might mean setting aside device-free time before bed, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation to help calm your mind, or even just taking a few minutes each day to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the future. 

It's also worth considering how you can prioritize sleep - those 5-6 hours a night are likely exacerbating your stress and anxiety levels, making it even harder to relax and be present. Could you work with your wife to establish a consistent bedtime routine that allows for more rest and sets you both up for success? 

Lastly, it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around goals and pleasure - rather than seeing them as mutually exclusive, could you find ways to make progress towards your goals that also bring you joy and fulfillment, or that allow for more quality time with your wife? It's not necessarily about giving up on your aspirations, but about finding a more sustainable and balanced approach that nourishes all areas of your life.","Hey, that sounds like a really tough situation, and you're definitely not alone in struggling to balance ambition with personal life. It's great that you're recognizing the issue and looking for solutions.

First, let's address the sleep. 5-6 hours isn't enough for most people, especially with anxiety. Prioritizing sleep, even by just an extra hour, can make a huge difference in your stress levels and overall energy. Maybe try setting a ""wind-down"" alarm an hour before bed to signal it's time to stop working and start relaxing.

Second, you mentioned always thinking about what you could be doing. That's a classic anxiety symptom, and it bleeds into your personal life. Have you considered incorporating mindfulness or meditation into your daily routine? Even 10 minutes a day can help you learn to quiet the mental chatter and be more present in the moment, which could help with arousal and connection with your wife. There are tons of free apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you.

Third, instead of thinking about completely giving up your goals, maybe try reframing them. Are they truly *your* goals, or are they driven by external pressures? Could you break them down into smaller, more manageable steps? This might make them feel less overwhelming and free up some mental space. Also, schedule in dedicated ""couple time"" just like you schedule in work tasks. Put it on the calendar and treat it as a non-negotiable appointment.

Finally, and this is important, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage it more effectively, which will benefit all areas of your life, including your relationship. It's not a sign of weakness to ask for help; it's a sign of strength. Good luck, you've got this!

t3_uz00bj,"[Need Advice] 23 m, I am exiting a really really fucked up period of my life, would love to get some advices","Hi everyone, I was into a self improvement journey in January and February, I feel like things were going quite okay until I basically decided to fuck up everything.
I don’t know how it happened but at a certain point in March and April I did the following things:
- I started smoking weed on a weekly basis
- Stopped going to the gym
- Started dating a lot of girls at the same time (who I didn’t even care about in the first place) and had sex with a really bad girl, who I didn’t know anything about and who used cocaine.
- Started compulsively looking for a job, I am a student at university but I always thought that having a job could have helped me when comparing to others / my inferiority complex.
Then, at a certain point, I found myself with an health problem (probably due to stress + sex with that girl) which seems to be nearly solved now, or at least under control. This problem made me not think about all the things above, which I basically stopped.
Next week I will probably go again at my parents home because uni will finish for this period and so I will have 3/4 months in which I don’t have any idea about what to do, which can help me for the future / self-improvement while providing fun. In my country it’s quite too late to find a job and they don’t do summer internships so I would exclude this option. Thanks for everybody who will answer this.","Setbacks are just part of growing. Dust yourself off and try again. Honestly don't even worry about taking two steps forward for every step back, if you aim for 1.1 steps you'll still come out ahead.

Also, a word of advice from someone older: You're never going to look back on your 20s and wish you had less sex. As long as everyone is safe and enthusiastically consenting, it'll not always be great, but experimenting is what your 20s are for. You've got a *minimum* of ten years before people will start to think it's weird lol.","Take it from someone almost twice your age: Everything you just listed is completely normal at 23 years old. If you’re 50 and doing this type of crap, then it’s a problem. 

Find your balance man, your 20’s if for doing shit like this. Find and understand your limits while you have time in life to recover easily from any hard lessons. The older you get, the harder it is to bounce back in every way.","Hey there! It sounds like you've been through a lot, but it's great that you're looking to get back on track. Here are a few ideas to help you make the most of your summer:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small daily or weekly goals. It could be as simple as reading a book, learning a new skill online, or getting back into a fitness routine. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Re-establish a Routine**: Try to create a daily schedule that includes time for exercise, hobbies, and relaxation. Having a routine can provide structure and help you stay focused.

3. **Explore New Hobbies**: Use this time to explore interests you haven't had time for. Whether it's learning a new language, cooking, or picking up an instrument, it can be both fun and fulfilling.

4. **Volunteer**: If jobs and internships are off the table, consider volunteering. It's a great way to gain experience, meet new people, and make a positive impact.

5. **Reflect and Plan**: Take some time to reflect on what you've learned from the past few months and plan for the future. What do you want to achieve in the next year? How can you set yourself up for success?

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. What's important is that you're taking steps to move forward. Good luck!","First off, props for recognizing that period wasn't great for you and wanting to make positive changes. That self-awareness is actually a really good starting point.

Those 3-4 months at home can be a perfect reset opportunity. Since you mentioned having success with self-improvement earlier this year, you already know you're capable of it. The key is creating structure and positive momentum.

Here's what I'd suggest for your summer: Start with a simple morning routine - maybe 30 mins of exercise (doesn't have to be gym, could be running or bodyweight stuff), followed by 15 mins of planning your day. Pick up a skill that interests you and could be useful later - coding, a language, whatever catches your interest. Set aside specific hours for this daily.

The job/internship situation might be tricky timing-wise, but you could use this time to build your resume in other ways - maybe an online certification, personal project, or volunteering. This gives you something concrete to show for your summer while addressing that comparison mindset more productively.

Most importantly, take it one day at a time. You don't need to figure out everything at once. Focus on building consistent, healthy habits first. When September rolls around, you'll be in a much better position to tackle university life with stronger foundations.

Remember that setbacks don't define you - it's how you respond to them that matters. You've already taken the first step by wanting to change course. Now it's just about putting one foot in front of the other.","It sounds like you've been through a tough period, but recognizing the issues and wanting to make a change is a huge step forward. First, congratulations on stopping the behaviors that were holding you back, especially with the health scare - that can be a really wake-up call. Now, with 3-4 months ahead of you, this could be a great opportunity to refocus on your self-improvement journey. Since job hunting and internships might not be viable options right now, why not use this time to revisit your goals and priorities? You could start by setting small, achievable objectives for yourself, like getting back into a gym routine or picking up a new hobby. It's also important to address the underlying issues that led you astray in the first place, such as your inferiority complex - consider journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist to work through these feelings. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about the past few months - everyone has setbacks, and it's how you learn from them that matters. Use this time to recharge, reflect, and come back stronger. What do you think is the first step you'll take to get back on track?","Hey man, it sounds like you went through a rough patch, but the good news is you're aware of it and want to get back on track. That's the first and biggest step.

Since you have 3-4 months free, this is a great opportunity. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on. Maybe it's getting back to the gym consistently. Or maybe it's exploring a new hobby that genuinely interests you, something that isn't tied to external validation.

Think about *why* you fell off track. You mentioned feeling inferior and compulsively looking for a job. Address that underlying feeling. Maybe journaling, meditation, or even talking to a therapist could help you understand those feelings better.

As for the summer, consider learning a new skill online. There are tons of free or low-cost courses available. It's productive, engaging, and can boost your confidence. Also, think about volunteering. Helping others can be a great way to get out of your head and feel good about yourself.

Don't beat yourself up about the past. Learn from it, and focus on building better habits one step at a time. You got this.

t3_u23ck7,[Need Advice] I can't make myself do anything and my life is falling apart,"
I don't seem to have the will power or the ability to make myself do the things I need to do live my life productively.  And even when I do build up a last resort ""you need to do this *now*"" feeling, I feel so physically tired it makes doing anything a complete slog unless I give myself caffeine or something to get me going.  I usually get enough sleep.  6-8 hours most nights. But every day I just feel so physically and mentally tired.  

I ""work"" 40 hours a week, or at least my company thinks i do, but in reality I probably spend 10-15 hours a week actually working.  The rest I spend sitting around mostly on my phone. At times this punishes me. Especially when I have a workday where realistically I could come in and really work for 4 hours and be out by lunch, but instead I sit around for 6 hours and end up pulling a 10 hour day to compensate as I rush to do everything last minute. 

I struggle to do some of the most basic things. Everybody's main advice always seems to be ""well just do it"" but I can't make myself sometimes. I know that sounds pathetic but when I need to do something like clean a room, work, whatever I panic and escape into my phone or something else.  

I do have a history of depression dating back the past 12 years or so but I honestly think it's gotten better the past few.  I rarely have badly depressed days now, think I'm just kind of numb at this point. 

I'm making this post because it's beginning to effect those around me as well. Recently my SO made a comment at home (and they never ever make comments like this) about how it would be nice if I could do more than just the dishes once a week at home. I'm sitting here now with the mindset of ""yes! Of course! I'll be better about everything immediately!"" but I know as soon as I'm home ill be so worn out for absolutely no reason and I'll just flop onto a chair or the couch and remain there for the most part until bed.  I dont want to be this way but it's like there's this pulling force of laziness and numbness to pressing matters that just pulls me downwards into a spiral of uselessness that's beginning to impact anything and everyone around me.  

I shower once  or twice a week now. I brush my teeth once a day but honestly I missed it the past 24h.  I need help.  

Sorry this post is so jumbled.  I just got down what I could in a moment of clarity. ",Have you been screened for ADHD? This sounds like it might be some of that under the depression. I've got this kind... constant overwhelm leading to indefinite burnout and exhaustion. :(,"I read that feeling like I wrote it myself. It's dreadful - this feeling of nothingness that doesnt bring enough joy to get me off my ass and doing what I need to do. I live in a constant state of absolute extreme anxiety. I will be late anywhere I go no matter how many hours early I get up. I watch tiktoks and Tedtalks of people doing the shit that seems like fun but I cannot bring myself to do a single thing. It's not just dishes and showering- it's everything. I have nothing to look forward too and no sense of purpose to make me feel like actually trying to enjoy my time. Mindfulness seems to be lost on me the more and more I try it. Life is dull and boring and I've felt as if I was in a prison since I was a very young child. I long for this indescrible feeling yet I don't have any motivation to do anything about it. No passions , no dreams and I don't even know where to start to find them. I can't tell if I feel everything or nothing and it's damaged every single relationship in my life. Too which I reply , 'well I was gonna fuck that up eventually so might as well just take a full day nap on my precious day off. ' 

I wish I had advice to give you. If I ever find anything I will be right back here and you will be the very first person to know. If it helps in even the smallest way , you are not alone. I too am suffering every single day , and some of them can get very dark feeling like this all by myself.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you get started:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one small task to focus on each day. It could be as simple as making your bed or brushing your teeth twice a day. Small wins can build momentum and help you feel more in control.

2. **Set a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but having a structure can help reduce decision fatigue and make it easier to get things done.

3. **Limit Phone Time**: Consider setting specific times when you can use your phone, or use apps that limit screen time. This can help reduce distractions and make it easier to focus on tasks.

4. **Energy Levels**: Since you’re feeling tired, it might be worth looking into your diet, hydration, and exercise habits. Sometimes small changes in these areas can boost energy levels.

5. **Seek Support**: If you’re comfortable, talk to your SO about how you’re feeling. They might be able to offer support or help you stay accountable.

6. **Professional Help**: Since you mentioned a history of depression, it might be helpful to check in with a mental health professional. They can offer guidance tailored to your situation.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","Hey there - what you're describing sounds really rough, but it's good that you're reaching out and recognizing you want to make changes. The exhaustion + procrastination cycle is brutal, and ""just do it"" isn't helpful advice when you're stuck in that pattern.

First, given your history of depression and current symptoms (exhaustion, numbness, hygiene struggles), it would be worth checking in with a doctor. Constant fatigue despite adequate sleep can have medical causes that need addressing.

For building better habits, start incredibly small. Don't try to transform everything at once. Pick ONE tiny habit - something that takes 2 minutes or less. Maybe it's putting one dish away right after using it, or wiping down one counter before bed. The goal isn't the task itself, but building the ""muscle"" of following through on what you plan to do.

For work productivity, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5 minute break. Start with just one pomodoro per day. Put your phone in another room during that time. Having a clear start/stop time makes tasks feel more manageable.

When you notice yourself reaching for your phone to escape, pause and take 3 deep breaths. Name what you're feeling (""I'm feeling overwhelmed about cleaning""). This creates a tiny gap between impulse and action where you can choose differently.

Remember that discipline isn't about willpower - it's about systems and small wins that compound over time. You don't need to become a productivity machine overnight. Focus on small, consistent actions that move you in the right direction.

Consider sharing your goals with your SO and asking for their support. Having someone to be accountable to and celebrate small victories with can make a big difference.

You can absolutely turn this around. Take it one tiny step at a time.","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of motivation, productivity, and possibly some underlying mental health issues that are affecting your daily life. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help, so kudos to you for taking this step.

Given your history of depression, it's possible that your current state is related to that, even if you feel like you've been doing better lately. The numbness you mentioned can be a symptom of depression, and it might be contributing to your lack of motivation.

Rather than trying to tackle everything at once, let's start with small, achievable goals. For example, you could try setting a daily routine that includes some basic self-care activities like showering, brushing your teeth, and getting dressed. These small wins can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.

It might also be helpful to explore the reasons behind your procrastination and escapism. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving these behaviors, you can start working on strategies to overcome them.

In terms of your work habits, it might be helpful to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day. This can help make your work feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

Lastly, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these issues and develop strategies for building motivation and productivity. They can also help you address any underlying mental health concerns that might be contributing to your current state.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to do this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you in getting back on track.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a huge first step. It's easy to get stuck in those cycles of avoidance and numbness.

First, that feeling of being physically and mentally tired all the time? Definitely worth getting a checkup with a doctor. Rule out any underlying medical issues like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. It could be a simple fix.

Second, let's break down the ""just do it"" advice, because it's rarely that simple. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on *tiny* wins. Seriously tiny. Like, ""I will stand up and walk to the kitchen"" tiny. Or ""I will brush my teeth *right now*."" The goal isn't to accomplish a ton, it's to break the inertia and build momentum. Once you're up, maybe you rinse a dish. Maybe you don't. The point is you broke the cycle.

For work, try the Pomodoro Technique. Work for 25 minutes, *fully focused*, then take a 5-minute break to mess around on your phone. Knowing the break is coming can make those focused bursts more manageable. Track your focused time. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day at first, you'll see progress, and that's motivating.

Regarding your SO's comment, instead of promising a complete turnaround (which sets you up for failure), have an honest conversation. Explain you're struggling and actively working on it. Maybe suggest tackling one small chore together each day. It's less pressure and builds connection.

Finally, about the depression history: even if you feel ""numb"" rather than actively depressed, it's worth talking to a therapist. They can give you tools to manage the avoidance and build healthier coping mechanisms. You've recognized the problem, and that's half the battle. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You got this.

t3_s2mn65,[need advice] how do you ppl get the energy to cook on weekdays?!,"Before you say, cook on weekends. I’ve tried meal prepping once a week and it makes me feel a bit gross to eat stale food. So my ideal routine would include 2 meal prep  per week. 


I finished work this evening and I’m exhausted.  And not just physically, it’s just my eyes are tired from looking at a screen all day long. When my eyes feel tired, i know I’m out for the day.  If I’m just physically tired, i can still push through.
I’ve decided to stop ordering takeouts and eating healthier (to help with energy). And i dont want to make cheat meals full of empty nutrients. 

If you’ve managed to make this work in your routine, any tips?","Blue apron helps me because I know if I don't cook I'll lose meals. Other than that, the answer is wine and not having energy for anything else 😆","1. Make rice, stew etc for 3-5 days on weekends (3 cups of rice is enough for 1 person) 
2. Prep everything on the weekends. Marinade what you can for Mon & tuesday. 
3. Literally, just steam your marinated meat and veggies, heat up your rice. Leave it on the stove for 10-20 mins and you're ready to eat it.

It's a lot less work than it seems. You don't have to do much.

I'll try kimchi, because I think you can keep it for months.","I totally get where you're coming from—after a long day, the last thing you want to do is cook. Here are a few ideas that might help: 

1. **Simplify Your Meals**: Focus on recipes that are quick and easy but still healthy. Think stir-fries, salads, or one-pot meals that take 20-30 minutes max. 

2. **Batch Prep Ingredients**: Instead of full meals, prep ingredients twice a week. Chop veggies, marinate proteins, or cook grains in advance. This way, you can mix and match to create fresh meals quickly.

3. **Use a Slow Cooker or Instant Pot**: These can be lifesavers. You can throw everything in before work and come home to a ready meal. Plus, they often make enough for leftovers that don’t feel stale.

4. **Set a Routine**: Try to set a specific time for cooking, like right after work. It might be tough at first, but once it becomes a habit, it’ll feel less like a chore.

5. **Incorporate Breaks**: If screen fatigue is a big issue, take short breaks during the day to rest your eyes. This might help you feel less drained by the evening.

Remember, it's all about finding what works for you and making small adjustments. Good luck!","Here's what's worked really well for me with weekday cooking: start super simple and gradually build up. Instead of jumping straight into complex meal prep, focus on quick, nutritious meals that take 15-20 minutes max.

Some game-changers: keep pre-chopped vegetables in the fridge (way easier than meal prep, still fresh), and always have eggs, canned beans, and quick-cooking proteins on hand. A simple stir-fry with pre-cut veggies and chicken takes barely any time. Sheet pan dinners are also great - just toss everything on a pan and let the oven do the work while you rest your eyes.

For the screen fatigue, try the 20-20-20 rule during work: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It makes a huge difference in evening energy levels.

The key is making cooking as effortless as possible when you're tired. Start with just 2-3 really simple recipes you can make on autopilot. Once those become habit, you can expand your repertoire. Remember, a basic homemade meal is still way better than takeout, so don't feel pressure to make anything fancy.

Also, consider doing the bare minimum prep (like washing vegetables or marinating meat) in the morning when you're fresher. Even 5 minutes of morning prep makes evening cooking much more manageable.","I totally get where you're coming from - it can be tough to muster up the energy to cook after a long day of staring at screens. One thing that's helped me is to keep my weekday meals super simple, like one-pot wonders or stir-fries that can be whipped up in 20-30 minutes. That way, I'm not feeling overwhelmed by a complicated recipe when I'm already exhausted. 

Another strategy you might consider is breaking down your cooking into smaller tasks, like chopping veggies or marinating proteins, that you can do at different times of the day when you have a bit more energy. Then, when it's time to cook, it feels less daunting because some of the prep work is already done.

Since you're looking to do two meal preps per week, you might also think about cooking in bulk on those days, but then portioning out individual servings that can be reheated quickly throughout the week. That way, you're not eating ""stale"" food, but you're still getting the benefits of having healthy meals ready to go. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if some nights you just can't cook - it's okay to have a backup plan, like a simple salad or some scrambled eggs, that requires minimal effort but still gets you a nutritious meal. Good luck with your new routine!","Hey, I totally get the weekday cooking struggle after a long day of screen time. It's rough! Here's what's worked for me:

First, instead of thinking of it as ""meal prep,"" try ""ingredient prep."" Chop veggies, cook grains, or marinate proteins on your prep days. That way, during the week, you're just assembling things, not starting from scratch. It feels fresher than fully prepped meals.

Second, embrace quick & easy recipes. Think stir-fries, sheet pan dinners, or big salads. These can be thrown together in under 30 minutes. Websites like Budget Bytes or Skinnytaste have tons of ideas.

Third, consider your ""eye fatigue"" trigger. Maybe blue light glasses or adjusting your screen brightness could help you feel less drained at the end of the day. Even a short break away from the screen every hour can make a difference. If you can tackle the eye fatigue, you might find you have more energy overall.

Finally, be kind to yourself. If you slip up and order takeout one night, don't beat yourself up. Just get back on track the next day. It's about progress, not perfection. Good luck!

t3_117ogi5,"High motivation, then complete procrastination. Burn out or inconsistency? [Need Advice]","Hey all, I've been browsing for a bit so I get the general idea of this sub-reddit. Many of my creative projects like programming, 3d modeling, game design, etc. I have a huge burst of motivation, energy, where I get a lot done in a short time frame, even being able to sit down and produce meaningful progress on many of them. Then follows maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe months of inactivity on them and I move onto another project, just eventually getting into that cycle all over again.

I've tried to completely draw out my schedule, as in, what needs to get done, at what time, by what day, the description, all that. Yet I always fail to complete them (strangely enough though this doesn't really happen to me with writing). I feel like it's a mixture of burn out, frustration, and maybe incompetence? Once I hit a roadblock that I can't overcome after a decent amount of time, or having to learn a completely new library, plugin, leads to procrastination on my part. Of course, I do know that I am procrastinating during this, but anytime I try to force myself to sit down and think and get back into a similar state of mind when I was actually making progress, my mind starts to wander, and I eventually give up.

It also doesn't help that generally I'm much slower at making progress than I should. For example, it could take me 2 hours to finish a math homework that should only take 45 minutes or less, even if I completely understand the material and get the right answers. It's not like I CAN'T overcome the problem, it's just that I lose all motivation to even attempt the hours long debug or learning of something else after my initial burst. I've done this off-and-on for about since I was 13-14, so 2-3 years. It makes me sad to think about how if I were just consistent in my hobbies, I'd probably be really good at them, but I'm just not.

It would really help to receive some advice about this, sorry for the bad formatting. I might've also forgotten to provide details or such that would be helpful to give advice on, but I'm very quick to respond so please just ask. 

Also generally, I want the discussion of advice to be about trying to figure out what it is in my mind that stops me from being consistent. I don't really want to be given a schedule or a plan or something like that. I've probably already tried it, and I'd much rather just want to find out the reason, like if I were burning out from doing too much work in such a short timeframe.","My initial thought is that this may not be a discipline issue. It potentially sounds like ADD or ADHD, and is a pretty common experience for those of us who have it. Is there a way you can get tested? If so, that would open up a number of resources (specialized counselors, medication) that would help.","Have a similar issue once i get my project to 70-80% completion I happend to drop them. Mostly because something else came along.
I face this only with personals projects not with my professional stuff i do.","It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common cycle of high motivation followed by a drop-off, which can be frustrating. One thing that might help is focusing on building a habit of consistency rather than relying on motivation. Motivation is great for getting started, but habits are what keep you going when motivation dips. Try setting very small, manageable goals for each day, even if it's just 15 minutes of work on a project. This can help you build a routine without feeling overwhelmed. Also, consider reflecting on what specifically causes you to lose interest or hit a roadblock. Is it boredom, frustration, or something else? Understanding this can help you develop strategies to push through those moments. Lastly, remember that progress is progress, no matter how slow it feels. Keep at it, and over time, those small efforts will add up.","What you're describing sounds like a classic case of relying too heavily on motivation rather than building sustainable habits. Those initial bursts of energy feel great, but they often lead to burnout because you're trying to do too much too quickly.

Instead of going all-in during motivation spikes, try deliberately limiting yourself to shorter, consistent work periods. For example, commit to just 25 minutes of focused work on a project each day, even if you feel like you could do more. This might feel frustratingly slow at first, but it's much more sustainable than the boom-bust cycle you're currently experiencing.

The roadblocks you hit with technical learning are totally normal - everyone faces them. The key difference is treating them as expected parts of the process rather than motivation-killers. When you hit one, break it down into smaller chunks. Instead of ""learn this entire library,"" make it ""understand just this one basic function today.""

Your slower pace isn't necessarily a problem - it's actually an opportunity to build patience and consistency. Rather than comparing yourself to how fast you ""should"" be going, focus on showing up regularly. Even 15 minutes of daily progress will get you further than sporadic bursts followed by weeks of nothing.

Consider tracking your work sessions (just time spent, not necessarily output). This can help you spot patterns in when you tend to drop off and adjust accordingly. The goal isn't perfection - it's building a sustainable practice that you can maintain long-term.

Remember: consistency beats intensity every time. Start small, stay steady, and let the compound effects work in your favor.","It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of the ""sprint and stall"" cycle, where you pour all your energy into a project for a short burst, only to lose momentum and struggle to get back on track. I think it's great that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to understand what's driving it, rather than just trying to force yourself into a schedule.

One thing that stands out to me is your mention of hitting roadblocks or having to learn new things, and how that leads to procrastination. It's possible that you're experiencing a fear of not being able to overcome these challenges, or a fear of not being good enough, which is causing you to disengage from the project altogether. This could be related to a fixed mindset, where you believe your abilities are innate and unchangeable, rather than a growth mindset, where you see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.

Another possibility is that you're simply not giving yourself permission to work at a slower pace, or to make mistakes. You mention feeling like you should be able to finish tasks more quickly, but maybe that's just not your natural rhythm. Perhaps you need to experiment with working in shorter, more focused intervals, with regular breaks to recharge and reflect on your progress.

It's also interesting that you mention writing as an exception to this pattern. What is it about writing that feels different to you? Is it the creative freedom, the lack of technical hurdles, or something else entirely? Exploring what makes writing work for you might give us some clues about how to apply those same principles to your other projects.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to not be consistent all the time. It's a myth that creatives need to be constantly producing in order to be valid or successful. Maybe instead of beating yourself up over your lack of consistency, you could try practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's a normal part of the creative process. What do you think?","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That cycle of hyper-focus followed by a motivation crash is super common, especially with creative projects. It sounds less like incompetence and more like you're riding the wave of dopamine and then crashing when things get tough or less exciting.

Instead of focusing on grand schedules, maybe try micro-goals. Seriously tiny ones. Like, ""spend 5 minutes on 3D modeling"" or ""write one line of code."" The point isn't to achieve a lot in those 5 minutes, but to break the inertia and make it less daunting to start. Often, once you're in, you'll keep going.

Also, be kind to yourself about the roadblocks. Instead of seeing them as failures, view them as learning opportunities. When you hit one, schedule a specific time to research it, maybe 30 minutes. If you still can't figure it out, reach out for help online or from a friend. Knowing you have a plan to tackle the problem can reduce the anxiety that leads to procrastination.

Finally, consider that maybe you're spreading yourself too thin. Jumping between multiple projects might be fueling the burnout. Could you pick *one* project to focus on for a set period, even if it's just a month, and see if that helps you build consistency? Good luck, you got this!

t3_t9q6qm,"[need advice] For the last year or so, my attention span has dropped considerably. How do I fix it?","I've noticed that for a while now, I have really bad issues with focusing on something. I become bored, disinterested, or impatient with big things like studying, but also the small stuff which is where I noticed the pattern initially. For example, if I'm watching a video on how to do something or just a video where something is supposed to happen based on the title, I repeatedly try and skip to that part, often taking more time in doing so than the actual length of the video. I also haven't had as much interest in video games for more than an hour or so on top of the more serious things. I'm contemplating getting seen for ADHD but wanted to hear some advice and/or opinions. Thanks!","Begin to practice meditation. It has incredible effects on focus.


In the beginning you will mostly be focusing and then spiraling into thought. The practice is to notice this has happened, relax for a moment,, and then return to the object of focus (usually your breathing). The more you do this the less it will happen.","I had this problem too and fixed it. Here's what worked for me:

1. Don't consume any ""content"" before 6pm (no social media, no news, no YouTube, no video games, no TV, no audiobooks, no podcasts, no paper books, nothing). Use an app/website blocker like Freedom to support you.
2. Work in focused 25-50 minute periods with social support. I use Focusmate for that. During those focused work periods, only do one thing at at time.

The combination reset my attention span. I thought my brain was broken but now I can read difficult books for fun in the evenings.

The no content thing I had to work up to, and I still only do about 90% perfectly, but it works extremely well. Consume as much content as you want between 6pm and bedtime, but nothing before that.","It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue these days, and it's great that you're looking for ways to address it. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks**: When you're studying or working on something big, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help maintain your focus.

2. **Set Timers**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and focused.

3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those interruptions. This could mean putting your phone on silent or using apps that block distracting websites.

4. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can improve your attention span over time. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.

5. **Evaluate Your Environment**: Sometimes, a change in your study or work environment can help. Make sure your space is conducive to focus—good lighting, comfortable seating, and minimal noise can all contribute.

6. **Consider Professional Help**: If you suspect ADHD, it might be worth consulting a professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and suggest strategies or treatments that are tailored to your needs.

Remember, improving focus is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!","Getting checked for ADHD is definitely worth exploring, but there are also some practical steps you can take right now to help rebuild your attention span. Our modern world of infinite scrolling and instant gratification has really done a number on most people's ability to focus.

Start by creating designated ""deep focus"" periods - even just 15-20 minutes at first. During these times, put your phone in another room and use website blockers if needed. The key is removing the temptation to constantly switch tasks or seek immediate stimulation.

For videos specifically, try making yourself watch them straight through without skipping. It's like training a muscle - uncomfortable at first but gets easier with practice. You can also try taking notes while watching to stay actively engaged.

With gaming and other activities, set a timer for 30 minutes of focused play. When the timer goes off, take a quick break, then decide if you want to continue. This helps build back the ability to stick with one thing instead of constantly seeking novelty.

Reading physical books (not ebooks) can also help retrain your attention span. Start with just 10 minutes daily and gradually increase. The lack of hyperlinks and notifications makes it easier to maintain focus.

Remember that attention span is malleable - you can absolutely improve it with consistent practice. While getting evaluated for ADHD is a good idea, implementing these strategies can help regardless of the underlying cause.","It sounds like you're struggling with sustaining focus and attention, which can be really frustrating. Before exploring medical options, you might want to try a few strategies to see if you can improve your attention span on your own. One thing that could help is setting small, achievable goals for yourself when working on tasks or watching videos - this can make it feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each goal. Additionally, trying to eliminate distractions while you're focused on something might be helpful - turn off notifications, find a quiet space, etc. It's also possible that your brain is just used to the instant gratification of being able to skip around or switch between tasks quickly, so trying to practice patience and persistence could be beneficial. As for the video game thing, it's not uncommon for interests to wax and wane over time, but if you're finding that you're having trouble focusing on games as well, it might be worth exploring why that is - are you feeling bored with the types of games you're playing, or is it just hard to sit still for an extended period? Exploring these questions and trying out some new strategies might give you a better sense of what's going on and whether seeking medical attention is the right next step.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of your attention slipping away is super frustrating. It's good you're thinking about potential causes and seeking advice.

Before jumping to ADHD, which is definitely something to explore with a professional if you're concerned, let's look at some things you can try to build back your focus.

First, try the Pomodoro Technique. It's basically working in focused 25-minute bursts with short 5-minute breaks in between. It can help you trick your brain into staying engaged for those shorter periods, and then you can gradually increase the work intervals as you get better.

Second, think about your environment. Are you constantly bombarded with notifications or distractions? Try putting your phone on silent, closing unnecessary tabs, and finding a quiet space to work or study. Even just decluttering your desk can make a difference.

Third, for the video skipping thing, try actively engaging with the content. Take notes, pause and summarize what you've learned, or even try teaching it to someone else (even if it's just to your cat!). Active learning is way more engaging than passively watching.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Don't expect to go from zero to a hundred overnight. It's a process, and there will be days when you struggle. Just keep practicing, and you'll start to see improvement. And if you're still concerned after trying these things, definitely talk to a doctor or therapist about ADHD. Good luck!

Question your anxiety until it’s so exhausted it dies. I used to have anxiety about telling people no or disappointing people. I was so afraid of people not liking me… I interrogated myself until I just didn’t care if people liked me. I do this with every anxiety now.,"TLDR: Work on things that you can change and practice a ""it is what it is"" mindset for the things you can't

I've heard of a technique which I've been tryna practice. Soo  It's where you create a list of all the things/situations/etc that gives you anxiety and you group them up based on if you can do something about it or nah. After grouping, dedicate time and effort to things which you can change while learning to accept the things you can't.","Finding a balance between indulging in distractions and dealing with anxiety can be tough, but it's definitely possible with some small steps. Start by setting aside a short, dedicated time each day to be device-free. Use this time to engage in activities that are calming but still engaging, like reading a book, drawing, or going for a walk. This can help ease you into being comfortable with your thoughts without overwhelming anxiety. Also, consider practicing mindfulness or meditation for a few minutes daily. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and reduce anxiety over time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be patient with yourself as you work towards finding that middle ground.","What you're describing is actually a common challenge - the contrast between constant stimulation and sitting with our thoughts. The good news is that you can gradually build tolerance for both focused attention and managing anxiety.

Start by creating small pockets of device-free time, maybe 10-15 minutes at first. During these periods, try simple activities like taking a walk, doing a puzzle, or reading a physical book. These give your mind something concrete to focus on while stepping away from high-dopamine activities.

For managing anxious thoughts, consider starting a basic mindfulness practice. The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety but to observe thoughts without getting caught up in them. Even 5 minutes of focusing on your breathing can help build this skill.

You might also benefit from having a ""worry time"" - set aside 15 minutes daily to actively process your concerns. Write them down, consider solutions, then move on. When anxious thoughts pop up outside this time, remind yourself you'll address them during the designated period.

Remember that both extremes - constant stimulation and overwhelming anxiety - are learned responses that can be gradually adjusted. Take small steps, be patient with yourself, and celebrate progress along the way. Building a more balanced relationship with both stimulation and stillness takes time, but it's absolutely achievable.","It sounds like you're caught between two extremes, and finding a balance is key. One strategy could be to start small by setting aside device-free time in short intervals, like 10-15 minutes a day, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. During this time, try to focus on a single, calming activity, such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or a short walk. This can help your mind adjust to not relying on dopamine-inducing activities for comfort. Additionally, consider exploring stress management techniques, like mindfulness meditation or yoga, which can help you develop coping mechanisms for anxiety. It's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to take things at your own pace and not expect to overhaul your habits overnight. By taking tiny steps towards finding this middle ground, you can work on building resilience and developing a more mature mindset that can handle stress in a healthier way.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough when you feel stuck between instant gratification and overwhelming anxiety. It sounds like you're looking for a way to build resilience and find a healthier balance.

One thing that might help is to start small with facing those anxious thoughts. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Maybe dedicate just 5-10 minutes a day to sitting with your thoughts, without judgment. You could even try journaling – writing them down can sometimes take the edge off.

As for the dopamine hits, try replacing them gradually instead of cutting them out cold turkey. If you spend hours on social media, try reducing it by 15 minutes each day and replacing that time with something slightly more productive or relaxing, like reading or a short walk. The key is to make the alternative appealing enough that you don't feel like you're depriving yourself.

Building discipline is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small wins, and don't beat yourself up for slip-ups. They're part of the process. You got this!

t3_1279h7y,[need advice] I am so consumed with self loathing I can’t see myself doing any job.,"I am so consumed with a constant sense of self loathing and scared of rejection. I don’t feel capable of much of anything. 

I'm nowhere near as smart or witty as I wish I was. I lack a lot of knowledge that I should have by now. My personality fucking sucks… I’m introverted and have crippling social anxiety. I barely even talk to anyone and suck at being personable. My social skills suck. I’m not funny. I have ADHD and it makes it difficult to do so much.. I can’t multitask, I forget things all the time, I suck at time management and thinking quickly in social settings. If I’m anxious my processing slows down. If I'm feeling good about myself, a lot of this except for the ADHD symptoms melts away and I can have a personality. But I simply can't feel good about myself.

I’m looking for new jobs but I say no to everything. It would be cool to try being a multitude of different things but they all require you to be extroverted and have a good personality, like being a trivia host. I just couldn’t see myself fitting in as usual. 

My self esteem is so fucked I think I’m beyond repair. I keep comparing myself to other people and feel like I’ll never make it.","I feel your pain and I’m going through a pretty similar situation. I wish I had some advice, but all I can say hang in there and that you are not alone! I genuinely wish you the best of luck, navigating through life is quite the experience and at least for me I feel discouraged about it more times than not.","Sounds a little like how CPTSD affects a person. People who had loving, affirming, supportive caregivers usually don’t develop such a poor self image like you are describing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You may just have an unregulated nervous system and never properly learned how to ground yourself in your own body/experience. Maybe check out r/CPTSD?","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking for advice. That takes courage. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-esteem and social anxiety, and there are ways to work through it.

Start small. Pick one thing you want to improve and focus on that. For example, if it's social skills, try setting a goal to have a short conversation with someone each day, even if it's just a simple ""hello"" or ""how are you?"" It might feel awkward at first, but practice helps.

For ADHD, consider breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Use tools like timers or apps to help with time management. It can also be helpful to write things down to keep track of what you need to do.

Remember, it's okay to be introverted. You don't have to be the life of the party to be successful or happy. Embrace who you are and focus on your strengths. Maybe look for jobs that align with your interests and where being introverted is an asset.

Lastly, try to be kinder to yourself. Everyone has their own journey, and comparing yourself to others can be a trap. Celebrate small victories and progress, no matter how minor they seem. You've got this!","Hey there. The way you're feeling right now is rough, but it's not permanent and it's not beyond repair. Let's break this down into manageable pieces.

First, having ADHD means your brain works differently - not worse, just different. Many successful people have ADHD and have found ways to work with it rather than against it. Instead of trying to force yourself to be good at multitasking, lean into your ability to hyperfocus. Find roles that let you tackle one thing at a time.

Start small. Really small. Pick one tiny skill you'd like to improve and practice it for just 5 minutes a day. Maybe it's making small talk with the grocery store cashier, or reading about a topic that interests you. The goal isn't to become an expert - it's just to prove to yourself that you can grow.

For job hunting, try looking for positions that play to your strengths rather than forcing yourself into roles that drain you. Introverts can excel in many careers - data analysis, writing, programming, research, skilled trades - where the focus is on your work rather than constant social interaction. 

Stop comparing yourself to others - they're running a different race with different starting points. Instead, compare yourself to where you were yesterday. Even tiny improvements count.

The fact that you feel better when you're confident shows that your personality isn't the problem - your self-talk is. Work on building small wins that you can look back on. Keep a ""wins journal"" where you write down one thing you did well each day, no matter how small.

You've already shown courage by reaching out for advice. That's a win right there. Build on that momentum, one tiny step at a time.","It sounds like you're really struggling with some tough feelings about yourself, and it's making it hard for you to see a path forward in your career. One thing that might be helpful is to try to separate your self-worth from your job prospects. Instead of thinking ""I'm not good enough to do this job,"" try to focus on what specific skills or tasks you're interested in and see if there are any jobs that align with those. You don't have to be the most outgoing or charismatic person to succeed - many jobs value quiet, detail-oriented workers, for example. 

It might also be helpful to start small and build up your confidence gradually. Instead of looking at big, intimidating jobs like being a trivia host, what are some smaller steps you could take to get more experience and build your skills? Could you try volunteering or taking on a part-time job in a low-stakes environment? This could help you get a feel for what you're capable of and start to build up your self-esteem. 

Lastly, it's worth remembering that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparing yourself to others is often not very helpful. Instead of focusing on what you think you're lacking, try to focus on what you do bring to the table - your unique perspective, skills, and experiences. And don't forget that ADHD is a legitimate condition that can affect people's lives in many ways - it's not something to be ashamed of, and there are many successful people with ADHD who have learned to work with their strengths and challenges.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not beyond repair. A lot of what you're describing is a cycle, and discipline can be a tool to break it.

First, about the job thing: instead of focusing on dream jobs that feel impossible right now, what about aiming for something small and manageable? Think about skills you *want* to develop, not just what you think you're already good at (or not good at). Even a part-time gig where you interact with a few people could be a starting point. The goal isn't to be perfect, it's to get some experience and build confidence.

Regarding the self-loathing, that's a bigger beast, but discipline can help there too. Start small. Really small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire personality, pick ONE tiny thing you want to improve. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. The key is consistency. When you start proving to yourself that you *can* stick to something, even something small, it builds momentum.

Also, comparison is the thief of joy. Seriously. Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger those feelings. Focus on your own progress, not someone else's highlight reel.

Finally, for the ADHD stuff, have you explored strategies specifically for managing it? There are tons of resources out there, from apps to organizational techniques. Finding what works for you can make a huge difference in managing time and focus.

It's not going to be an overnight fix, but small, consistent steps can lead to big changes. Be kind to yourself, celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward. You got this.

t3_113mdus,"[Need Advice] I (17m) have the most important examination of my life in just a few weeks, but I can't get myself motivated to study.","Any help would be greatly appreciated in how I can get on track. I was able to study for over 7 hours a day just a few months back, but now I've last all focus and determination. Any methods, plans or adive will help.","Firstly, I would start by saying, your first problem is thinking that you need motivation. Yeah, you heard me right. The greatest mirage society has ever created is that notion that “you need to feel motivated to be able to accomplish something”; this right here messed me up through out secondary school, I repeatedly kept failing classes all because I was too busy worrying that I couldn’t read unless I was motivated. Here’s where discipline comes in; doing it not because you FEEL like but because your growth as an individual DEPENDS on it ( this doesn’t apply only to academics).

     I know all these might sound like a cliché but I’m honestly speaking from experience. I’m currently in my 1st year law major(18m) in my undergraduate University , 1st semester was hell on earth for me. However, what helped me was that I started looking into what my problems actually were, because after I read a book called “atomic habits”, it helped me understand myself better. One good point it made was this “our minds are pre-conditioned to avoid anything that stresses us”, and it deals with these through procrastination that usually comes out as lack of motivation. 

After identifying these problems, I  now had to ask myself “why does studying stress me out”? I did some research and it turned out that I had a terrible reading habit of regression and fixation; They are conscious acts of re-reading sentences and reading one word at a time, which impairs reading comprehension and efficiency. After this discovery, I worked hard to find a solution to them.  Over the months, I have consistently improved on them. Saying that by addressing these problems helped boost my academic performance would be an understatement in all honesty, because I went from procrastinating on a 12page weekly reading  to handling 70+ page weekly readings, and I ended up getting straight A’s in my previous semester, thanks to way I addressed these problems.

 
Lastly doing all these was extremely heart wrenching for me and incredibly frustrating as well. There were  many points in time where I wanted to give up, but I continued, not because I was motivated to but because I had to. 

P.S : Hope this helps, and good luck with your exams!","Take deep breaths.  Stay hydrated. Build momentum. 

Whenever you feel off track build momentum. 

Start walking and pacing in your room.  Then pick up a book and start turning pages.  Then start at first page and read one line.  Repeat. This is the hard part.  Repeat this until it gets less hard. 

Then two paragraphs.  Read em all again and again.  Repeat for another two paragraphs.  Until two paragraphs become easy to read.  Now build like this.  Blocks and chunks of paragraphs. 

Repeat and repeat.  Whenever you feel like you can't do the reading walk and pace.  Be in motion.  Make yourself believe that you are in a state of flow","Hey there! It's totally normal to hit a slump, especially when the pressure is on. Here are a few tips that might help you get back on track:

1. **Break it Down**: Instead of thinking about studying for hours, break your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Try the Pomodoro Technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help maintain focus.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve in each study session. Having specific goals can give you a sense of direction and accomplishment.

3. **Create a Routine**: Try to study at the same time every day. This can help train your brain to get into ""study mode"" more easily.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Find a quiet place to study and keep your phone and other distractions away. If you need your phone for study apps, consider using apps that block social media during study times.

5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can boost your mood and energy levels. Even a short walk or some stretching can help clear your mind.

6. **Remember Your Why**: Remind yourself why this exam is important to you. Keeping your long-term goals in mind can help reignite your motivation.

You've got this! Just take it one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself. Good luck!","Hey there - I totally get the pre-exam motivation slump. It's actually pretty common, especially when the stakes feel high. The good news is you've already proven you can study effectively (7 hours a day is impressive!), so we know you've got it in you.

Here's what tends to work well in these situations: Start by breaking your study sessions into smaller chunks, like 25-30 minutes, with short breaks in between. This makes getting started feel way less daunting than thinking about hours of studying. Set a timer and just commit to that first chunk - often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you're in the flow.

Create a simple study schedule for the next few weeks. Map out specific topics for each day rather than vague ""study time."" Having clear, bite-sized goals makes it easier to track progress and stay motivated.

Also, your study environment matters a lot. Find a spot that's just for studying - could be a library, a specific desk, whatever works. When you're there, you're in study mode. Period.

Remember, motivation comes and goes - that's normal. The key is building a routine that doesn't rely on feeling motivated. Start small today, maybe just an hour of focused study, and gradually build back up. You've done this before, and you can absolutely do it again.","It's normal to feel unmotivated, especially when the stakes are high. One thing that might help is to break down your studying into smaller, manageable chunks, rather than feeling like you need to study for 7 hours straight. Try setting a timer for 25 minutes, studying intensely during that time, and then taking a 5-minute break. This technique is called the Pomodoro Method, and it can make studying feel less overwhelming. Additionally, try to identify what specifically is causing your lack of motivation - is it fear of failure, burnout, or something else? Once you understand the root cause, you can start working on strategies to address it. For example, if you're feeling burned out, maybe take a day off to relax and recharge before getting back into your study routine. Remember, it's not about studying for 7 hours a day, but about making consistent progress towards your goal. You've done it before, so you can do it again - just take it one step at a time.","Hey, that sounds rough, especially with such a big exam coming up. It's totally normal to have motivation dips, even after periods of intense focus. Don't beat yourself up about it.

First, try breaking down your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of aiming for 7 hours straight, try 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with 5-minute breaks. It's easier to commit to 25 minutes than a whole day.

Second, think about *why* you were motivated before. What was different a few months ago? Were you studying with friends? Did you have a clear reward system? Try to recreate those conditions. Maybe find a study buddy, even if it's just virtually.

Third, and this is key: focus on *starting*, not finishing. Tell yourself you'll just study for 10 minutes. Often, once you get going, you'll find it easier to keep going. The hardest part is usually just overcoming that initial inertia.

Finally, make sure you're taking care of yourself. Are you sleeping enough? Eating well? Getting some exercise? Burnout is real, and it kills motivation. Even a short walk can do wonders. Good luck, you got this!

t3_zlep1q,[Need Advice] I hate feeling this way,"I am a 24 year old male who has aspirations of becoming a doctor. I once considered myself a hard worker and overall a good student (Found myself rarely procrastinating outside of a handful of situations). However, everything changed around the 5th and final year of my college degree when the pandemic hit. I found myself not caring for anything and having trouble getting the motivation to study as all the exams were open book and not really stimulating. I finally graduate from college and for the past year I have been preparing to take the mcat. However, for almost a year now I found myself not really studying or even putting in much effort in anything at all. I would study maybe 1-2 hours in the morning every day and get distracted/feel unmotivated (because of the difficulty) to continue until it's 1 pm and it's time to go to work. I took my MCAT back in September and got the results in October, and I bombed it pretty bad. I have no excuses as to why except that I was lazy and didn't give it a good effort. So I schedule my exam for January 27th of next year, made a schedule and commit and attempt to really put in effort. All of November was completely fine and my motivation was good, but I found myself slowly but surely getting less and less motivated and less and less disciplined. I am not afraid of failure, but I hate this feeling of failing myself and I am honestly so sick an tired of it. I planned on rescheduling my exam to march and honestly want change for the better. I want to go back to how I once was, but I need help and would appreciate any advice (don't sugar coat anything because I think I really need to hear it).","No sugarcoating? Aight fam. 

Being a doctor is way more stressful than sticking to a study routine for a couple months. Yeah, the pressure is unreal for the MCAT - but nothing compared to the pressure you may feel depending on what type of doctor you become, or the pressure to keep money coming into the hospital so they keep you, or the pressure to balance your insanely demanding career with the needs of your family. You need to develop an acquired taste for pressure, my dude, or you’re going to be miserable. 

You slippin’ cause you’re at the homestretch and your mind has already considered it a given? Happens to the best of us. Few things are more powerful wake up calls than investing a shit ton of time/energy into something and it slipping away when it was almost within reach. You’re in the danger zone; **focus**. Senioritis is real, but you’re not at the end of anything dude, you’re barely at the beginning. Residency is going to *wear you out* for starters. 

On the flip side, evaluate your well-being to make sure you’re firing on all cylinders - something may need addressing. Physically - get enough sleep, eat well and get your vitamins (why am I listing this out you’re a med student, you know the drill). Emotionally/mentally, are you running from something? Did the lockdowns shift your perspective? *what changed?* It may not simply come down to a lack of momentum that you’re having a hard time restarting - figure this part out. You’ll want it resolved before residency. 

The path you’re going down requires more than people anticipate - all look at the benefits, glaze over the costs. Make sure you’re prepared to pay the cost, and if so, dig deep to reignite the drive (yeah, it’s gonna hurt and you’re gonna have to go out of your comfort zone so prepare for that). 

Best of luck.",,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's totally normal to feel a bit lost after such a big shift in your routine and motivation. Here are a few things you might find helpful:

1. **Break it Down**: Instead of thinking about the entire MCAT prep as one big task, break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Focus on one topic or section at a time. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

2. **Set a Routine**: Try to establish a consistent daily routine. Even if it's just a couple of hours of focused study time, having a set schedule can help build discipline. Make sure to include breaks to avoid burnout.

3. **Find Your Why**: Reconnect with your initial motivation for wanting to become a doctor. Sometimes reminding yourself of the bigger picture can reignite your passion and drive.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what typically distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This could mean studying in a different environment, using apps to block distracting websites, or setting specific times to check your phone.

5. **Accountability**: Consider finding a study buddy or joining a study group. Having someone to check in with can keep you accountable and motivated.

6. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, it's okay to have off days. What's important is getting back on track and not being too hard on yourself. Progress is progress, no matter how small.

You've got this! Just take it one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. Good luck with your studies and your upcoming exam!","Hey there - what you're describing is actually a pretty common experience, especially for those who went through the pandemic during their studies. That shift from being a disciplined student to feeling unmotivated isn't permanent though.

The key thing to understand is that motivation is unreliable - it comes and goes. What you need to focus on is building systems and habits that work even when motivation isn't there. Start by breaking down your MCAT prep into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to study all day,"" set specific goals like ""I will complete 2 practice sections and review my mistakes.""

Since you mentioned you're most productive in the morning, lean into that. Create a solid morning routine that automatically leads into study time. No decisions needed - just follow the routine. Put your phone in another room during study blocks and use a timer. Work in focused 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro technique).

Most importantly, track your progress daily. Use a simple spreadsheet or habit tracker to log your study hours and practice test scores. This creates accountability and helps you see improvement over time, which builds momentum.

The March timeline sounds more realistic. Use this extra time to gradually build back your study stamina. Start with 3 solid hours of focused study per day and increase by 30 minutes each week. Quality matters more than quantity - better to have 4 hours of focused work than 8 hours of distracted ""studying.""

Remember, discipline isn't about feeling motivated or even enjoying the work. It's about showing up and doing what needs to be done, regardless of how you feel. You've done it before, and you can absolutely do it again.","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of burnout, lack of motivation, and disappointment in yourself, which is understandable given the significant changes you've faced since the pandemic. First, acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay, and it's great that you're recognizing the need for change. To get back on track, I'd suggest taking a closer look at your study routine and environment. You mentioned studying 1-2 hours in the morning, but getting distracted easily - try breaking your study sessions into smaller, focused chunks with scheduled breaks to help maintain concentration. Additionally, identify the specific difficulties you're facing with the MCAT material and tackle those areas head-on, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the exam as a whole. It might also be helpful to find a study group or accountability partner to provide an added motivation boost. As for rescheduling your exam, it might not be a bad idea to take a step back and reassess your goals, but make sure you're not using it as a way to procrastinate further. You've already shown that you can be a hard worker and good student, so it's time to tap back into that mindset. Be kind to yourself, but also be honest - what are the smallest, most achievable changes you can make today to start building momentum towards your goals?","Hey, I get where you're coming from. That post-college slump is real, especially after the pandemic threw everything off. It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of wanting to study, starting, then losing steam.

First, be honest with yourself about your study schedule. Is it realistic? Cramming everything into the morning might not be the best approach. Maybe try breaking it up into smaller chunks throughout the day, even if it's just 30 minutes here and there. Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to make it less daunting.

Second, figure out what's killing your motivation. Is it the material itself? If so, try different study methods. Instead of just reading, try practice questions, teaching the material to someone (even a rubber duck!), or using flashcards. If it's the environment, find a new study spot – library, coffee shop, even a different room in your house.

Third, don't beat yourself up about the past. The MCAT is a beast, and plenty of people don't nail it the first time. Use that score as data, not a judgment. Analyze your weaknesses and focus your studying there.

Finally, remember why you want to be a doctor. Write it down, put it somewhere you'll see it every day. When you're feeling unmotivated, remind yourself of that bigger picture. And don't be afraid to take breaks! Burnout is real, and a little self-care can go a long way. Good luck, you got this!

t3_uv3h7l,[Need advice] Failed out of college a year ago. Can’t figure out a plan and feel like an absolute wastoid.,"I rarely use Reddit so not sure if this is the best place to share my ramblings but hopefully someone can offer some advice it would be much appreciated. This will probably be a long one.

A year ago I was academically dismissed from college. I was in my 4th year and botched 2 semesters in a row. When COVID started everything went online and from that point I gradually started to lose all motivation to even touch my laptop. Got to a point where I just gave up on all of my classes and stopped doing anything for months. 

I just sat in my apartment and watched paint dry until the year was over, my lease was done and the letter came that said I was dismissed. I came back home to live at my Moms house and have been working my part time grocery store job that I’ve been at since high school. 

I’ve never been a great student but I wouldn’t say I was overall horrible either. I was always a B student but sometimes I could pull of an A if I really tried. When online school hit I quickly felt like I wasn’t capable of doing the work anymore. The college workload became annoying to me and I just got sick of doing the assignments. 

I don’t know how to convince myself the work isn’t stupid. It felt like most of the assignments I had to do were pointless, tedious busy work that didn’t really give me any skills or help improve anything for me to benefit. College felt more like it’s just pretentious professors that love hearing themselves talk more than anything else. I lost the will power to get things done even when annoyed by the college routine. So I failed. And the major of all things is media production. 

Not the most difficult thing you would think of. Which adds to the guilt and the feelings I have that make me think I’m a failure and that I’ve wasted a good opportunity. But I wasn’t really THAT interested in the major. It just seemed like the only one I could tolerate. 

I genuinely have no idea what I’m supposed to do with my life and I never have. I just chose media production because I thought, “video editing doesn’t sound too bad.” That’s all the thought that went into that decision. I’m not sure why some people believe that everyone has a passion buried inside of them but I have never been able to figure that out. I’m skating through life and literally feel worthless. 

I have no skills. I have nothing to show for myself. I somehow just lived for 22 years and now I have to figure out what to do with my life. Therapy isn’t bad, but I didn’t feel like it made any of this more clear. They just ask the same questions as everyone else. 

“What do you like to do?” 
Idk man that’s literally why I’m here I have no idea what I like to do I haven’t done shit my whole life. I’m currently miserable the only thing I like is not working all day like a rat. 

I don’t know if I’d even be able to go back to school or if I want to. I feel powerless because nothing entices me enough to bite the bullet and jump through hoops to accomplish something. I don’t know what I’m capable of. I envy people with a plan. I wish I had one. This whole year I’ve been trying to think of SOMETHING to do and I am no closer to figuring it out than I was a year ago. 

I know I sound like a bitter, irresponsible idiot, because I think I am one. I’m ashamed of wasting time doing absolutely nothing, but I’m not going to pick some random shit out of a hat on a whim because I will probably end up wasting even more time being miserable doing that.

“Just try shit” doesn’t resonate with me. It’s such a vague thing to say. Try what? I’m not doing a trade wasting my life fixing furnaces in someone’s filthy ass basement for semi decent money. I have friends that do HVAC and I would rather jump into a volcano.

I know how to use Adobe premier(but I’m in no way great at it) and probably wouldn’t hate video production as a career, I just hate school. The hoop jumping is what gets me. 99% of what I learned about editing came from YouTube. And at least half of the classes that cost thousands of dollars to take have nothing to do with shooting video or editing. This definitely factored into why I stopped trying in school. 

There’s so much more I could say but Reddit mobile gets so laggy after the first few paragraphs so I’ll end it here. Thanks to anyone who took time out of their day to read this it feels good to write this out even though I’m clueless of what to do.

Edit: Also I don’t want this to come off like a sob story or that I’m trying to make people feel bad for me or anything like that. I’m fully aware that I’m still blessed for having a mother who’s willing to put up with my dumbass living in her house while I have an existential crisis. I know there are so many people out there that have it so much worse than I do and that I eventually will straighten this shit out. I really appreciate everyone’s comments it means the world to me.","Have you been tested for ADHD?

Edit: not meaning for that to sound rude. It’s just that your aimlessness sounds a lot like executive dysfunction. 

ADHD brains don’t make dopamine the way typical brains do. Most people can get up and do something just because they’re supposed to, and when they do it, it actually *feels good.* Their brains release that dopamine hit and they feel accomplished. 

ADHD brains.. they don’t do that. So it’s extremely hard for some people to do.. anything. Because there is literally no Feel Good Reward after they do it. So sometimes it’s hard to find anything to be interested in at all. 

Anyway. Just a thought. Might help to rule it out if you haven’t already.",,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and trying to figure things out. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but remember, it's okay to feel lost sometimes. A lot of people go through similar phases, especially after big changes like leaving college.

One thing that might help is to start small and build from there. You mentioned you know how to use Adobe Premiere and don't hate video production. Why not explore that a bit more? You could start by working on small projects or even freelance gigs. Websites like Upwork or Fiverr can be good places to find short-term projects that let you practice and improve your skills without the pressure of a full-time job or school.

Also, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself. It could be as simple as learning a new editing technique each week or completing a short video project. This can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment.

As for finding what you like, try to think about what activities make you lose track of time or what you find yourself naturally drawn to. It doesn't have to be a grand passion, just something that sparks a bit of interest. And remember, it's perfectly fine to not have everything figured out right now. Life is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep exploring and be kind to yourself along the way. You've got this!","Hey there - your situation is actually more common than you might think, especially after COVID threw everything sideways. The good news is you've already identified some key things: you know video editing isn't terrible for you, you've learned effectively through YouTube, and you're self-aware enough to know what you don't want (like HVAC work).

Instead of trying to figure out your entire life path right now, why not start with what's directly in front of you? You've got Premier skills - even if they're not expert level yet. The cool thing about video editing is you can build a portfolio without needing anyone's permission or formal education. 

Here's what I suggest: Start a 30-day challenge. Pick one type of video content you think you could tolerate making (maybe local business ads, YouTube intros, wedding highlights, whatever) and make one short video every day. They don't need to be masterpieces - the goal is to build the habit of creating consistently. Use free stock footage if you need to.

By the end of the month, you'll have 30 pieces for a portfolio, a better sense of whether you actually enjoy this work, and most importantly, you'll have broken out of the paralysis of doing nothing. Plus, you might discover a specific niche you enjoy more than others.

The discipline part isn't about forcing yourself to love something - it's about showing up every day to do the work, even when it feels pointless. Start small, but start somewhere. You don't need to commit to a lifetime career path right now - you just need to take the first step.

If after 30 days you hate it, fine - at least you'll know for sure, and you can try something else. But you might surprise yourself with what you can accomplish when you focus on small, daily progress instead of trying to solve everything at once.","It takes a lot of courage to share your story, and I'm glad you did. First, let's acknowledge that feeling lost and uncertain about your future is completely normal, especially after a significant setback like failing out of college. It's great that you're recognizing your strengths, such as your experience with Adobe Premiere, and that you have a support system in place, like your mom.

Rather than trying to find a passion or a career path right away, maybe focus on building small, achievable habits that can help you regain momentum. For example, you could start by dedicating a few hours each week to learning new skills or working on personal projects that interest you, even if it's just editing videos for fun. This can help you build confidence and a sense of purpose.

It's also important to recognize that your experience with online school and feeling disconnected from the coursework is not uncommon. Many people struggle with the traditional education system, and it doesn't mean you're not capable or intelligent. You've already demonstrated that you can learn through YouTube tutorials, so maybe explore other alternative learning paths that work better for you.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about not having a plan yet. It's okay to take your time and figure things out gradually. You're 22, and many people change careers or paths multiple times throughout their lives. What's important is that you're taking small steps towards self-reflection and seeking help when you need it. Keep exploring, learning, and taking care of yourself, and you'll increase your chances of finding a path that works for you.","Hey, thanks for sharing all of that. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but also that you're aware of it and want to make a change, which is the first big step.

It's totally understandable to feel lost after a setback like that, especially when you're questioning your path. The ""just try shit"" advice is annoying because it's so broad. Let's try to make it more specific.

Since you mentioned you don't hate video production and already know some Premiere, maybe focus there. But instead of thinking about a whole career, think about a small project. Could you offer to edit videos for a local business's social media for free, just to build a portfolio? Or create a short film with some friends? The key is to make it something manageable and not tied to the pressure of school.

As for the motivation piece, maybe you're waiting for passion to strike, but sometimes passion comes *after* you get good at something. So, instead of searching for a passion, try committing to a small, achievable goal related to video editing. Maybe it's learning a new technique each week or completing one small project a month.

Also, don't discount your grocery store job. Customer service, time management, teamwork – those are all skills. Think about how you can highlight those on a resume.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're 22, not 52. You've got time to figure things out. Focus on small, actionable steps, and celebrate those wins. Good luck!

t3_zm4r0t,[need advice] I feel like I am going back to my old habits,"So I'm(19F)  a young student and I was living alone but due to complicated reasons I had to go back to my parents house. I realised that when i was alone, i was way more disciplined and i used to bring a lot of value to time. I was working out 4x a week, I had a plan and a vision , I had a pretty good meal plan, I was healthy... 

Now that i'm living again with my parents and my 2 brothers i feel like i'm losing myself again. I act like when i had an ED. My screen time is enormous. I'm losing my ideas , my goals... I respect my parents but the energy of this house is so low...(people are shouting, complaining, eating bad)

How can I change my environment ? I sincerely do not want to go back to my old habits. It scares me. 

Thank you.","It's not easy being the only motivated and disciplined person in your environment. You have to be better than who your around. It's takes dedication. Spend more time out of the house around their negative energy. It will consume you and drag yours down with it. 

You don't have to fall back into it just because you're around them. BE exactly who you are even if no one likes it. You don't want to go back then don't. Only you can decide whether you go back. 

Your willpower and values have to be stronger than theirs. Set smalls goals first and work your way up. Easiest way to change your environment is to simply just change it. Get out, be anywhere else but there.  Hope this helps 

Good luck","Probably the best advice here. Find environments outside your home to do your work, maybe a library or some place at school","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough transition, but it's great that you're aware of the changes and want to take action. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Create a Personal Space**: Even if it's just a corner of your room, make a space that's yours where you can focus and feel motivated. Fill it with things that inspire you, like a vision board or your workout gear.

2. **Set Boundaries**: Communicate with your family about your need for some quiet time or specific hours when you need to focus. It might be tough, but setting these boundaries can help you maintain your routine.

3. **Stick to a Routine**: Try to keep the same habits you had when you were living alone. Set specific times for workouts, meals, and study sessions. Consistency can help you regain that sense of discipline.

4. **Limit Screen Time**: Set specific times for using your phone or computer for leisure. You can use apps to help limit your screen time if you find it hard to do on your own.

5. **Find Support**: If possible, connect with friends or a community that shares your goals. Having people to talk to who understand your journey can be really motivating.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. What's important is that you're trying to get back on track. You've done it before, and you can do it again! Good luck!","Living with family again can definitely shake up the routines you built while independent. The good news is you already know what works for you - the workout schedule, meal planning, and clear vision. Those habits aren't gone, they just need to be adapted to your new environment.

Since you can't control the overall house energy, focus on creating your own space and schedule. Try to maintain your workout routine by either going to a gym or finding a quiet spot in/around the house for home workouts. For meals, you could meal prep your own healthy options separately or offer to cook some healthier meals for the family occasionally.

To minimize screen time and stay focused, consider spending time in your local library or finding a quiet coffee shop where you can work on your goals without the household distractions. Even a nearby park can be a great place to reset and plan.

The key is to treat your room or designated spaces as your ""apartment within the house"" - a place where you can maintain your positive habits. Set boundaries around your personal time and space while still being respectful of family dynamics. You might even find that your dedication to healthy habits gradually influences others in a positive way.

Remember - you developed those good habits once, and you can absolutely maintain them in this new situation. It just takes some creative adjusting and staying committed to your vision.","It's tough to adjust to a new environment, especially when it feels like it's pulling you away from your goals and healthy habits. One thing that might help is to create a dedicated space for yourself within your parents' house where you can focus on your own things without distractions. This could be a corner of your room or even just a specific chair where you can sit and work out your plans and vision without being disturbed.

Another strategy could be to establish a daily routine that you stick to, regardless of what's going on around you. So, even if the rest of the household is eating unhealthy food, you could still prepare your own meals according to your meal plan. And instead of trying to change the entire household's energy, focus on what you can control - your own actions and reactions. You might also consider finding ways to get out of the house regularly, whether that's going for a walk, meeting up with friends, or hitting the gym, to give yourself a break from the environment and stay connected to your goals.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time and not expect to have everything figured out right away. You've already shown that you're capable of creating positive habits and achieving your goals when you were living alone, so try to tap back into that mindset and see what works for you in this new situation. Lastly, consider having an open conversation with your parents about how you're feeling - they might be more understanding than you think, and it could lead to some positive changes in the household.","Hey, it's totally understandable that moving back home can throw off your routine, especially when the environment is different. It sounds like you built some awesome habits while living alone, so don't beat yourself up too much about slipping a bit.

First, try to carve out specific times for your workouts and meal prep, even if it's just 30 minutes here and there. Treat them like non-negotiable appointments. Maybe even put them on a shared family calendar (if you have one) so everyone knows when you need your space.

For the screen time, try setting timers or using apps that limit your usage. Replace that time with something you enjoy that doesn't involve a screen – reading, journaling, even just going for a walk.

As for the overall environment, it's tough to change other people's habits, but you *can* control your own reactions. Maybe suggest a family activity that's a little healthier, like a walk after dinner, but don't push it. Focus on creating your own little bubble of positivity and productivity. Noise-canceling headphones can be a lifesaver!

Most importantly, remember why you wanted to build those healthy habits in the first place. Keep your vision in mind, and don't let temporary setbacks derail you completely. You've done it before, you can do it again!

t3_x57vy7,[Need advice] How to find motivation for working again? After 3 years,"In my previous job, where i worked 8 years, i saved a ton of cash. I quit around 3 years ago cuz my boss was a massive A hole and the company was quite disorganized. Problem is i haven’t had a job now in 3 years. I’ve been living off savings and am slowly depleting it. But i just can’t find any real internal motivation to work anymore, although i will run out of money eventually. How on earth do i get out of this damn rut?? I have an opportunity recently to get back into the field i was in before but i’m just so blah blah and unmotivated about it all :(",I think you must have some sort of motivation because youve already started the process by coming here and getting some answers. Could you try part time work first and ease into it?,Very much in the same boat and would be interested in hearing any advice that comes the OP's way.,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Getting back into the workforce after a long break can be daunting, especially if you're not feeling motivated. One approach is to start small and build momentum. Set a daily routine that includes a few hours dedicated to job-related activities, like updating your resume, networking, or even just reading about industry trends. This can help ease you back into a work mindset without overwhelming you. Also, try to reconnect with what you enjoyed about your previous work or explore new areas within your field that might spark interest. Sometimes, motivation follows action, so taking those first steps can help reignite your drive. Remember, it's okay to feel blah about it at first—just keep moving forward, and the motivation will often catch up. Good luck!","First off - you're not alone in feeling this way after leaving a toxic work environment. That kind of experience can really impact how we view work altogether. But here's the thing: motivation is unreliable, and waiting for it to show up isn't the answer. What you need is to rebuild your work muscles through small, consistent actions.

Start by setting a structured daily schedule, even while unemployed. Wake up at the same time, get dressed, and treat job searching or skill development as your current ""job."" Even 2-3 hours a day of focused effort is better than nothing.

Since you have an opportunity in your previous field, use that as your starting point. The familiar territory means you already have valuable experience and skills. Consider starting part-time if possible - it can help ease the transition back into working life without feeling overwhelming.

Remember that work isn't just about money - it provides structure, purpose, and social connections. Your savings won't last forever, and it's much better to return to work while you still have that financial cushion rather than waiting until you're forced to take any job out of desperation.

Take that opportunity. The first few weeks will feel tough, but showing up consistently will rebuild your work ethic and confidence. Don't wait for motivation - let discipline and routine guide you back.","It's great that you're recognizing the need to get back to work before your savings run out. One thing that might help is to break down your motivations into smaller, more manageable parts. Instead of trying to find motivation for working in general, think about what specifically is holding you back from taking this new opportunity. Is it fear of going back to a similar work environment, or is it something else? Identifying the root of your resistance might help you address it directly. Additionally, you could try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like updating your resume or attending a networking event, to get yourself moving in the right direction. It's also worth considering what aspects of your previous job you enjoyed, and whether this new opportunity aligns with those interests. Sometimes, having something to look forward to can make getting started easier. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and you don't have to have all the motivation in the world to get started - just enough to take that first step.","Hey, that sounds like a tough spot to be in. It's understandable to feel unmotivated after a long break, especially after a bad experience.

First, don't beat yourself up too much. Three years is a while, but it doesn't define you. The fact that you're even thinking about getting back to work shows you're not completely checked out.

Instead of focusing on ""motivation,"" try thinking about small, actionable steps. Motivation often comes *after* you start doing something, not before.

Here's a thought: Instead of jumping straight back into a full-time job, could you explore some low-pressure options? Maybe some freelance work in your field, or even just a few hours a week consulting? This could help you ease back in and regain some momentum without the overwhelming feeling of a full commitment.

Also, think about *why* you want to work again, beyond just the money. What are your values? Does working give you a sense of purpose, accomplishment, or social connection? Connecting with those values can be a powerful motivator.

Finally, consider breaking down the job search process into tiny, manageable tasks. Today, maybe just update your resume. Tomorrow, browse job boards for 15 minutes. The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Good luck, you got this!

t3_t2pmhu,[Need advice] My disciplined life becomes chaotic during weekends. How to avoid it?,"I have a 9-5 job and I am disciplined during my weekdays. I always think about completely my pending and important tasks during the weekends. However, when weekends actually arrive, I tend to lose my daily routine. I watch porn a lot till late night on Friday and wakeup late the next Saturday. I also tend to sleep on my bed the weekends without doing my chores. I feel I tend to be more productive during my weekdays even though I have less time compared to my weekends. Hanging out with friends to late night during the weekends is also another reason why my sleep cycle is disturbed.","One thing you might experiment with is taking one day completely off to rest, and the other day schedule something for 9 or 10am outside of the house, like a breakfast with a friend, so you have to get up and get ready for the day. This will also motivate you to not stay up too late the night before.","Why not put 'hang out with friends' and 'watch porn' on your schedule? The time spent doing those things is obviously pleasurable to you, otherwise you wouldn't do them. If those activities in some way contribute to helping you recharge from your week, why not see them as valuable? Then you are removing the feeling that that time is 'wasted'. Your life isn't lacking discipline at the weekend, it's just that you do different things at the weekend and haven't accounted for them in your schedule.","Weekends can definitely throw off your routine, but there are a few strategies you might find helpful. First, try setting a loose schedule for your weekends, similar to your weekdays, but with more flexibility. This can help you maintain some structure without feeling too restricted. Consider setting a specific wake-up time and a few key tasks you want to accomplish each day. 

Also, think about setting limits on activities that tend to derail your plans, like watching porn or staying out late. You could try setting a timer or using apps that help limit screen time. For social activities, maybe plan them earlier in the day or set a time to head home so you can still get a good night's sleep.

Lastly, it might help to identify one or two things you really want to achieve over the weekend and focus on those. This way, you can still enjoy your downtime but also feel productive. Remember, it's all about balance and finding what works best for you. Good luck!","It's totally normal for discipline to slip on weekends - the lack of external structure can make it challenging. The key is creating your own weekend routine that's both productive and enjoyable, rather than falling into a cycle of late nights and oversleeping.

Start by setting a consistent weekend wake-up time that's reasonable - maybe 1-2 hours later than your weekday time. This helps maintain your circadian rhythm while still giving you some extra rest. Having a fixed wake-up time, even after going out with friends, will naturally encourage you to wrap up nights earlier.

For the porn habit, try replacing that Friday night routine with something else enjoyable but less disruptive to your sleep - maybe watching a movie, reading, or doing a hobby you enjoy. The goal isn't to make weekends as rigid as weekdays, but to find a middle ground.

Consider scheduling your most important weekend tasks for Saturday morning when you typically have more energy. Even just 2-3 hours of focused work then leaves you plenty of time for relaxation and socializing later. You might find it helpful to make a short list on Friday afternoon of 2-3 priority tasks for the weekend.

Remember that discipline isn't about being productive 24/7. It's okay to relax and have fun on weekends - the goal is finding a sustainable balance that leaves you feeling good rather than regretful come Monday morning.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common phenomenon - the weekend slump. One strategy that might help is to set some clear boundaries and goals for your weekends, just as you do for your weekdays. This could be as simple as deciding on a few non-negotiable tasks you want to complete, like doing your chores or tackling one important project, and scheduling them into your weekend plan. 

It's also worth considering why you feel the need to unwind in ways that derail your routine, such as watching porn or staying up late. Are there other ways you could relax and recharge that wouldn't disrupt your sleep cycle and productivity? For example, you could try reading a book, taking a walk, or practicing some gentle stretches before bed.

Another approach might be to create a ""stop doing"" list for your weekends - things you're going to intentionally avoid, like sleeping in too late or getting sucked into screens before bed. And when it comes to socializing with friends, could you find ways to do that during the day or early evening, so it doesn't interfere with your sleep schedule? 

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take breaks and have some downtime on the weekends - you don't have to be productive every waking moment. But by finding a balance between rest and responsibility, you might be able to create a more sustainable and disciplined routine that carries over into your weekdays.","Hey, I get it. Weekends can be a discipline black hole! It sounds like you've got a good weekday routine, so let's try to bridge that to the weekend.

First, instead of thinking of the weekend as a free-for-all, try scheduling in just *one* important task or chore for Saturday and Sunday mornings. Just one! This helps maintain momentum. It could be something small, like laundry or meal prepping for the week.

Second, the Friday night thing is a big trigger. Maybe try replacing the porn habit with something else you enjoy that's less draining. Could be reading, a hobby, or even just going for a walk. The key is to consciously choose an alternative.

Third, with the late nights with friends, try suggesting earlier meetups or activities that don't revolve around staying out super late. Maybe brunch instead of late-night drinks? Or a daytime activity like hiking or a museum visit?

Finally, remember that slip-ups happen. Don't beat yourself up if you have a bad weekend. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the following week. Consistency is key, not perfection. Good luck!

First, try adjusting the settings on your monitor to reduce eye strain—lower the brightness, use a blue light filter, or increase the text size. You might also want to experiment with different reading apps or software that offer a more book-like experience, such as a sepia background or page-turning animations. Setting a specific time each day for reading can help build a routine, and starting with shorter reading sessions can make it feel less daunting. Lastly, consider taking regular breaks to rest your eyes and stretch. Over time, these small adjustments can make reading on a screen feel more natural and enjoyable. Keep at it, and happy reading!","Reading on screens can definitely feel different from physical books, but there are several ways to make it more comfortable and natural. First, try adjusting your monitor settings - reducing brightness, enabling night mode, or using apps like f.lux can make the experience easier on your eyes. 

Since you're using a 32-inch monitor, consider reducing the window size of your PDF reader so it's not taking up the full screen. This can make it feel more book-like and less overwhelming. You might also want to increase the margins and line spacing to improve readability.

A good way to build the habit is to start with short reading sessions - maybe 15-20 minutes - and gradually increase the duration as you get more comfortable. Setting a specific time each day for reading can help make it feel more routine.

If motivation is the main challenge, try treating your digital books like physical ones - create a cozy reading spot at your desk, maybe with a cup of tea or coffee, and minimize other distractions. You could also join online reading groups or track your reading progress using apps like Goodreads to stay motivated.

Remember that adapting to screen reading is like building any other habit - it takes time and consistency.

You could also try setting a specific reading schedule and sticking to it, so it becomes a habit. Additionally, explore different PDF readers or e-book apps that allow you to customize the layout, font size, and margins to make reading more pleasant. Lastly, reward yourself after reaching certain milestones, like finishing a chapter or a certain number of pages each day. This might help motivate you to look forward to your daily screen reading sessions.","Hey! I get it, reading on a screen can be a drag when you prefer physical books. A few things you could try:

First, experiment with the display settings. Lower the brightness, adjust the color temperature to a warmer setting (less blue light), and see if that makes it easier on your eyes. Many devices have a ""night mode"" specifically for this.

Second, think about *how* you're reading. Are you sitting comfortably? Is the monitor at the right height and distance? Good ergonomics can make a big difference.

Third, maybe try different reading apps or PDF viewers. Some have features like adjustable margins, font sizes, and even text-to-speech if you just want to listen sometimes.

t3_zpx7sl,[Need Advice] How do I get rid of my maths anxiety?,"So I'm in my senior year of highschool and I am one of those people who can score good (around 80-85%) in maths if they put in their efforts. I am able to understand the basic concepts but when i get to practice, i am not able to get myself to start or even do more than 3 ques. I get this anxiety at the thought of solving a maths ques. Please tell me how i can get rid of this anxiety and get myself to practice maths more often. I've not been able to score well in my exams and I have my finals in a month!","Leave behind the idea of you being “good” at math. Probably the anxiety is coming from you being afraid of failing to answer the question, and therefore you lose the motivation. Just understand that you likely dont know shit, and enjoy the process of learning rather than holding on to your past achievements.","The trick is, don’t focus on getting rid of your anxiety

You can’t. Not even if you were a Buddhist monk. You cannot get rid of it.

So where does that leave you? What CAN you do?

The only thing you can really do, is accept that it’s there. It can’t hurt you. It’s just this… feeling. Bring awareness to it, treat it like an old friend that is there to help you do your math study.

If you can, you can even talk to the feeling like it’s a small child. I would say something like, “I know you’re feeling anxious, it’s okay, now let’s have a look at this math problem together, I’m sure if we work as a team, we can figure it out!”

And then approach your maths and see how you go.

Don’t focus on removing the anxiety, acknowledge it, accept it, comfort it and bring it with you and then focus on your study.

Let me know if you have any questions.","Math anxiety is super common, so you're definitely not alone in this. Here are a few strategies that might help you tackle it:

1. **Break it Down**: Start with small, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about a whole set of problems, focus on just one or two at a time. This can make the task feel less overwhelming.

2. **Set a Timer**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and reduce the pressure of having to study for long periods.

3. **Positive Reinforcement**: Reward yourself after completing a set number of problems. It could be something small like a snack or a short break to do something you enjoy.

4. **Practice Mindfulness**: Before you start, take a few deep breaths or try a short meditation to calm your mind. This can help reduce anxiety and improve concentration.

5. **Seek Help**: If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask a teacher or a friend for help. Sometimes a different perspective can make a concept click.

6. **Visualize Success**: Picture yourself solving problems successfully. This can build confidence and reduce anxiety over time.

Remember, progress is more important than perfection. Good luck with your finals!","Math anxiety is really common, and the good news is you already know you're capable of doing well when you put in the effort. Here's what's worked for many students in your situation:

Start with just 10 minutes of practice each day. Set a timer and commit to working on just 2-3 problems during that time. The key is making it so small that it feels almost too easy to fail. Once you build momentum with this tiny habit, you can gradually increase the time.

Break down each practice session into concrete steps: First, read the problem. Then write down what you know and what you need to find. Next, identify which concepts/formulas apply. This systematic approach makes starting feel less overwhelming than jumping straight into solving.

Keep a ""wins journal"" where you write down every problem you successfully solve, no matter how simple. This builds confidence over time and gives you proof that you can do it.

For your upcoming finals, pick one type of problem each day to master. Work through examples from easiest to hardest. When you get stuck, take a 5-minute break, then try again or ask for help. Remember - getting stuck is part of learning, not a sign of failure.

You've got this! Focus on small, consistent practice rather than marathon study sessions. Your anxiety will naturally decrease as you build confidence through regular practice.","It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of math anxiety, which is totally normal. One strategy that might help is to break down your practice sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of trying to tackle a large set of questions at once, start with just one or two problems and see if you can build up from there. This can help make the task feel less overwhelming and allow you to focus on making progress rather than getting bogged down by anxiety. Additionally, try to identify what specifically is causing your anxiety - is it the fear of getting questions wrong, the pressure of performing well on exams, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of the root cause, you can start working on ways to address it. For example, you could try practicing with a friend or family member who can offer support and encouragement, or reward yourself for reaching small milestones in your practice sessions. With your finals coming up in a month, it's also important to create a study schedule that allows you to consistently practice and review math concepts without feeling too much pressure. Remember, it's not about being perfect - it's about making progress and developing a growth mindset. You've already shown that you're capable of scoring well when you put in the effort, so try to focus on building on that momentum rather than getting caught up in anxiety.","Hey, I totally get the math anxiety thing. It's super common, especially with big exams looming. Here's what helped me:

First, break down the problem. Instead of thinking ""I need to practice math,"" think ""I'm going to do *one* problem."" Seriously, just one. Set a timer for like, 10 minutes. If you get it done, great! If not, that's okay too. You spent 10 minutes on math. Baby steps.

Second, focus on understanding *why* you're stuck, not just getting the right answer. When you get stuck on those 3 problems, don't just give up. Look at the solution, but really try to understand the *process* they used. Then, try to explain it to yourself (or even better, to someone else). Teaching it is a great way to learn it.

Third, and this is key: celebrate the small wins. Did you do one problem? Awesome! Did you spend 15 minutes trying even if you didn't solve it? Still awesome! Acknowledge the effort. It's about building momentum, not perfection.

Finally, a month is still plenty of time. Don't try to cram everything in. Consistent, small efforts are way more effective than marathon study sessions fueled by panic. You got this!

t3_t79tsh,[Need Advice] i can't do anything anymore,"To keep it simple, I have been struggling with issues of possible ADHD, complete lack of focus, beyond extreme procrastination (leaving everything to the last 2 hours, be it mid-term exams or even simple things like playing a game), this has been increasing and getting worse since the last 3 years, I feel constantly braindead, whenever I want to do something, I feel tired, or I spend 30 minutes to 5 hours circling around on my phone (even though I uninstalled all social media applications) and going deep in my thoughts instead of actually working.  
I have lost all feelings of fear and completely lost my self-control, my final exams are in 3 months, and I haven't done any work.  
I keep wasting my time playing videogames of which I get very little enjoyment from because of a complete lack of putting in the effort to actually get better at them.  
I had very few hobbies, playing some simple musical instruments, and video editing, I had a knack for making things like funny videos such as YTMVPs, and I threw both of those in the trash, the only thing that can bring me joy is my eternal slavery to videogames, which I continue to lather myself in, despite the fact that I no longer find them fun.  
Trying to fix my issue has only lead to having mood swings and being lost in where to start or what to do.  
It's also like my brain is searching for activity, or something to keep itself busy, but only if it has instant gratification/fun from doing so, I find myself fidgeting and being in a state of mini-euphoria whenever I am doing anything I perceive as ""fun"", but whenever I have to put in effort, it's like I get depressed/anxious, i've tried everything from the 'Pomodoro' method to straight up locking my computer up in a cellar to avoid distraction, is this just laziness, or borderline mental dysfunction?

Am I hopeless? or is there still a way? please help me, r/getdisciplined, I have to do something.","I think you need to see a doctor to see if you have a treatable condition like ADHD, depression, or anxiety. Changing your habits is transformational, but it's awfully hard to do if you're not medically well.",Hey u/909q909 I would say accountability. Do you ever feel that you only do the unpleasant thing under extreme pressure or when there is someone you care for/like that you need to impress or do it for?,"Hey there! First off, you're definitely not hopeless, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and while I'm not a professional, I can offer some tips that might help you get started on a better path.

1. **Small Steps**: Start with tiny, manageable goals. Instead of thinking about studying for hours, aim for just 10-15 minutes. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.

2. **Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine. It doesn't have to be perfect, but having a set time to wake up, study, and relax can help create a sense of normalcy and control.

3. **Breaks and Rewards**: Use breaks as a reward system. After a short study session, give yourself a small reward, like a quick walk or a snack. This can help train your brain to associate effort with positive outcomes.

4. **Limit Distractions**: Since you've already uninstalled social media, maybe try setting specific times for gaming or phone use. This way, you can enjoy them without them taking over your day.

5. **Seek Support**: If possible, talk to someone about how you're feeling. Whether it's a friend, family member, or a counselor, having someone to share your struggles with can be really helpful.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep trying and be kind to yourself in the process. You've got this!","From what you've described, this sounds a lot more like potential ADHD than simple laziness. The constant need for stimulation, difficulty with tasks requiring sustained effort, and struggles with executive function are classic signs. Getting properly evaluated by a mental health professional would be a good first step.

But you're definitely not hopeless. Let's focus on what you can do right now to start turning things around:

First, accept that cold turkey approaches like locking away your computer probably won't work long-term. Instead, start incredibly small. Pick ONE 10-minute block each day where you'll study. That's it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast. The goal isn't productivity - it's just building the tiny habit of showing up.

For gaming, set a strict timer for 1 hour of play. When it goes off, you must do something else for at least 15 minutes before gaming again. This helps break the compulsive cycle while still allowing some enjoyment.

Your brain is clearly crying out for dopamine hits. Give it some through healthier channels - take a 10 minute walk, do 5 pushups, or spend 5 minutes practicing an instrument. These build in natural rewards that aren't as intense as gaming but are more sustainable.

For the final exams - break everything into absurdly small chunks. Don't think ""study chapter 5."" Think ""read one page"" or ""do two practice problems."" String these micro-tasks together and you'll build momentum.

The key is to stop fighting your brain's need for stimulation and instead work with it. Use timers, frequent breaks, and tiny goals. Build from there. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help - that shows you have the self-awareness and motivation to improve. Take it one tiny step at a time.","It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough combination of challenges, and it's great that you're reaching out for help. First, let's acknowledge that this doesn't sound like simple laziness - the fact that you've tried various methods to stay on track and are still struggling suggests there may be some underlying issues at play, possibly related to ADHD or other mental health concerns. 

Given your struggles with focus and procrastination, it might be helpful to start small and work on building tiny habits that you can actually stick to. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one thing you want to work on - like studying for your exams or practicing a musical instrument - and commit to doing it for just 5-10 minutes a day. That's it. Don't worry about being productive or achieving some big goal, just focus on showing up and doing the thing for that short amount of time.

It's also worth considering seeking out professional help, whether that's a therapist or a doctor who can help you explore the possibility of ADHD or other underlying conditions. They may be able to provide you with more targeted strategies and support to help you get back on track.

As for your hobbies, it might be helpful to try to rekindle some of that old spark - not by feeling like you need to create something perfect, but just by doing the thing for its own sake. So, instead of trying to make a funny video, just mess around with video editing software for a bit and see what happens. You might find that it helps you tap into some of that creative energy and motivation.

Lastly, be kind to yourself - it's okay to not have everything figured out right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not hopeless, and there is definitely still a way forward. It's just going to take some patience, self-compassion, and experimentation to find what works for you.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but definitely not hopeless. It's great that you're reaching out and recognizing the need for change.

First, regarding the possible ADHD, it's worth getting a professional assessment. A diagnosis (or ruling it out) can give you clarity and open doors to appropriate strategies and support. Don't self-diagnose, but definitely explore it with a doctor or therapist.

Second, let's tackle the procrastination and lack of focus. Three months is still enough time to make a difference for your exams. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, start small. Pick *one* subject and commit to studying it for just 15 minutes each day. Seriously, just 15. Use a timer. The goal isn't to master the subject in 15 minutes, it's to break the inertia and build a habit. Once you're consistently doing 15 minutes, gradually increase it.

Third, address the video game issue. Cold turkey might not be sustainable. Instead, try setting strict time limits and only allowing yourself to play *after* you've completed your study goal for the day. Make it a reward, not a default. Also, actively seek out alternative activities. Remember those musical instruments and video editing? Even if you don't feel the ""knack"" right away, force yourself to spend 30 minutes on one of them. The joy might return with practice.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not lazy, you're struggling. Acknowledge the effort you *are* making, even if it feels small. Celebrate small wins. And remember, progress isn't linear. There will be setbacks, but don't let them derail you. Get back on track the next day. You've got this.

t3_110dhf8,[Need Advice] How do I deal with the shame/guilt after I felt really good and liberated(happy)?,"So last night (and other nights too) **after a night out where i felt really good** and jokingly roasted everyone (I asked them and they didnt mind it, i didnt bring them down nor i had the intention to do that) and were in the groups discussion (it is hard for me cause i have speech defect) i feel shame and guild. **I feel shame and guilt about the person i am in that moment** cause that person is totally different that im in every day. I think if i would have met myself when im liberated i would not talk to myself or even go near me. 

I have a small social anxiety (as everyone) and speech anxiety, but these are bypassed when im feeling good in this partitullar group. Im working on my communication skills (cause i have almost 0), but it is really hard to discover my shortcomings and i think im on the autistic spectrum (just a little) for example 98 per 100 time i dont feel uncomfortable silence, dont know what to say when meeting someone and what when saying goodbye, how to respond someone who told something about his/hers feelings or a random event that he/she went on etc. **I feel like i can never get my thoughts across to others, they dont understand what im saying (even if they do).** And i dont want any misunderstanding. **I feel like i did something bad every time.**

I feel this almost every time after talking to someone  or talking with a teacher, friend, stranger etc. **I always feel like i said something that is not matching word/not corresponding with the situation like i did something unforgettably bad to them.**. I think im not trying to please anyone, but **i have this unsolvable paradox that i want to be the cool quiet kid who is really considered about everything and the same time i want to be the spontaneous kid**. My psychologist said it could be cause my (divorced)parents are totally different and they ""represent"" this dilemma of mine, it sounds logical, but i dont know yet...

*I hope my thoughts are understandable and logical. I dont know if it is the right community for something like this but i would be happy if someone would give me some advice.*

*TL;DR: Look at the bold text*","Not sure if this is the right sub for this; this may be more appropriate in r/mentalhealth. But I'm glad to hear you're seeing a psychologist. Sounds like there's some internal stuff that needs to be worked through and you're already working on it. That's great! My advice would just to be patient. These things can take time, but you're further ahead now than you were in the past. Keep going! You have a determined attitude and because of that, you'll be okay.",Thank you! I will try there.,"It sounds like you're navigating a complex mix of emotions and social dynamics, which is totally normal. First off, it's great that you're working on your communication skills and seeing a psychologist—those are solid steps. Feeling guilt or shame after social interactions can be tough, but remember, it's okay to have different sides to your personality. You don't have to fit into one mold all the time. 

One thing that might help is to practice self-compassion. When you feel that post-interaction guilt, remind yourself that it's okay to be imperfect and that your friends didn't mind your jokes. You could also try reflecting on these interactions afterward, maybe jotting down what went well and what you might want to adjust next time. This can help you see patterns and gradually build confidence in your social skills.

Lastly, try to embrace the fact that it's okay to be both the ""cool quiet kid"" and the ""spontaneous kid."" You can be both, depending on the situation and how you feel. It's all part of being human. Keep working on understanding yourself, and over time, you'll likely find a balance that feels right for you.","Hey there - what you're describing is actually pretty common, especially for people working on their social skills. That back-and-forth between feeling great in the moment and then second-guessing everything afterwards can be really draining.

Here's something that might help: Start keeping quick notes after social interactions where you felt good. Write down what went well, how others responded positively, and any genuine laughs or good moments you shared. When the shame spiral tries to kick in later, you can look back at these concrete examples that show you weren't actually being harmful or inappropriate.

The paradox you mentioned about wanting to be both the quiet, thoughtful person and the spontaneous one isn't actually a paradox - it's totally possible to be both. Think of it like having different gears for different situations. Sometimes you're in quiet mode, other times you're in social mode, and both are equally valid parts of who you are.

One practical exercise: Next time you're with that particular group where you feel comfortable, try to notice what specifically makes you feel safe enough to be more outgoing. Maybe it's their body language, their reactions, or the overall vibe. Understanding these elements can help you gradually bring that confidence into other social situations.

Remember - if people keep hanging out with you and actively tell you they don't mind your jokes, they're probably being honest. Trust their words rather than the anxious voice that shows up afterwards.

Keep working with your psychologist on this, but know that you're already making progress by being aware and working on your communication skills. That's more than many people ever do.","It sounds like you're struggling with a bit of an identity crisis, where the person you are in social situations doesn't align with your everyday self, and that's causing feelings of shame and guilt. First, let's acknowledge that it's completely normal to have different personas in different situations - it doesn't mean you're being fake or insincere, it just means you're adapting to your environment.

It's great that you've found a group where you feel liberated and can be yourself without worrying about your speech defect or social anxiety. Instead of beating yourself up over the fact that this persona is different from your everyday self, try to see it as a strength - you're able to connect with people and have fun in a way that feels authentic to you in that moment.

Regarding your concerns about communication skills and feeling like you're not getting your thoughts across, it might be helpful to focus on the fact that people are more likely to remember how you made them feel than the exact words you used. So, even if you don't always say the ""right"" thing, if you're coming from a place of kindness and genuine interest, that's what will shine through.

As for your paradox of wanting to be both the cool quiet kid and the spontaneous kid, maybe it's not about choosing one or the other, but about finding a balance between the two. You can work on developing your communication skills and being more confident in social situations, while also embracing your quieter side and learning to navigate those uncomfortable silences.

Lastly, it's great that you're working with a psychologist to explore these feelings and concerns - that takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. Keep doing the work and be patient with yourself - it's okay to take time to figure out who you are and how you want to show up in the world.","Hey, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's awesome that you're reaching out and trying to understand yourself better. That's a huge first step.

It seems like you're struggling with reconciling different versions of yourself and then feeling guilty about it. A couple of thoughts: First, it's totally normal to act differently in different social situations. We all have different ""modes"" depending on who we're with and the environment. Don't beat yourself up too much about not being a single, consistent personality.

Second, that feeling of saying something ""wrong"" or not being understood is super common, especially with social anxiety. One thing that might help is to actively listen and try to mirror the other person's communication style. Pay attention to their body language and the way they phrase things. It can make you feel more in sync and reduce that feeling of mismatch.

Also, maybe try journaling after social interactions. Write down what you said, how you felt, and what you think the other person's reaction was. Over time, you might start to see patterns in your thinking and identify specific triggers for your anxiety. It can also help you realize that things probably weren't as bad as you thought they were in the moment.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're working on your communication skills, and that takes time and effort. Celebrate the small wins and don't get discouraged by setbacks. Maybe even try setting small, achievable goals for each social interaction, like making eye contact or asking one follow-up question. Good luck, you got this!

Exam’s just a month far and all these past few days I’ve done is look for online dates and singles in my area.
Watched porn and fapped all day, all to avoid studying.

Even when I study , I take too many breaks.
And when I don’t take break, I fantasize about BS and what if’s .

And in the end, I get scared thinking about the outcomes. And so I avoid it all together .

I let myself get distracted from even slightest of distractions.

And just so you know how important this exam is,
See, if I pass this exam, I’ll get admitted into the Top 100 Universities on earth. And with that my road to MIT will be clear. By passing this exam, there’s roughly about 60% chance of me getting admission into MIT ( The best in the whole world )

It’s all looking like a dream now , 
Back then, it was a definite possibility, but now it’s slowly turning into dream.

If that self inflicted pressure is negated, through clarity of the fact that you want it because either your neighbor wants it or you have the ego to prove your mettle, then everything including the prep for some exam becomes an interesting game.

Ofc all these are advice from someone who's a slacker & a coward, like most of us. But I know you can have a glimpse of what's real after reading & understanding what I have to say.

What would happen if you failed the exam?","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First off, remember that it's completely normal to feel pressure and anxiety when something important is on the line. The key is to channel that energy into productive action. Here are a few things you might try:

1. **Break it Down**: Instead of thinking about the exam as one huge task, break your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. Set daily goals that are achievable and specific. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

2. **Create a Schedule**: Structure can be your best friend right now. Make a study schedule that includes breaks and stick to it. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus.

3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify your biggest distractions and find ways to minimize them. This might mean setting specific times for social media or using apps that block distracting sites while you study.

4. **Visualize Success**: Spend a few minutes each day visualizing yourself succeeding in the exam. This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.

5. **Stay Active**: Physical activity can be a great stress reliever. Even a short walk or some stretching can clear your mind and improve focus.

6. **Reach Out**: If possible, talk to someone who has been through this process or a mentor who can offer guidance and support.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've got a month to go, and that's plenty of time to make a difference. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!","The pressure you're feeling is completely normal given what's at stake. But here's the thing - you're sabotaging yourself because you're afraid of giving it your all and still failing. It's easier to say ""I didn't really try"" than ""I tried my absolute hardest and it wasn't enough.""

First, you need to accept that failure is possible even with your best effort. That's scary, but it's also liberating. When you truly accept this, you can stop avoiding the work and start focusing on what's in your control - your daily actions.

For the next month, create a strict daily schedule. Break your study sessions into 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro technique). Start with just 4 chunks per day and gradually increase. During study time, put your phone in another room and use website blockers for distracting sites.

Each evening, write down your specific study goals for the next day. Make them concrete and achievable - like ""Complete practice problems 1-20"" rather than just ""study hard.""

Remember, MIT isn't a dream - it's a goal that requires consistent action. Whether you succeed or fail won't be determined by fate or luck, but by what you do in these next 30 days. Every time you feel the urge to procrastinate, ask yourself: ""What would my future self want me to do right now?""

You've already put in a year of preparation. Don't let fear waste that investment. Start small, but start now. The next 30 days can change everything, but only if you're willing to be uncomfortable and face the pressure head-on.","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of fear of failure and procrastination, which is totally understandable given the high stakes of this exam. One thing that might help is to break down your studying into smaller, manageable chunks, so it doesn't feel as overwhelming. Instead of thinking ""I need to study for hours every day,"" try telling yourself ""I'll study for 25 minutes without any breaks, and then I can take a 5-minute break."" This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.

It's also important to address the underlying fear that's holding you back. You mentioned that you're afraid of failure, but it sounds like you're also afraid of not living up to your own potential. Try to reframe your thinking around this exam - instead of ""I need to pass this exam or my life will be ruined,"" tell yourself ""I'm going to do my best to prepare for this exam, and whatever happens, I'll learn from the experience and move forward."" Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you can always try again.

As for the distractions, it might be helpful to remove or limit your access to them while you're studying. Try turning off your phone or putting it in a different room, or using a website blocker to prevent yourself from getting sidetracked by social media or other online temptations.

Lastly, remind yourself why this goal is important to you - getting into MIT is a huge opportunity, and it's worth putting in the hard work to achieve it. You've already come so far and prepared for an entire year, don't give up now. You got this!","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's awesome that you're reaching out and recognizing the issue. Procrastination and avoidance are super common when the stakes feel high.

First, cut yourself some slack. You've been working hard for a year, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. But you're right, you need to shift gears.

Instead of thinking about the whole exam and MIT, break things down. What's one small, specific thing you can study for 30 minutes *right now*? Seriously, close Reddit and do that one thing. Then take a *real* break – get up, walk around, grab a healthy snack.

The key is to build momentum. Small wins lead to bigger wins. Try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused study, 5-minute break. Repeat. It helps manage the urge to get distracted.

Also, be honest with yourself about the distractions. Block those dating sites and maybe use a website blocker for porn. It's temporary, just for this month.

Regarding the ""what ifs,"" try writing them down. Get them out of your head. Then, write down counter-arguments. Challenge those negative thoughts.

Finally, remember why you started. Visualize yourself at MIT. Feel that accomplishment. Use that as fuel. You've got this. One month is plenty of time to make a difference. Good luck!

t3_piy3nt,[Plan][Need Advice] The 500 hour detox,"NOTE: Wrote in a bit of rush. So if my grammar is a little bit off. My bad. I'll edit it when I can.

Also it's gonna be a long one with a story... Here it goes.

My name is u/somedudeafar and I'm an internet addict.

I am 28 years old, single, work a crappy part-time job as a shift manager at a supermarket and I'm wasting my life in front screens. Big ones, small ones and ones big as your head (sorry!). I am a masters degree dropout and what I like to call a stop/starter/giveup'erer(?) and I'm trying my best to get my attention span back to get into a career in IT and to get to my dream role as a systems administrator within the next few years or so.

A few weeks ago it dawned upon me how much I was spending in front of not only a computer screen, but by watching YouTube videos on every device imaginable as well as deadscrolling social media to get that dopamine kick then getting burnt out to the point after all-nighter binge watching/playing of trivial entertainment. I would wake up in the morning feeling groggy, as if I had a hangover, but without the headache, and the rest of my day would be counterproductive. I would only feel motivated and perked up to do something is if I know I have a task or deadline to do through my role as a shift manager and if I go to the gym.

I have a backlog of video games, movies and books to read and it depresses me about how much I've neglected and left unfinished over the past few years or so. Also, I would be cathartic and upset seeing people on social media (almost akin to Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar receiving messages from his loved ones after landing on that planet where one minute is seven hours) who I've known for years move on with their lives... and there's me still living at my parents house, just going upstairs to my room after work, lying on my double bed and watching YouTube on my Smart TV - alone.

Seeing my nephews and nieces grow up after not meeting them for so long also knocked me back a lot. My oldest nephew and niece are 15 and 13 respectively and I've barely seen them in my life because of my lack of motivation even when I had free time (alongside family drama, but still I could of made those journeys to the other side of the city to see them). Seeing my nephew tower above me in height and my niece a spitting image of my sister the other day when I took them to the cinema nearly drove me to the verge of tears almost. I missed so much.

***That was the cherry on top.***

**tl;dr:** Late 20's guy, crappy job and want to go further. Only time I am disciplined is work and gym. Moment of clarity from seeing backlog of media, knowing my ""addiction"" and my older nephew and niece all grown up. Time to make a change.

**The Plan**

I took heed on what would be causing my issues. So I made a list of how many devices I own, what websites I would visit and I set a timer to see how long I would stay on listed websites for. I can't post my times because I feel humiliated to do so. For all intents and purposes let's just say I was on there for a very, very long time (Say, half the day or more)

I also did the peculiar thing of noting down any key events in the last few years or so that would lead me to possibly block Anything out. I previously mentioned family drama but I also suffer from severe Imposter syndrome, had a few bad relationships and friendships here and there as well as deaths in the family and what not. Also, noting ""arduous"" tasks like job searches and emailing people then using YouTube and Facebook as tools to sidetrack myself on purpose.

I took into consideration as to why I was more disciplined with the gym and work my conclusion was there was deadlines for work and a goal for the gym (which is to keep me mentally and physically active). Also, the instant gratification issue of this current internet age played a factor. From the dopamine hits you get from being entertained and then that brain fog and fatigue afterwards.

The past couple of days I planned a 500 hour change (roughly three weeks) and I've done the following:

&#x200B;

* **I deactivated facebook, Twitter and other key websites I know I'll be hooked on for 3 weeks (roughly 500 hours).**
* **Utilising the phone as a tool as NOT as an entertainment device to alleviate boredom.**
* **I've also deleted Spotify off my desktop and laptop.**
* **Blocked YouTube off my desktop and deleted it off my phone.**
* **Delegating some apps to certain devices as well as blocking websites using Stayfocusd on Chrome.** (i.e. Spotify to my phone for podcasts and music in the car and gym)
* **Also disconnected the internet off my Smart TV, only using my PS4 for Netflix and because the YouTube app doesn't work on there for some reason and no, I don't want to fix it.**
* **My phone, tablet and laptop are either in another room or locked away/on charge on the other side of the room so that they are out of reach away.**
* **Setting myself at least 2-3 hours a day to help educate myself to reach my goal of getting my foot in the door towards my career goal.**
* **Setting myself up a physical and digital workspace (folders for entertainment and work) and getting rid of distractions. Working in another room if need be to keep me away from them.**
* **Keeping to a solid sleep pattern given my current shifts (trying to get 7 to 8 hours a night)**

If anyone can offer me any more I could do? Or if this is good enough or needs some changes? Let me know.

**My GOAL**

**My goal is to hopefully get myself into a jumpstart mode; getting me out of this rut I've got myself into and to stop using the internet as a means of abiding and wasting my days away. I go to the gym, I have a job that I want to get out of and I have a goal in mind. My issue is my discipline. My aim now is to get disciplined and be able to study and pass one of my IT certifications to get my foot in the door and keep on going.**

***I'm gonna start as of posting this message. Wish me luck!***",,,"Hey u/somedudeafar, first off, kudos for taking such a big step towards change! It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into your plan, and that's a great start. Here are a few suggestions that might help you stay on track:

1. **Accountability Partner**: Find someone you trust to check in with you regularly about your progress. It could be a friend, family member, or even someone from an online community. Sharing your goals and updates can keep you motivated.

2. **Small Wins**: Break down your 500-hour detox into smaller milestones. Celebrate each week or even each day you stick to your plan. This can help maintain your motivation and give you a sense of accomplishment.

3. **Mindfulness Practices**: Consider incorporating mindfulness or meditation into your routine. It can help you manage stress and improve your focus, making it easier to resist the urge to fall back into old habits.

4. **Reward System**: Set up a reward system for yourself. For example, if you stick to your study schedule for a week, treat yourself to something you enjoy (that doesn't involve screens).

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of each week, take some time to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Be flexible and adjust your plan as needed to better suit your needs.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep moving forward. You've got this! Good luck with your detox and your journey towards your IT career!","This is a solid, well-thought-out plan. The fact that you've already identified your triggers, created specific countermeasures, and set a defined timeframe shows you're approaching this systematically rather than just trying to wing it.

A few suggestions to strengthen your approach:

Consider adding a daily journal or log to track your progress during these 500 hours. Write down what worked, what didn't, and most importantly - how you handled moments when you felt the urge to fall back into old habits. This will help you identify patterns and adjust your strategy as needed.

Since you mentioned being disciplined at work and the gym, try applying what makes you successful in those areas to your study time. For example, if having a set schedule at work helps you stay focused, create a similar fixed schedule for your IT cert studying. Same time, same place, every day.

One potential challenge I see is that 2-3 hours of studying might be ambitious right off the bat. You might want to start with 1 hour and gradually build up, especially since you're also making significant changes to your media consumption habits. It's better to consistently hit a smaller target than to get discouraged by missing a larger one.

Remember that this isn't just about removing distractions - it's about building new habits. Try to fill those newly empty hours with specific activities rather than just avoiding the old ones. Maybe join some local tech meetups or find an accountability partner who's also studying for IT certs.

Your plan looks promising, and the fact that you're already disciplined in some areas of your life shows you have the capability. Now it's just about extending that same discipline to other areas.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your struggles with internet addiction, and I commend you for taking the first step towards making a change. Your 500 hour plan is quite comprehensive, and it's great that you've identified specific areas where you want to improve and set clear goals for yourself.

One thing that might be helpful is to track your progress and reflect on how you're feeling throughout this journey. Since you've already started setting timers and noting down key events, consider keeping a journal or log to monitor your daily activities, thoughts, and emotions. This can help you identify patterns, stay motivated, and make adjustments as needed.

Additionally, it's excellent that you've set aside dedicated time for self-education and created a physical and digital workspace. To further minimize distractions, you might want to consider implementing a ""stop doing"" list, where you identify specific habits or activities that derail your focus and make a conscious effort to avoid them.

Remember that discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly, and it's okay to have setbacks. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – instead, learn from the experience and get back on track. You've already demonstrated discipline in your work and gym routine, so it's definitely possible to translate that to other areas of your life.

Lastly, having a support system can make a huge difference. Consider sharing your goals and progress with a trusted friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. You got this, and I'm rooting for you! Good luck on your journey towards developing discipline and achieving your IT certification goals.","Hey, that's a really solid plan! It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into identifying your triggers and setting up your environment for success.

A few things that might help you stick with it:

*   **Don't go cold turkey on everything.** You've blocked a lot, which is great for a detox, but think about *reintroducing* things strategically after the 3 weeks. Maybe allocate specific times for certain sites, so you're in control, not the algorithm.
*   **Have a plan for boredom.** You're going to feel it, especially at first. Have a list of alternative activities ready to go – things you genuinely enjoy that don't involve screens. This could be anything from reading a physical book to going for a walk.
*   **Track your progress.** Seeing how far you've come can be a huge motivator. A simple journal or even a spreadsheet where you log your study time and how you're feeling can make a big difference.
*   **Be kind to yourself.** You're bound to slip up at some point. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. One slip-up doesn't negate all the progress you've made.
*   **Reward yourself (appropriately).** When you hit milestones, celebrate! But make sure the rewards align with your goals. Maybe treat yourself to a nice meal or a new book instead of falling back into old habits.

Good luck with the detox! You've got this.

t3_y1djy0,[Need Advice] I Want to Stop Being an Idea Guy,"I’m stuck feeling like I’m full of ideas for my own or other people’s games and stories but I don’t have the skills to make them. Programming makes my head spin I tried for months to learn blender but got too distracted and gave up without making masterpiece animations, and got stuck never completing a donut tutorial so I’m stuck in an phase of being jaded and feeling cheated like I have all these ideas and share them freely but there’s no appreciation or prospective future in doing so.

I suppose the easy answer is learn. A post in a game dev Reddit told me to come here but I haven’t seen massive improvements to convince me I’m succeeding at discipline or getting to a point where I can say I made the thing!

I suppose I’m warped and I’m sorry if I am flooding this Reddit with lots of possibly repeat posts. But I don’t feel like things are clicking in a way to make me launch into the path of hard work yet so I’m still here trying to find that spark that propels me correctly.

Again if I’m being absurd I’m sorry I really am.
I mean no harm I’m not evil! I just want my time to shine!",Take a clean break. Assess your priorities. Start afresh.,"There's nothing wrong with being an idea guy.  However, as you've noticed it's hard to be just ""purely"" the idea guy.

&#x200B;

Typically, idea guys don't make it far without a skill to back them up.  The skill doesn't necessarily have to be a hard skill such as: programming or art.  It can also be softer skills such as project management, or communication.

Either way, developing a skill, is a sure way to help get your ideas moving forward. For example, if you choose to be a very convincing manager/leader, who can listen to others and take their opinions into consideration, that can be a very valuable skill.  

You could become great at organization and management. You could get really good at raising funding and managing the assets to get people paid.

&#x200B;

So being an idea guy is good, but it can't be the only thing you have.  The reality is, you'll need another skill to back up and provide value.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a creative rut, which is totally normal. The key to moving from being an ""idea guy"" to a ""doer"" is to start small and build momentum. Instead of trying to master everything at once, pick one skill that excites you the most and set a tiny, achievable goal. For example, if you're interested in Blender, aim to complete just one simple project, like a basic model or animation. Celebrate that win, no matter how small it seems. Consistency is more important than intensity, so try to dedicate a short, regular time slot each day to practice. Over time, these small efforts will compound, and you'll start seeing progress. Remember, every expert was once a beginner, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your time to shine!","Hey there - it sounds like you're getting caught up in the gap between having big creative visions and the reality of learning new skills. This is super common, especially with technical skills like programming and 3D modeling.

Here's what's likely happening: You're setting the bar way too high for yourself right at the start. You mentioned wanting to make ""masterpiece animations"" before even finishing the donut tutorial. That's like expecting to write a bestselling novel before learning basic grammar.

The path forward is to radically lower your expectations for your early work. Instead of trying to create amazing things right away, commit to creating small, probably-terrible things consistently. Set a modest goal like ""I will spend 30 minutes every day working through basic Blender tutorials"" or ""I will complete one simple programming exercise each day.""

The key is to make your daily goal so small that it feels almost laughably easy. This builds consistency, which is far more important than intensity when you're starting out. Your only metric for success should be ""Did I show up and put in my 30 minutes today?""

Remember: Every skilled creator started by making bad stuff. The difference is they kept showing up, day after day, even when the results weren't impressive. Your time to shine will come through consistent small steps, not through waiting for some magical spark of motivation.

Pick one skill to focus on first, set tiny daily goals, and commit to showing up for 30 days straight. No expectations of greatness - just showing up and doing the work.","It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because you have a lot of creative ideas, but you're struggling to turn them into reality due to a lack of skills and discipline. First, let's acknowledge that having ideas is a valuable skill in itself, and it's great that you're willing to share them with others. However, if you want to take your ideas to the next level and create something tangible, you'll need to focus on building your skills and staying committed to your goals. 

Instead of trying to learn everything at once, why not start by picking one area you're interested in, like programming or animation, and set a specific, achievable goal for yourself? For example, you could try to complete a simple project in Blender, like modeling a basic object, within a certain timeframe. This will help you build momentum and confidence, which can be a powerful motivator. 

It's also important to remember that discipline is like a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly - it takes time and practice to develop. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results, and try to focus on making progress rather than being perfect. You've already taken the first step by recognizing your weaknesses and seeking help, so that's something to be proud of. Keep showing up, stay consistent, and you'll eventually start to see improvements in your skills and discipline.","Hey, I get the feeling of being an ""idea guy"" – it's frustrating to have all these cool concepts swirling around and not being able to bring them to life. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to immediately create masterpieces, and that's a recipe for getting stuck.

Instead of trying to learn everything at once, maybe try breaking things down into *tiny*, manageable steps. Forget the donut tutorial for now. What's the absolute smallest, simplest thing you could create in Blender? Maybe just a cube, and then try changing its color. Seriously. The point is to get a quick win and build momentum.

Also, consider focusing on *one* skill at a time. Jumping between programming and Blender might be spreading yourself too thin. Pick the one that excites you the most, and commit to just 15-30 minutes a day. Consistency is key, even if it feels like you're not making huge progress. Those small steps add up over time.

Finally, don't worry about ""appreciation"" for your ideas right now. Focus on building the skills to execute them. Once you have something tangible to show, that's when you can start thinking about sharing and getting feedback. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13u5u19,[Need Advice] How do you start to regulate yourself when you realise you are just a mess/never have.,"TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?

(30-Age)
Alright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don’t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very naïve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. 
Anyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.","I’ve been there, mate (I’m 37M). Until recently I was feeling the same way you do, but I am really turning things around. I’ve been doing what I can to turn myself around. I’ve been going to therapy, I’ve been working on myself by looking long and hard at my life, I’ve been working out consistently, journalling, cycling to work, Wim Hof method, etc. What really started to make a big difference was my diet - I went zero carb and my mental health improved dramatically. The effect would not have been so big without the other stuff, I think. 
In short - have faith, work on yourself, try every day, strive to be and one day you will wake up who you want to be.","1.Write down honestly what you are addicted to

2.Challenge yourself to be a certain amount of weeks without these addiction. Every time you succeed for a few days you have changed a little.

This way you will stop downing out you inner voice. Whenever you feel lost and don't know what to do stop whatever you are doing and do nothing at all. When you seek comfort in social media or entertainment you will never find yourself.

Believe me. You will come to this sensation of confusion over and over again. The only way to move forward is to spend in excessive amount of time with yourself. Your own mind, your creativity and your voice. Until you find what you really want to with your life.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and considering therapy and talking to a doctor. That's a huge step in the right direction. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar feelings and challenges.

Starting small can be really helpful. Pick one thing you want to work on and focus on that. It could be as simple as setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a hobby or exercise. The key is to build small, manageable habits that can gradually lead to bigger changes. 

Also, try to be kind to yourself. It's easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but remember that progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate your wins, even if they seem minor. 

Lastly, don't compare your journey to others. Everyone has their own path, and what works for someone else might not work for you. Focus on what makes you feel good and what you want to achieve. You've got this!","First off - you're not weak, and you're taking a huge positive step by seeking therapy and medical support. That's actually really strong.

Starting over with discipline when you feel scattered is tough, but here's what works: Start ridiculously small. I mean tiny. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE thing - maybe making your bed each morning, or drinking a glass of water when you wake up. Something so small it feels almost silly. Do just that one thing consistently for a week.

The key is building evidence for yourself that you CAN follow through. Each tiny win creates momentum. Once that first habit feels automatic (usually 1-2 weeks), add one more small thing. Maybe a 5-minute walk, or putting dishes directly in the dishwasher after eating.

Your ADD makes this harder, so work with it rather than against it. Use external systems - set specific times, use reminders, make things visible. Put your workout clothes right by your bed if exercise is your goal. Make the good choice the easy choice.

The self-hate stuff is rough, but action comes first, feelings follow. You don't need to feel worthy or confident to start - you just need to start. Focus on doing rather than feeling.

Remember: You're not starting over ""late"" - you're starting exactly when you needed to. Many people never start at all. Take it one absurdly small step at a time, celebrate those tiny wins, and keep building from there. You've got this.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge where you're at and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking this first step. It's clear that you've been carrying around a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's understandable that it's hard to envision a future for yourself when you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness. 

One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, focus on building one or two new habits that you can realistically stick to. This could be something as simple as taking a short walk each day, or dedicating 10 minutes each morning to meditation or journaling. The key is to build momentum and start to see yourself as capable of making positive changes.

It's also great that you're seeking out therapy and speaking with a doctor - having a support system in place can make a huge difference in your journey. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and that you don't have to have it all figured out right now. You're not weak for struggling with depression and anxiety - these are serious conditions that require treatment and support.

In terms of finding your passions and interests, you might try exploring different activities or hobbies without putting too much pressure on yourself to find ""the one thing"" that you're meant to do. Sometimes, it's the process of trying new things and seeing what sticks that can help us discover our strengths and interests. And don't worry if you don't have a clear vision for your future right now - that can develop over time as you continue to work on yourself and build your confidence.

Lastly, try to be kinder to yourself - it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks, and it doesn't mean that you're not worth it. You are worthy of growth, success, and happiness, regardless of your past or your struggles. Keep in mind that everyone starts from somewhere, and it's never too late to make a change and start building the life you want.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but the fact that you're reaching out and wanting to change is a huge first step. It's definitely not easy, but it's possible.

First, good on you for seeking therapy and talking to a doctor. That's crucial, especially with ADD and potential depression/anxiety. Meds can help level the playing field, and therapy can give you tools to manage your thoughts and behaviors.

As for the ""starting from zero"" feeling, I get it. It's overwhelming to think about fixing everything at once. Instead of a complete overhaul, try focusing on ONE small habit at a time. Seriously, just one. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or going for a 10-minute walk. Something achievable that you can consistently do. Once that feels automatic, add another small habit.

Regarding the lack of passion/career direction, don't beat yourself up. A lot of people feel that way. Instead of searching for some grand purpose, try exploring different activities. Volunteer, take a class, join a club – just try things that vaguely interest you. You might stumble upon something you enjoy, or at least learn what you *don't* like.

The self-sabotage and fear of success are common. Therapy can help you unpack those feelings. In the meantime, try reframing your thinking. Instead of ""I'm not worth it,"" try ""I deserve to give myself a chance."" It sounds cheesy, but small shifts in perspective can make a difference.

Finally, be patient with yourself. You're not going to transform overnight. There will be setbacks and days where you feel like you're back at square one. That's okay. Just keep showing up and trying. Celebrate small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this.

Im saying i cant because i wont because i am afraid of moving and i have ruined my life i cant and wont live in any better life Because i am too lazy

I dont want to accept this","Hey there! It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's totally okay. Change can be daunting, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here's a simple approach that might help: start small. Pick one tiny habit to focus on, something so easy you can't say no. It could be as simple as drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning or taking a 5-minute walk. The key is consistency, not intensity. 

Once you get comfortable with that, gradually add more small habits. This builds momentum and confidence. Also, try to be kind to yourself. It's normal to have setbacks, but what's important is getting back on track. Reflect on what truly matters to you and why you want to change. This can help you find motivation and direction. Remember, growth is a journey, not a destination. You've got this!","First, know that feeling stuck and overwhelmed is a common human experience - you're not alone in this struggle. The fact that you're reaching out shows you haven't given up, even if it feels that way.

Start incredibly small. Forget about massive life changes for now. Pick ONE tiny action you can do today - maybe making your bed, drinking a glass of water, or stepping outside for 2 minutes. The action itself matters less than building the tiniest sense of momentum.

The key is to prove to yourself that you can do something, anything, different from your current pattern. Your brain is currently wired to resist change because staying in the comfort zone feels safer. But each small win starts rewiring those neural pathways.

When you complete that tiny action, really let yourself feel good about it. Don't dismiss it as too small or meaningless. You're building evidence that you can take action, even when it's hard.

Tomorrow, do that same tiny thing again. Once it starts feeling automatic (might take days or weeks), add one more small action. The compound effect of these minimal changes will start shifting your mindset naturally.

For the emotional side - try this: When you notice yourself feeling like a victim, pause and ask ""What's one microscopic thing within my control right now?"" Then do that thing. Control builds through action, not the other way around.

Remember: You don't need to figure everything out at once. Just focus on proving to yourself that you're capable of small changes. The rest will build from there. Come back here anytime you need support or want to share your progress.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so kudos to you for reaching out and seeking help. It's clear that you want to make changes, but you're not sure where to start. One thing that might be helpful is to focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small, steps towards growth. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and take a single, tiny action towards it. For example, if you want to start exercising, your first step might be as simple as putting on your workout clothes or doing one push-up. It's not about achieving some kind of grand transformation overnight, but about building momentum and developing a sense of control and agency over your life. As for changing your mindset, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and challenge some of the negative self-talk that's holding you back. Instead of beating yourself up over your perceived weaknesses, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. Remember that personal growth is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, just a willingness to show up and take that first step.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of changes you want to make, and that feeling is paralyzing. It's totally understandable to feel that way.

Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, what if you started with *one tiny thing*? Seriously, something so small it feels almost ridiculous. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up. The point isn't the task itself, but the feeling of accomplishment you get from actually *doing* something.

That little win can create a tiny ripple effect. Once you've consistently done that one small thing for a week or two, add another. Maybe it's going for a 10-minute walk. Again, keep it small and manageable.

As for feeling like a victim, that's a tough one. A lot of times, that comes from focusing on what you *can't* control. Try shifting your focus to what you *can* control – your actions, your reactions, your choices in this very moment. Even if it's just choosing to get out of bed instead of staying there.

Finding your values is a longer process, but you can start by paying attention to what makes you feel angry or inspired. What injustices bother you? What kind of people do you admire? Those clues can point you in the right direction.

And finally, about fear... everyone's afraid of something. The key is to not let fear dictate your life. Start by identifying your biggest fear, then break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What's the smallest thing you can do to confront that fear, even just a little bit?

It's a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, celebrate the small victories, and remember that even tiny steps forward are still progress. You got this.

t3_z8fe9j,[Need Advice] How do you declutter your mind from overthinking and constant doubts?,"
Why does overthinking make you stop from achieving any goals or even stop you from attempting to start working on your goals or any tasks that you feel like completing and conquering.

It’s like our anxiety or whatever we feel sacred about makes us not want to do anything. It’s like a comfort state of mind but it’s actually messing up my life because I feel like I’m getting behind in my life when I’m not doing the things that I’m suppose to be doing, instead I’m living in some comfort zone. I just don’t know how to break that barrier and come to a realization. I mean I’m doing alot of self reflecting but I’m not taking actions to create a change. It’s like I’m trapped in a trap I created by overthinking and I just want to get out of it","Your habitual response to discomfort (anxiety, fear, doubt, etc. ) is AVOIDANCE, and the first step towards changing things would be to shift it towards ACCEPTANCE. 

&#x200B;

There are two things you'd nee to work on: bias towards action and raising self-efficacy. 

[Here's](https://backtosenses.com/procrastination-bias-towards-action-doing-overthinking/) a piece I wrote a while ago on the subject (as I was at a master level of overthinking)",meditate,"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of mental clutter, and that's something many of us can relate to. One thing that might help is setting aside a specific time each day for ""worry time."" During this time, allow yourself to think about all your concerns and doubts, but once the time is up, try to shift your focus to something else. This can help contain overthinking to a manageable part of your day.

Another approach is to start small. Pick one task or goal that feels achievable and break it down into even smaller steps. Focus on completing just one step at a time. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and build momentum. Also, consider practicing mindfulness or meditation. These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and learn to let them pass without getting stuck in them.

Remember, it's okay to feel stuck sometimes, but taking small, consistent actions can lead to big changes over time. You've got this!","Overthinking is like having too many browser tabs open - it drains your mental energy and makes everything slower. The key is to start closing those tabs through action.

Here's what works: Pick ONE small, concrete task. Not your life goals, not your five-year plan - just one tiny thing you can do in the next 5 minutes. Maybe it's sending that email you've been putting off, or organizing one drawer, or doing 5 pushups. The specific task doesn't matter as much as just doing it.

The ""two-minute rule"" is particularly effective for breaking out of overthinking. If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. No planning, no analyzing - just action. This builds momentum.

Another practical technique is time-boxing: Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on something. When thoughts start spiraling, gently redirect your focus back to the task. You don't have to figure everything out - you just have to focus on this one thing for 25 minutes.

Remember that action creates clarity, not the other way around. You won't think your way out of overthinking. Start small, stay concrete, and let the momentum build naturally. Your comfort zone will expand with each small step you take outside of it.

The fact that you're self-reflecting shows awareness - now it's time to channel that awareness into small, consistent actions. Start today, start small, but most importantly: start.","It sounds like you're really struggling with analysis paralysis, where overthinking is holding you back from taking action towards your goals. One strategy that might help is to set a timer for a short period, say 10-15 minutes, and during that time, focus on taking one small step towards your goal without allowing yourself to think about the potential outcomes or doubts. This can help build momentum and get you out of the comfort zone you mentioned. Additionally, try to reframe your self-reflection into actionable questions, such as ""what's the smallest action I can take today to move closer to my goal?"" or ""what's one thing I can do right now to make progress?"" By focusing on small, tangible actions, you can start to break down the barrier of overthinking and build confidence in your ability to take control of your life. Remember, it's not about making huge changes all at once, but about taking consistent, small steps towards your goals.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Overthinking is a productivity killer. It sounds like you're stuck in analysis paralysis, which is super common.

One thing that's helped me is to set a timer for 5-10 minutes and just brain dump everything that's swirling around in my head onto a piece of paper. Don't censor yourself, just write. Then, when the timer goes off, step away from it for a bit. Come back and see if you can identify the core issues that are causing the anxiety.

Once you've identified those core issues, try breaking down your goals into ridiculously small, manageable steps. Instead of ""write a book,"" think ""write one sentence."" The smaller the step, the less intimidating it becomes, and the easier it is to actually start. Momentum is key.

Also, remember that action precedes motivation. You're waiting for the perfect feeling to start, but it rarely comes. Just start *something*, anything, and the motivation will often follow. Good luck, you got this!

t3_v6gh32,[Need Advice] How do I become a doer?,"I like to daydream about all the wonderful projects and other things that I *could* be working on at any given moment, but still I never seem to be able to do anything to work toward my goals. I want to get into game development, make art, make music, learn a new language, and lose weight but I just can't seem to find the drive.

I'm paradoxically bored all the time despite the large amount of things I could be doing, nothing is ever fun for more than 30 minutes or so, and I find it extremely difficult to start doing anything at all even things that are supposed to be fun like video games.

I think I'm depressed as these are symptoms of depression if I'm not mistaken, but I'm already being treated for depression along with anxiety and possible ADHD, and nothing seems to be working. I tried ritalin and adderall because I thought I had ADHD, but neither seemed to really help. Maybe I just needed some supplemental treatment like exercise or something, but I found my situation to be much of the same. I've always felt like there was something wrong with me, but I've got to be capable of doing things, right?

I just don't know anymore. I don't even know if I'm in the right community, but I feel like I need discipline in my life so here I am... Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful day!",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're juggling a lot of interests, which is awesome, but it can also be overwhelming. One thing that might help is to start small and focus on just one project or goal at a time. Pick something that excites you the most and set a tiny, achievable goal related to it. For example, if it's game development, maybe start by dedicating just 10 minutes a day to learning a new tool or concept. 

Also, try to establish a routine. Even a simple one can help create a sense of structure and make it easier to get started. You mentioned exercise, and that's a great idea—it can boost your mood and energy levels. Maybe a short daily walk could be a good start.

Remember, it's okay to take things slow. Progress is progress, no matter how small. And don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider about how you're feeling; they might have additional insights or adjustments to your treatment that could help. You're definitely capable of doing things, and it's great that you're seeking ways to build discipline. Keep at it, and be kind to yourself along the way. You've got this!","Hey there - what you're describing sounds really familiar, and there's definitely hope for becoming more of a ""doer."" The key is to start incredibly small and build momentum gradually.

Instead of thinking about all those big goals at once (game dev, art, music, language learning, etc.), pick just ONE thing that interests you most right now. Let's say it's game development. Now, commit to working on it for just 5 minutes per day - that's it. The time is so short that your brain won't put up much resistance.

The real trick is showing up consistently. Those 5 minutes will often naturally turn into 15 or 30 once you get started, but if they don't, that's completely fine. The win is in showing up and doing the tiny commitment.

For the focus/boredom issues, try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. But honestly, even this might be too much at first. Start with 10-minute work periods if needed.

Something that helps a lot of people is having a dedicated space and time for working on their chosen activity. Maybe it's a specific corner of your room at 7pm each day. The routine itself becomes a trigger for action.

Remember that motivation follows action, not the other way around. You won't magically feel motivated one day - you have to start doing things, however small, and the motivation gradually builds from there.

Give this a shot for two weeks: One goal, 5 minutes per day, same time and place. Don't worry about the other goals for now. Once this becomes easier, you can slowly expand from there. The key is building that initial momentum with something so small it feels almost ridiculous to skip it.","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of motivation, focus, and possibly some underlying mental health factors that are making it tough to get started on your goals. First, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of discipline in achieving what you want, and for seeking help - that's a huge step. Given your situation, I'd suggest starting small, really small. Instead of trying to tackle all these big projects at once, pick one thing, like game development, and commit to doing just 10-15 minutes of work on it each day. Yes, you read that right, just 10-15 minutes. This can help build momentum and make it feel less overwhelming. Additionally, since you mentioned exercise didn't seem to help much, maybe try incorporating a different type of physical activity into your daily routine, like a short walk or some light stretching, to see if that helps increase your energy levels. It's also worth exploring other supplemental treatments or therapies with your healthcare provider, as sometimes it takes a combination of approaches to find what works best for you. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself - it's okay to not be okay, and it's great that you're already seeking treatment. The fact that you're here, looking for ways to improve, shows that you do have the capacity to make changes and work towards your goals. Keep in mind that progress might be slow, but it's still progress, and that's something to build on.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out and actively looking for solutions. It's definitely possible to break out of this cycle.

First, since you're already being treated for depression, anxiety, and potentially ADHD, it might be worth having another conversation with your doctor or therapist. Let them know that the current treatment isn't fully addressing the lack of motivation and difficulty starting tasks. Sometimes it takes tweaking the approach to find what works best for you.

As for the discipline aspect, it sounds like you might be overwhelming yourself with too many options. Trying to tackle game development, art, music, language learning, and weight loss all at once is a recipe for feeling paralyzed. Instead, try picking *one* thing to focus on for a set period, like a month.

Then, break that one thing down into ridiculously small, manageable steps. Want to learn a language? Commit to just 5 minutes of Duolingo a day. Want to make art? Start with a 5-minute sketch. The key is to make the initial barrier to entry as low as possible. Once you get started, you might find it easier to keep going.

Also, ditch the idea that everything has to be ""fun."" Discipline isn't about constant enjoyment; it's about doing what you need to do even when you don't feel like it. Focus on the feeling of accomplishment after completing a small task, even if it wasn't particularly thrilling. That sense of progress can be a powerful motivator.

Finally, be patient with yourself. Building discipline takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you slip up or have a bad day. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. You've got this!

t3_t0bf66,[need advice] I need to make her proud.,"so, my momma passed last week and my step dad said her last wishes were to make sure I was ok and to be able to take care of myself and I need to do this.

my sister cares and she's hard on me but ik it's bc she cares. but I don't think it's fair for her to expect me to have a plan just yet.

however, I always have ideas floating around in my head.

here are some facts:

- I have about 2 years worth of college credits under my belt towards a degree in social work. I don't think I want to go to school rn. hell, I don't know if I want to go back to school at all. maybe sometime in the future. I don't know if I want to be a social worker anymore either.

- according to my sister I can ""barely take care of myself"". I mean yes I live with mental illness but it doesn't mean I'm inept or incompetent. I just am not good at the important stuff like scheduling appts, taking meds on time, folding clothes, some hygiene stuff, etc. I mean I'm functional, but not to her standards.

- after the insurance payout, I'll be able to get a car so I'll have transportation in general.

- I'm getting a cat to maintain some level responsibility/routine as well as have a companion now that I'll most likely be alone in the house. 

- I'm pursuing a Google certificate to kind of dip my toe into the tech world. other than social work it's the only thing that seems interesting imo.

- I don't have a job. however, I have time.

My plans so far:
- stay in therapy
- keep cat alive
- learn to drive for real. I have a license but don't drive.
- get a job/save
- get certificate
- get a better job
- cut back on smoking (vaping) weed

idk what I'm doing. I feel like I've fried my brain. I've been high for the past year and I'm not bragging about that. it sucks. I have a rough idea of what I want to do but how do I find the motivation to do any of these things? I'm not sure that my ""plan"" is even a good one. 
 
I'm just so lost rn. I'm 22 and at a shitty ass crossroads. please feel free to ask any questions at all. thoughts?",,,"I'm really sorry to hear about your mom. It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's okay to feel lost. You've got a lot on your plate, but it seems like you have a solid starting point with your plans. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

1. **Small Steps**: Focus on one thing at a time. Maybe start with something manageable like learning to drive or cutting back on vaping. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Routine**: Establishing a daily routine can help with discipline. It doesn't have to be perfect, just consistent. Your cat can be a great part of this routine, giving you a reason to get up and take care of something every day.

3. **Therapy**: Staying in therapy is a great move. It can provide support and help you work through your feelings and challenges.

4. **Job and Certificate**: Consider looking for a part-time job that allows you to balance your time while you work on the Google certificate. This can give you some financial independence and structure.

5. **Support System**: Lean on your sister and friends. They care about you and can be a source of support and accountability.

Remember, it's okay not to have everything figured out right now. You're taking steps in the right direction, and that's what matters. Keep going, and be kind to yourself along the way.","First, I'm sorry about your mom. It's completely understandable that you need time to process everything, and your sister should give you some space to grieve before expecting a fully formed life plan.

That said, you've actually got a decent framework started here. Your list of goals is realistic and shows you're thinking about this seriously. The key is going to be breaking these down into smaller, manageable steps and building momentum gradually.

Start with the basics: Pick one small habit to build first, like taking your meds at the same time every day. Set an alarm, put the meds somewhere visible, and just focus on that for a week or two until it becomes automatic. Then add another small habit.

The cat is actually a smart idea - having a dependent creature can help create structure and routine. Use that responsibility to anchor other habits, like setting specific feeding times that align with when you want to wake up or go to bed.

For the weed situation - consider gradually reducing usage rather than stopping cold turkey. Maybe start by not smoking until after you've completed certain daily tasks, then slowly decrease from there.

The Google cert is a solid move. Tech jobs often care more about skills than degrees, and many are remote-friendly which could work well with managing mental health. Set aside specific times to work on it - even if it's just 30 minutes daily at first.

Your sister means well, but don't let her standards paralyze you. Focus on progress, not perfection. You don't need to transform overnight. Small, consistent steps forward will compound over time.

Pick one thing from your list to start with this week. Just one. Make it small and specific. What feels most manageable right now?","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed with figuring out your next steps, especially with the added weight of wanting to make your mom proud. First, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. You've been through a tough time with your mom's passing, and it's normal to feel lost.

It's great that you're recognizing areas where you'd like to improve, such as taking care of yourself and developing a routine. Getting a cat can be a wonderful way to start building responsibility and having a companion. Your plans, like staying in therapy, learning to drive, and pursuing the Google certificate, are all positive steps.

To find motivation, try breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, instead of ""get a job,"" start with ""update my resume"" or ""research job openings in my area."" This can make things feel less daunting and help you build momentum.

It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can. Your sister may have high standards, but that doesn't mean you need to meet them right now. Focus on making progress, not perfection.

Remember, you have time to figure things out, and it's okay to explore different paths. You don't have to have everything decided at 22. Take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance when you need it. What do you think is the smallest, most achievable task you can start with today to get yourself moving in a positive direction?","Hey, I'm really sorry for your loss. It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's completely understandable to feel lost and overwhelmed. It's okay not to have all the answers right away.

First off, your mom wanted you to be okay and take care of yourself. That doesn't mean you need a perfect five-year plan tomorrow. It means taking small steps each day. You've already got some good ideas in motion.

It's great you're staying in therapy. That's huge. And getting a cat can definitely help with routine and companionship. Don't underestimate the power of those little things.

About your sister's comments – it's tough when family is critical, even if it comes from a place of love. Focus on *your* standards for now, not hers. You mentioned struggling with scheduling, meds, etc. Try tackling one thing at a time. Set a daily alarm for your meds. Use a whiteboard or app to track appointments. Even folding one load of laundry a week is progress.

The Google certificate is a solid move. It's a low-pressure way to explore tech. As for motivation, sometimes it helps to break things down into tiny, manageable tasks. Instead of ""get certificate,"" think ""spend 30 minutes on the course today."" Small wins build momentum.

Cutting back on weed is a good goal, especially if you feel like it's been holding you back. Maybe start by setting specific limits (e.g., only after 8 pm) or swapping it out with another activity you enjoy.

Your plan doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be a starting point. Focus on those small, consistent actions. You're 22, you have time to figure things out. Be kind to yourself, and celebrate the small victories. You got this.

t3_wcjbh9,[Need Advice]I think I just realized that I'd rather just hoard a bunch of information rather than acting on any of it,"For years I've had this thing where I would always write down anything I'd like to do at a later date. Except I would almost never start those things but the lists would just keep growing. 

Lately I've been doing self discovery and self help and all that and I realized that for some reason I can only explore and save my options, but never actually action any of them...

Instead of picking one or two personal flaws and working on them I spent months just digging and prodding trying to figure out everything wrong with me.

Instead of picking one potential job or college degree or hobby, I gotta research every possible thing that interests me and then just sit on them doing nothing.

This shit even happens with movies. I paid for Netflix, Hulu, and Prime video at the same time, spent hours wish listing all the things I wanted to watch and then just sat on it because I didn't know where to start.

but yeah, im so focused on hoarding all these things that I wanna start or change but I never actually do anything about it. How can I fix this.","You need some little wins to start building confidence;

My psychologist said confidence isn’t natural, it’s a biproduct of doing. 

But you don’t need to do something big and dramatic or life changing, you just need to focus on what you want from the moment. 

My advice, find something that truly keeps you mindful and in the moment, and practice appreciating it and thank yourself and your body for being ok to be In the moment. 

For me, I pull weeds in my yard. It’s maybe 5-10 minutes of just air, weeds and my yard. Maybe my cat sometimes, but nothing steals this time from me. 

Since I’ve started this, I swear I can see clearly again lol I finally started the YouTube channel I launched almost a full year before, started back at the gym with all new approaches I had learned but never executed on, I’m utilizing a lot of my workplace tools I used to teach in my own freelancing and life now to help me manage everything. 

If you’re anything like me, you’ve learned everything you can and are probably proud of it all, but it adds to the noise. You gotta give yourself space to organize your thoughts and be able to utilize them","Fellow knowledge hoarder who struggles with inaction here. I finally pinpointed some of my problem: the idea that making a choice out of the multitudes I have “closes the door” on the rest of the options. Which can be true in certain cases but usually isn’t. 

To use a small example, tv shows. When you have an hour free to watch something, you see all the potential opening in front of you. Choosing one option removes all the potential except for one. And somehow my brain views that lost potential as something that could be a threat to our happiness. But it’s really not. I can definitely watch all the shows I want to watch, I just need to pick one quickly and go with it.

Basically, you just gotta start things sometimes. Sometimes it’s the wrong choice, and your time could have been spent better with a different choice. But doing something is always better than letting the inertia of inaction and the fear of making bad choices keep you from doing anything.","It sounds like you're in analysis paralysis mode, which is super common! A good way to break out of it is to start small and set some boundaries for yourself. Try picking just one thing from your list that excites you the most and commit to spending a short, fixed amount of time on it each day or week. It could be as little as 10 minutes. The key is to start building momentum. Also, consider setting a deadline for when you'll make a decision on something, like choosing a movie to watch or a hobby to try. This can help you move from planning to doing. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right away. Progress over perfection!","What you're describing is actually pretty common - getting caught in the ""research trap"" instead of taking action. The good news is that you've already taken the first step by recognizing this pattern.

Here's what you can do: Start ridiculously small. Pick ONE thing from your lists - literally just one - and commit to spending 5 minutes on it today. Not researching it, but actually doing it. Want to learn guitar? Spend 5 minutes holding it and strumming. Want to write? Write one paragraph. Want to watch something? Pick the first thing alphabetically and watch 5 minutes.

The key is to make the barrier to entry so low that it feels almost silly not to do it. Your brain will probably try to tell you that 5 minutes isn't worth it - that's the perfectionism talking. Ignore it. 5 minutes of actual doing is worth more than 5 hours of planning.

Once you've done your 5 minutes, you can stop. But often you'll find yourself wanting to continue, and that's great! The hardest part is usually just starting.

Remember: You don't need to know everything before you begin. You'll learn more from 5 minutes of doing than from 5 hours of research. Start small, start today, and most importantly - just start.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common phenomenon known as ""analysis paralysis"" - where the desire for more information and options prevents you from taking action. One strategy that might help is to set a ""good enough"" threshold for yourself, where you stop researching and start acting on something once you've reached a certain point of satisfaction. For example, instead of trying to research every possible job or college degree, give yourself a week to look into your top 3 options, and then commit to taking action on one of them. 

Another approach could be to focus on making ""imperfect"" starts - don't worry about choosing the perfect movie to watch or the perfect hobby to try, just pick something and start with it. You can always adjust course later if needed. It's also worth considering implementing a ""stop doing"" list, where you intentionally limit yourself to a certain number of options or activities, and eliminate anything that doesn't make the cut. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by too many choices. 

Lastly, try to reframe your thinking around the idea that it's okay to not have all the information, and that taking action is often the best way to learn and figure things out. You might be surprised at how much progress you can make once you start taking small steps towards your goals, rather than getting bogged down in research and planning.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're stuck in analysis paralysis, which is super common. You're gathering all this info, but the sheer volume is overwhelming and prevents you from actually *doing* anything.

Here's a thought: try the ""one small step"" approach. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick *one* thing from your list – the smallest, easiest one – and commit to doing just that. For example, with the movies, literally just pick one at random and watch 15 minutes of it. That's it. No pressure to finish it, just 15 minutes.

The key is to break things down into ridiculously small, manageable chunks. With your personal flaws, pick the one that annoys you *the most* and find *one* tiny action you can take to address it. Maybe it's reading one article about it, or talking to a friend.

The goal isn't to solve the problem immediately, but to build momentum and break the cycle of hoarding information. Once you've consistently done that one small thing for a week or two, add another small step. You'll be surprised how quickly those small steps add up. Good luck!

t3_13iiiex,[Need Advice] Went from extreme discipline to basically zero. Very unhappy with myself and my life.,I'm learning to play the guitar.,"Sounds like you’re experiencing burn out. You worked really hard, you still work really hard, so first thing first, give yourself some credit. 

I recommend sleeping a little bit more, force yourself to go to bed before 11 PM, you are not resting enough. Working for 12 hours is definitely too much; work is draining your energy. If you’re independent and have the opportunity to decide your time, i suggest you to stop working at most within 8 PM. 

If the place you live in is not enjoyable for you and you live alone, consider to move in a less expensive environment.
By now, your mental and physical health needs to be your number one priority. Find a hole in your routine to take a moment for sport, jogging, yoga, quick workout at the gym (45 min is enough), boxe (even at your home if you want to!), there are many choices. 

If you don’t have much time to cook, which is a super relaxing and fun hobby, you can try meal prep, so you can make healthier choices and don’t have to think about cooking everyday; you can prep during the weekend.

Getting back on track with discipline can be challenging, but it's definitely doable. Since you're learning to play the guitar, try setting small, achievable goals to rebuild your routine. Start with just 10-15 minutes of practice each day. Consistency is key, and even short sessions can make a big difference over time. Also, try to connect with other guitar learners or join a community online. Sharing progress and challenges with others can be really motivating. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs—what matters is getting back up and keeping at it. You've got this!","Learning guitar is a great goal, and it's completely normal for discipline to fluctuate - what matters is that you're ready to rebuild it. Start small by committing to just 10 minutes of practice each day at the same time, perhaps right after breakfast or before bed. The key is consistency over intensity. Once those 10 minutes become automatic (usually takes about 2-3 weeks), gradually increase the duration.

Set up your practice space so your guitar is easily visible and accessible - having to dig it out of a closet creates unnecessary friction. Track your practice sessions in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar or using a habit tracking app. This gives you a visual reminder of your progress and helps maintain momentum.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. If you miss a day, just pick up again the next day without beating yourself up. Focus on the process rather than results, and celebrate small wins like learning a new chord or completing your daily practice, no matter how brief.

What specific aspect of guitar playing interests you most? Having a clear, achievable goal (like learning a particular song) can help maintain motivation while you rebuild your discipline.","It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's great that you've acknowledged your dissatisfaction with your current situation. Learning to play the guitar is a fantastic hobby, but it can also be challenging, especially if you're trying to rebuild your discipline. One strategy that might help is to set extremely small, achievable goals for yourself each day, like practicing a single chord or scale for 5-10 minutes. This can help you build momentum and get back into the habit of regular practice. Additionally, try to focus on the process of learning and improving, rather than being too hard on yourself about not being where you want to be. Celebrate your tiny wins, and use those as motivation to keep moving forward. What's been the most challenging part of learning guitar for you so far, and how do you think you can apply that discipline to other areas of your life?","Hey, it happens! Going from one extreme to another is pretty common when you're trying to learn something new. Don't beat yourself up too much.

Since you're learning guitar, maybe try setting super small, achievable goals each day. Like, literally just ""hold the guitar for 5 minutes"" or ""play one chord perfectly."" The point is to build momentum and get back into the habit of practicing *something* every day. Even if it feels ridiculously easy, those small wins can help you break out of the zero discipline cycle.

Also, think about *why* you lost your discipline. Did you burn out? Get frustrated? Identifying the trigger can help you avoid it in the future. Maybe you were practicing too much, or maybe you weren't enjoying the songs you were learning. Adjust your approach to make it more sustainable and fun. Good luck!

Physically, consider setting a simple fitness goal. It could be as basic as a daily walk or a short workout routine. Exercise is a powerful way to boost your mood and build resilience.

Remember, it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable. It's part of being human. The key is learning how to balance them and not let them control you. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!","Hey man, going through a tough breakup is rough, but it's good that you're looking to grow from this experience. Being vulnerable and showing emotions isn't a weakness - it takes real strength to be open with someone. That said, I understand wanting to build better emotional regulation.

Start with small, consistent practices that help you develop mental toughness. Exercise is incredibly effective for this - even just 15 minutes of daily bodyweight exercises will build both physical and mental resilience. When you push through those last few pushups even when your arms are shaking, you're training your mind as much as your body.

For emotional control, meditation is your friend. Download a free app like Insight Timer and start with just 5 minutes each morning. It teaches you to observe your emotions without being controlled by them. Over time, you'll notice yourself responding to situations rather than reacting.

Keep a simple journal where you track your daily habits and reflect on your progress. Writing helps process emotions in a healthy way while keeping you focused on growth.

Remember that being reliable doesn't mean being emotionless - it means having the strength to handle emotions productively. Take it one day at a time, focus on these foundational habits, and you'll gradually build the mental toughness you're looking for.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your weaknesses and want to make a change, so kudos to you for taking the first step. Controlling your emotions and building mental toughness is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. One thing you could start with is developing a daily routine that includes physical exercise, meditation, or journaling - these activities can help you clear your mind, release tension, and gain clarity on your thoughts and feelings. It's also important to set small, achievable goals for yourself and work towards them, which can help build confidence and a sense of control. As for emotional vulnerability, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but learning to balance it with emotional regulation can be helpful. You might find it useful to read up on stoicism or emotional intelligence, as these topics can provide valuable insights on how to manage your emotions and develop a stronger sense of self. Remember that it's okay to feel lost, and it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to figure everything out right now. Just focus on making progress, and be kind to yourself along the way.","Hey man, sorry to hear you're going through a rough patch. Breakups are tough, especially when it's your first real love. It's good you recognized that staying ""friends"" wouldn't have been healthy for you.

As for getting more disciplined and in control of your emotions, it's a journey, not a switch you can flip. A good starting point is focusing on small, achievable goals. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once.

Think about one or two areas where you want to improve. Maybe it's hitting the gym a few times a week, learning a new skill, or even just consistently making your bed every morning. The key is consistency. When you start seeing yourself stick to these small commitments, it builds confidence and momentum.

Also, consider exploring mindfulness or meditation. Even just 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your emotions and how you react to them. There are tons of free apps and resources online to get you started.

Finally, don't be afraid to seek professional help if you're really struggling. A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your emotions and build healthier coping mechanisms. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help. You got this!

t3_pgfck7,"[Need Advice] I just can't stud, feeling so done.","I just can’t study*, feeling so done.



20M college student. Pursuing Btech IT, currently in my 5th sem...

&#x200B;

I wanted to increase my GPA so I decided to study hard, I made a plan, a schedule, and other stuff but I am just not able to do it. I am never able to follow my schedule.

&#x200B;

Certainly, I know I have to start small and Yes, I did start small but I still wasn't able to follow my plan and make a habit.

&#x200B;

What's the problem I am facing?

There is no one fixed problem, it's more like a mixture of problems. I'll try to explain.

Okay Again, What's the problem I am facing?

**(1/4)** I am just not confident in my abilities and it's sort of becomes the reason ""why to even study for a day when I am gonna ignore my studies for a week after that"".  I am not confident in myself, whenever I try to make a habit, I will do something for 1-2days and (relapse) wouldn't touch it for 1-2 weeks or keep putting them off tomorrow (procrastinate).

&#x200B;

**(2/4)** I simply don't think I'd be able to do it, I am talking about remembering 800 pages of theory. I don't think I can do that. 2 reasons:

1st) I simply don't see myself there, a person who would be able to remember 800 pages in 3 months, even by breaking the problem i.e. doing 2,3, or 5 pages per day I am not able to do it. I understand the concepts and stuff but I know myself and I know it is impossible for me to remember 800 pages.

2nd) Refer to point 4/4 kindly

&#x200B;

**(3/4)** Everyone around me thinks I am smart af...even when I am in the bottom 20 of my class in academics, I don't know why. It's maybe because I subconsciously project myself as a smart guy. It's just not me, I feel am deceiving people because I don't want them to find out that I am fucking dumb. I swear I feel like my IQ is going down rapidly, In school, I was a fast thinker but now I am just sluggish when it comes to quick decision making, It's like my thinking part of the brain is fogged.

&#x200B;

**(4/4)** Whenever I open the book and I see black and white pages with theory, IDK what the fuck happens but I feel like my whole energy has been drained.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

oh man, help will be deeply appreciated, I am in a new low...Thanks.","Have you tried the coursera learning how to learn course?

Spaced repetition software like Anki could also be a game changer if you stick with it","First of all download Study Bunny app. It's basically like a pomodoro app which notes down the exact number of hours you study everyday. That way you can see how many hours you studied each month & the time of the day when are the most productive. 

You said that you can't study everyday because you don't think you can maintain that habit for a long time. In that case, you need to tell yourself that you neither have to study everyday, nor you have to study the same number of hours everyday. You don't have to maintain a streak of the most number of days you studied at a stretch. 

What you need to do instead is to fix the number of chapters you are gonna read in one week and the number of hours you'll give in total for that entire week. 

That way your goal won't be to study, say, 4 hours a day for 7 days a week to complete 5 chapters in a week. Your goal will actually be something like studying 3 chapters for a total of 15 hours in one week. So someday you'll study for 4 hour, some day you'll study for 2, some day you'll study nothing at all but at the end of the week you would have studied for 15 hours in total. And you would have completed your goal of 3 chapters.

Sure this method might mean you maybe studying less than what you thought you could have. But atleast it won't give you anxiety and you'll atleast get something done rather than nothing done at all because you were feeling under confident. 

Focus on the sum total. Don't focus on the streak you maintained.

You said you just don't think you can study a book of 800 pages, no matter how small you break down your goals.
Here's where you have to lie to yourself. Tell yourself that you can. Wake up everyday and tell yourself that you are capable of completing a 800 page book if you broke it down into reasonable number of pages everyday. Tell yourself that you see no reason why that's impossible. You can do it and you will. You gotta ""Fake it till you make it"". Up until now your brain has been constantly telling you that you can't do it. And it didn't even bother to give you reason why. But you'll give it a reason OP. You will tell yourself that you believe in yourself and hence you'll complete that book of 800 pages. 


People think that you are smart but you think you aren't. You think maybe it's because you are subconsciously projecting that you are smart. Alright then, maybe ever since you left school for college, you really are not that smart anymore. You said so yourself, didn't you? 

But since these college mates still think that you are smart even though you think you aren't, even though you are just pretending to be smart then I guess maybe you are less smart than what they think you are but you are definitely more smart than you think you are. 

OP you just need to trick your mind into being your bitch. Stop letting it control you. You start controlling it. Tell it whatever it needs to hear to get it working for you. Trick it, lie to it, comfort it with truth, comfort it with lies & fake confidence. Do whatever you can but remember that you will talk to your mind and you won't let it talk back to you. Because the only thing your mind is telling you these days is that you aren't smart or capable enough to accomplish anything. But in the end it's only you who knows the truth.","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few things you might try:

1. **Break it Down Even More**: Instead of thinking about 800 pages, focus on just one page or even one paragraph at a time. Celebrate small wins to build confidence.

2. **Active Learning**: Try different study methods like summarizing what you read in your own words, teaching the material to someone else, or using flashcards. This can make studying more engaging and less draining.

3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Start with very achievable goals to build momentum. Even 10-15 minutes of focused study can be a good start. Gradually increase as you get more comfortable.

4. **Routine and Environment**: Create a study routine and find a study environment that minimizes distractions. Sometimes a change of scenery can help refresh your mind.

5. **Mindset Shift**: Remember, intelligence isn't fixed. It's okay to struggle; it doesn't define your worth or potential. Focus on progress, not perfection.

6. **Seek Support**: Talk to classmates or professors. Sometimes discussing your struggles can lead to new insights or study techniques.

Remember, building discipline takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!","Hey there. Your situation is really common among college students, especially in technical fields. Let's break this down into manageable pieces.

First, forget about the 800 pages for a moment. That number is overwhelming you before you even start. Instead, think of it as learning concepts and building understanding, not memorizing pages.

For the energy drain you feel when opening textbooks - try this: Start with just 25 minutes of focused study using the Pomodoro technique. Set a timer, put your phone in another room, and just work on understanding one small concept. After the 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. This helps prevent that overwhelming feeling of staring at endless pages.

About your confidence - success builds confidence, not the other way around. Start tracking small wins. Even if you only study for 25 minutes today, that's better than 0 minutes. Write it down. Tomorrow, try for two 25-minute sessions. Keep a log of these small victories.

For remembering content: Try active recall instead of passive reading. After each study session, close the book and write down everything you remember about what you just learned. Make connections to real-world applications or things you already know. This makes the material stick better than trying to memorize word-for-word.

The ""smart guy"" image - lots of smart people struggle academically. Intelligence and academic performance aren't the same thing. What matters is developing effective study habits, which is a skill anyone can learn.

Start today. Not with 800 pages, not with an ambitious schedule. Just one 25-minute session. Then tomorrow, do it again. Build from there. You've got this.","It sounds like you're facing a mix of self-doubt, overwhelm, and procrastination. First, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of focusing on remembering 800 pages, try to set daily or weekly targets for a specific number of pages or concepts you want to grasp. This will make the task less daunting and allow you to build momentum.

Regarding your confidence issue, it might help to reframe your thinking. Instead of ""why study if I'll just give up later,"" tell yourself ""I'll start with one day at a time, and see how far I can go."" Celebrate small wins, even if it's just studying for 30 minutes without getting distracted.

It's also interesting that you mention feeling like you're deceiving people by projecting yourself as smart. Maybe it's time to let go of that image and focus on your actual strengths and weaknesses. You don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to ask for help or admit when you're struggling.

Lastly, the feeling of energy drain when looking at theory pages might be due to burnout or lack of interest. Try to find ways to make studying more engaging, like creating concept maps, making flashcards, or discussing topics with classmates.

Remember, building discipline and habits takes time, and it's normal to face setbacks. Don't give up on your goals, but instead, focus on progress, not perfection. You got this, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey man, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's awesome that you're reaching out and trying to improve. It's super common to feel overwhelmed in college, especially with a demanding program like BTech IT.

First off, ditch the ""smart af"" pressure. It's okay to not be the top of the class, and honestly, everyone struggles sometimes. Comparing yourself to others is a motivation killer. Focus on your own progress.

About the 800 pages – that's a HUGE mental block. Instead of thinking about the whole thing, break it down even smaller than you are now. Forget 2-5 pages. Aim for *one paragraph*. Seriously. Just one. Read it, understand it, and then summarize it in your own words. Do that for one paragraph, and then stop. If you feel like doing another, great. If not, you still accomplished something. The key is consistency, not quantity, especially at the beginning.

Also, that ""energy drain"" when you see the textbook? Totally relatable. Try changing your study environment. Go to a coffee shop, the library, or even just a different room in your house. Experiment with what works. Maybe try studying with a friend, even if you're not working on the exact same thing. Just having someone else around can help with motivation.

Finally, about the confidence thing: celebrate the small wins. Did you read that one paragraph? Awesome! Did you make it to the library? Great! Acknowledge those little victories. They add up over time and build momentum. Don't beat yourself up for ""relapses."" Just get back on track as soon as you can. It's a marathon, not a sprint. You got this!

This is the bonus I will receiveto spend however I want if i complete a certain mission, if I don't then it rolls over to the next month. Essentially you are setting time aside to work on yourself, to pay yourself.","A man by the name of Andrew D. Huberman who is a Neuroscientist at the Standford school of medicine has a great podcast about this topic of creating goals, achieving goals, and how to reward/punish yourself according to those goals for the most productive results. I’ll try and find the episode title and number and edit it into this response.

[The Science of setting and achieving goals.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cO0BC9EEedrKhxQtjuo80?si=-cobxXi_Q-yNMRMs9AgIUw)","Great question! Rewarding yourself is a fantastic way to reinforce positive habits. The key is to choose rewards that are enjoyable but don't undermine your progress. For small goals, consider simple pleasures like taking a relaxing walk, enjoying a favorite snack, or watching an episode of a show you love. If you're working on a bigger habit, you might save up for something more substantial, like a new book or a day trip. The important thing is to make sure the reward feels special and is something you genuinely look forward to. Keep it balanced, and you'll find it helps maintain your motivation and discipline over time. Keep up the great work!","Great question about rewards! The key is choosing rewards that reinforce your positive habits rather than undermining them. For small achievements, try non-food rewards like:

Taking a relaxing bath, watching an episode of your favorite show, spending 30 minutes on a hobby you enjoy, buying that small item you've been eyeing, or simply taking a moment to write down your accomplishment in a progress journal.

The best rewards are proportional to the achievement and ideally don't work against your goals. For example, if you're trying to build better eating habits, rewarding yourself with junk food isn't ideal. Instead, maybe treat yourself to some new workout gear or a healthy cookbook you've wanted.

Remember that the satisfaction of achieving your goal is itself a reward - take time to really acknowledge your progress and feel good about following through. Over time, this internal satisfaction becomes more motivating than external rewards.

What kind of goals are you working on? That might help narrow down some specific reward ideas that would work well for your situation.","When it comes to rewarding yourself for achieving small goals, it's essential to strike a balance between motivation and not undermining your progress. Consider non-material rewards that still feel significant, like taking a relaxing bath, reading a chapter in a book you enjoy, or going for a walk outside. If you do choose a material reward, make it something small and related to your goal, like a new notebook if you've been working on writing habits. The key is to make the reward meaningful and enjoyable without breaking the bank or sabotaging your efforts. What kind of goal did you accomplish, by the way?","Hey! Rewarding yourself is key to building good habits. The best rewards are things that reinforce the positive behavior without derailing your progress. So, instead of something like a sugary treat after a workout, maybe try something like listening to your favorite song, spending 15 minutes reading a book you enjoy, or even just taking a moment to appreciate the accomplishment and visualize your future success. The reward should be proportional to the goal, and something you genuinely look forward to! Good luck!

What’s your instant way of falling asleep?,Nothing kills your ability to sleep faster than an urgent need to get to sleep.  Try your best to try and put that aside (I know how hard that can be!). I’ve had a lot of success with white noise over the years.  For me it’s rain.  Good luck and I hope you get a bit of sleep.,"Chamomile tea! Good bedtime habits like putting your phone away before bed. If I can't sleep, I do more work until I get tired and have to fall asleep. Sometimes this doesn't work due to worry, then you can try more soothing things like weighted blanket, night lamp, warm bath etc.","Hey there! Falling asleep when you're stressed about waking up soon can be tough. One trick is to focus on deep breathing—try inhaling slowly for 4 seconds, holding for 7, and exhaling for 8. This can help calm your mind and body. Also, make sure your room is as dark and quiet as possible. If you can't sleep, don't stress too much about it. Resting with your eyes closed can still be beneficial. For the future, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help signal to your body that it's time to wind down. Good luck, and hope you catch some Z's!","For immediate help tonight: Focus on relaxing your body completely. Start with your toes and work up to your head, consciously releasing tension in each muscle group. The 4-7-8 breathing technique also works well - inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Do this a few times while keeping your mind clear.

For the longer term though, you'll want to develop a proper sleep routine. The key is consistency - go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Start winding down 1-2 hours before bed by dimming lights and avoiding screens (the blue light really messes with your sleep hormones). Some people find white noise or nature sounds helpful too.

Exercise during the day also makes a huge difference in sleep quality, just not too close to bedtime. And watch your caffeine intake - try to cut it off by early afternoon.

When you do have a rough night like this one, sometimes it's better to just get up and do something calm like reading for 20 minutes, then try sleeping again. Lying there stressing about not sleeping usually makes it worse.

Don't worry too much about tonight - you'll get through tomorrow, and then you can focus on building better sleep habits going forward. One rough night won't derail you.","One technique that might help is the 4-7-8 breathing method, where you breathe in through your nose for a count of 4, hold it for 7, and then exhale through your mouth for 8 - this can really calm your mind and body. Additionally, trying to clear your mind by focusing on the sensation of the breath or a simple mantra can help quiet your thoughts. It's also worth considering setting up a consistent bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep, even if you're not used to waking up at 5am yet. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed or is there something specific that's keeping you awake tonight?","Hey, that sucks! Been there.

t3_12jron7,[Need Advice]How to stop late sleeping and develop regular sleeping pattern,"M28 currently working. I wish to stop bad sleeping habit and have a early sleeping habit. I wish to start working out early morning but I haven’t been able to go regularly. I live in a temperate zone it has been harder for me to change because I’m from tropics(maybe it’s a lie I’m telling myself)
I also had a history of bad sleeping habits, but now I have improved a bit (most nights I sleep 6.5 hours average) but I want to get better.
Suggest me some sleep habits or techniques that helped you.","I've finally managed to break my bad sleep habits. Here's how:

1. Start preparing for bed in advance of your bedtime. For example, if you want to go to bed at 10:30, set an alarm 1 hour to start doing bedtime routines. So at 9:30 you shower, brush teeth, start dimming/turning off lights, get stuff ready for tomorrow, etc.
2. Immediately stop using cellphone or computers at this alarm time as well. This period is your bedtime preparation phase and planning for tomorrow phase, nothing else.
3. Use settings in your smartphone which make the phone almost unusable at this cutoff time. Android has sleep routines. In this routine you can set it to automatically make the screen black and white and limit app usage. Use this. It's powerful. Then charge your phone at night far away from you in an ugly place. I put my phone on the floor at the other end of the room. Never on the nightstand.
4. Throughout the day, think ahead about your bedtime routine. Nothing happens spontaneously, including sleep. By thinking throughout the day, you mentally **prepare that your day will definitely end at this 9:30 cutoff and you must complete your tasks before then.**
5. Start at an easier bedtime and start pushing it back more and more as the habit gets stronger. Now I could make myself wake up at 5 AM easily daily if I wanted to just by changing when I start my bedtime prep routine.
6. Once you get the basics you can start to make the sleep routine enjoyable. Throw in things that are calming but not cellphone or computer related. Drink tea, write goals, write in a journal, etc within that hour.

If you find your mind racing while in bed, get out a pen and paper and write about the thoughts for a few minutes. Studies show writing on the issue to be calming and will silence the mental chatter.","1. Stop using gadgets in bed
2. Avoid blue light  for 1 hour after waking up and 1 hour before going to bed 
3. Follow the 25-minute rule. If you can't fall asleep within 25-minutes, get up and do something else (meditate, read a book)","Hey there! It sounds like you're on the right track by recognizing the need for change and already improving your sleep a bit. Here are a few tips that might help you develop a more regular sleep pattern:

1. **Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.

2. **Wind Down Routine**: Create a relaxing pre-sleep routine. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or doing some light stretching. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed as the blue light can interfere with your sleep.

3. **Limit Caffeine and Heavy Meals**: Try to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and keep heavy meals a few hours before bedtime.

4. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. This means a comfortable mattress, a cool room temperature, and minimal noise and light.

5. **Morning Light Exposure**: Get some natural light exposure in the morning. This can help reset your circadian rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep at night.

6. **Exercise Regularly**: Since you want to work out in the morning, try to stick with it. Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. It's great that you're already getting 6.5 hours of sleep on average, and with some tweaks, you'll likely see even more improvement. Good luck!","Getting into an early sleep routine is totally doable, even coming from a different climate zone. The key is to work backwards from when you want to wake up and create a consistent wind-down routine.

Since you want to work out in the morning, pick your ideal wake-up time and count back 7-8 hours - that's your target bedtime. The trick is to stick to this time even on weekends to keep your circadian rhythm stable.

Start by dimming lights and avoiding screens 1-2 hours before bed (or use blue light filters if you must). Make your bedroom as dark and cool as possible - this helps simulate the temperature drop that naturally triggers sleep. A white noise machine can also help if you're used to different ambient sounds from your previous location.

The morning routine is just as important. As soon as your alarm goes off, expose yourself to bright light - open curtains, turn on lights, or step outside. This helps reset your body clock. Even if you don't work out right away, getting that light exposure will help tremendously.

Don't try to change everything at once. Start by shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier every few days until you reach your target time. Your current 6.5 hours is a good foundation to build from. Remember that consistency matters more than perfection - it's better to maintain a regular schedule than to yo-yo between ""perfect"" days and late nights.","Hey, changing your sleep schedule can be tough, especially when you're used to a different environment. First, it's great that you've already improved your sleep to 6.5 hours a night - that's a good foundation to build on. To develop a regular sleeping pattern, I'd suggest starting by setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. Establishing a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to sleep - this could be something like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. 

Since you want to start working out in the morning, try setting your alarm for a realistic wake-up time and get some morning sunlight exposure as soon as you wake up - this can help regulate your circadian rhythms. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results, it takes time for your body to adjust to a new sleep schedule. You might also consider keeping a sleep diary to track your progress and identify any patterns or triggers that affect your sleep. Lastly, try to create a sleep-conducive environment - make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, and invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. Good luck, and don't give up - developing new habits takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run.","Hey, I get the struggle! Shifting sleep schedules is tough, especially with work and a climate change. Here's what's helped me:

First, consistency is key. Even on weekends, try to wake up and go to bed within an hour of your weekday schedule. It really helps regulate your body clock.

Second, light exposure. Since you're aiming for early workouts, try to get some sunlight first thing in the morning. It signals to your body that it's time to be awake. If it's still dark out, a light therapy lamp can help.

Third, wind-down routine. An hour before bed, dim the lights, put away screens, and do something relaxing like reading or taking a warm bath. Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.

Fourth, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just get back on track the next day. Small improvements consistently applied are way more effective than trying to make huge changes overnight.

Finally, regarding the climate thing, it's easy to find excuses. Maybe it *is* a factor, but don't let it be a roadblock. Focus on what you *can* control. Good luck!

This is currently what my brain thinks: ""it's not worth the struggle to do things immediately, it feels uncomfortable, so I'll just do nothing for a while until I get the motivation, because it feels better""

And I'm trying to think of a way to convince my brain that it's better to get it done asap but I'm a little lost. I noticed this is the reason I procrastinate a lot. I can't really think of a reason that'll convince my brain its worth powering through. Any advice?","Dont think so much. The thinking part is what kills the momentum. If you have to do something, just get it off your plate asap. Dont think and make lists . This is called cognitive loading. Playing out the scenario in your head and ultimately putting it in the todo pile instead of just doing that thing. Dont think, just do. Get into that habit.","Your mind will always argue to not do something that requires effort or makes you uncomfortable. The mind is good at making up stories and excuses. So no, you do not convince yourself. If you have decided to do something, you will do it. If it important, you still may have trouble doing it as you are listening to the BS story cooked up by your mind. Want to do something really? Count 5-4-3-2-1, and take the first step. Want to go jogging, stop BS excuses, do the count and wear your shoes. Want to get up early? Do the count, and throw the comforter / quilt / blanket aside, sit up and go splash water on your face..... As a wise man once said, ""Do or do not. There is no try.""

One thing that might help is to start small and build momentum. Try setting a timer for just 5 minutes and commit to working on the task for that short period. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it becomes easier to keep going. Also, consider the ""2-minute rule"" where if something takes less than 2 minutes to do, just do it immediately. This can help train your brain to act quickly and reduce the mental resistance. Lastly, remind yourself of the benefits of getting things done early, like reduced stress and more free time later. Over time, these small changes can help shift your mindset. Good luck!","Your brain is actually doing what brains are designed to do - avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. But here's the thing: that immediate comfort comes at the cost of much bigger discomfort later (stress, rushed work, missed opportunities).

Try reframing it this way: doing things immediately IS the comfortable choice. When you tackle something right away, you get to enjoy the rest of your time truly stress-free, knowing it's handled. That peace of mind is worth way more than the brief comfort of delay.

Start small. Next time you have a task, try the ""just 2 minutes"" approach. Tell yourself you'll work on it for just 2 minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll find it's not nearly as uncomfortable as your brain predicted, and you'll want to keep going. Even if you don't, that's 2 minutes of progress you didn't have before.

The motivation you're waiting for? It usually comes AFTER you start, not before. Action creates motivation, not the other way around. Each time you push through and do something immediately, you're training your brain to recognize that the discomfort is temporary but the rewards are lasting.

Remember: Future You is still You. By doing things now, you're basically giving a gift to yourself - the gift of not having to deal with it later when it's more urgent and stressful.","I think what you're describing is a pretty common struggle - our brains are wired to avoid discomfort, and procrastination can be a major obstacle. One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around the idea that it's not about feeling motivated, but about building discipline. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try telling yourself that you're going to take action for a set amount of time, say 25 minutes, and then you can take a break. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, you might want to consider identifying the underlying reasons why you're procrastinating - is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to address those specific issues. Lastly, remind yourself that the feeling of discomfort is usually temporary, and the sense of accomplishment you'll get from taking action will often outweigh the initial struggle.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like your brain is wired to seek comfort first, and anything that feels like a struggle gets pushed aside.

One thing that's helped me is to reframe ""doing things immediately"" as not a huge, overwhelming task, but as a series of tiny, almost ridiculously small steps. Like, if you need to do laundry, don't think ""I need to do all the laundry."" Think ""I need to gather the dirty clothes from the floor."" That's it. Once you've done that, the next step (starting the washing machine) feels a lot less daunting.

Also, try to focus on the *relief* you'll feel once the task is done, not the discomfort of starting. Visualize that feeling of accomplishment and freedom from having it hanging over your head. It's a much more powerful motivator than trying to argue with the ""comfort now"" part of your brain.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to procrastinate sometimes. The key is to not let it become a habit. When you catch yourself doing it, acknowledge it, and then try one of these strategies to get moving. Good luck!

t3_rn6x25,[Need Advice] - can’t get out of bed on weekends,I’ve always had a lot of trouble waking up and getting out of bed but I’m very functional during the week and I’m able to get to work on time. On the weekends however it’s not unusual for me to stay in bed until 1-2pm. I lack the willpower to get up and  be productive. Any advice to be productive on “free” days?,,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're doing great during the week, so let's build on that. One idea is to create a weekend morning routine that you actually look forward to. Start with something small and enjoyable, like making a special breakfast or going for a short walk. Setting a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, can help too. You might also try setting a goal for the day that excites you, whether it's a hobby or a project you've been wanting to tackle. Remember, it's okay to relax on weekends, but having a plan can make it easier to get moving. Good luck!","The key is to give yourself a compelling reason to get up on weekends, rather than relying on willpower alone. Start by setting just one enjoyable morning activity for Saturday - maybe getting your favorite coffee, going to a morning yoga class, or meeting a friend for breakfast. Having that commitment makes it much harder to stay in bed.

You might also want to keep your wake time relatively consistent with your workday schedule (maybe an hour later at most). Big shifts between weekday and weekend sleep schedules can make it harder for your body to maintain a rhythm. Try setting your alarm for 9am instead of sleeping until afternoon.

A simple trick that helps: put your phone/alarm across the room so you physically have to get up to turn it off. Once you're actually standing, it's easier to stay up. The first few weekends will feel tough but stick with it. After a few weeks of consistently getting up earlier, you'll likely find you have so much more time to do things you enjoy rather than losing half the day to sleep.

What specific morning activity would motivate you enough to get out of bed on weekends?","It's great that you're recognizing the difference in your weekday and weekend routines and wanting to make a change. One strategy that might help is to set a consistent wake-up time for yourself, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to get out of bed. Start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up at 10am, and then gradually work your way earlier if you find that you can handle it. Additionally, try to establish a morning routine that you enjoy, whether that's reading, exercising, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee in peace. Having something to look forward to can make it easier to get out of bed. It might also be helpful to plan out some activities or chores for your weekends ahead of time, so you have a sense of purpose and direction when you wake up. This can help you feel more motivated to get moving and make the most of your free days.","Hey, I totally get the weekend struggle. It's tough to switch gears when you finally have ""free"" time. Here's a thought: try setting a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, but make it a *slightly* later version of your weekday time. Like, if you get up at 7am during the week, try 8 or 8:30am on weekends.

Then, plan something small and enjoyable to do right away. Don't aim for a huge project, just something you actually *want* to do. Maybe it's making a nice coffee and reading a book, going for a short walk, or listening to your favorite music. The key is to make getting out of bed feel rewarding, not like a chore.

Also, prep the night before. Lay out your clothes, have your coffee ready to brew, or decide on your activity. That removes some of the decision fatigue in the morning and makes it easier to just get up and go. Good luck!

I used to be thin, but since starting a medication I gained 90 or so pounds. I’m off that medicine now, but the weight has stayed with me.

The problem is, I’m fat because I’m depressed and depressed because I’m fat. How do I kick myself into gear to lose weight while combatting depression? Any advice is greatly appreciated!","Walk until you aren’t sad each day. Get whatever you need to help you do this, podcasts, tv shows, music, vices, healthy beverages, whatever. You might walk four hours some days. But walk until you aren’t sad. Try this for a month, you will feel a little better every month",I think you'd have better luck in weight loss centered subs like r/loseit,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—taking that step is huge. Dealing with both weight and depression can feel overwhelming, but small, consistent changes can make a big difference over time. Start by setting very manageable goals. For example, try to incorporate a short daily walk, even if it's just around the block. This can help with both your mood and your weight. Also, focus on making one small change to your diet, like adding more veggies or cutting back on sugary drinks. Remember, it's not about perfection, but progress. Celebrate small victories and be kind to yourself along the way. If you can, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can provide support tailored to your situation. You've got this!","Breaking the cycle between depression and weight is tough, but it's absolutely possible to make progress on both fronts. The key is to start really small and build momentum gradually.

Pick one tiny health-related action you can do today. Maybe it's drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning, or taking a 5-minute walk around your block, or eating one piece of fruit. The specific action matters less than making it so small that it feels doable even on your worst days.

Once you've done that tiny action consistently for a week or two, add one more small thing. Maybe now you're doing that morning walk plus tracking your food intake, no changes required yet - just tracking. Then maybe you add some basic meal prep on Sundays.

The goal isn't to transform everything overnight. It's to prove to yourself that you can make positive changes, even when things feel overwhelming. Each small win builds confidence for the next step.

For managing both weight and depression, getting enough sleep is crucial. Try to establish a consistent bedtime, even if you can't sleep - just lying down at the same time helps regulate your body's rhythms.

Remember that progress isn't linear. There will be setbacks, and that's normal. What matters is getting back on track with those small actions, one day at a time. You've already taken a positive step by reaching out for advice - keep building on that momentum.","Losing weight can be tough, especially when dealing with depression - it's like you're facing two challenges at once. First, consider talking to your doctor or a therapist about your situation, they can offer valuable guidance and support. When it comes to getting started with weight loss, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like taking a short walk each day or doing a few push-ups in the morning. These tiny victories can help build momentum and boost your mood. It might also be helpful to focus on adding healthy habits rather than restricting certain foods - this can make the process feel less overwhelming. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to help.","Hey, that sounds really tough, but it's awesome you're reaching out and wanting to make a change. That's the first step!

It's a classic cycle, and breaking it takes time and patience. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Start super small. Seriously small. Like, commit to a 5-minute walk each day. That's it. No pressure to do more. The goal is just to build the habit of *doing something*.

Once that feels manageable, maybe add one healthy meal a day. Again, keep it simple. A piece of fruit instead of a sugary snack, or a slightly smaller portion at dinner.

The key is consistency, not intensity, especially when you're dealing with depression. Celebrate those small wins. Acknowledge that you showed up for yourself, even if it was just for those 5 minutes.

Also, if you're not already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and strategies for managing the depression itself, which will make everything else easier. Meds can be a real game changer too, if that's something you're open to exploring with a doctor.

You got this. One tiny step at a time. Be kind to yourself.

t3_ryyuv8,[Need advice] Terrible fatigue affecting my life,"Hello everyone. 

I'm 17 years old, and ever since I was 16 I have been suffering from pretty bad fatigue. I can't even describe how badly it affected my life. I used to go to school for 5 hours and go home fine, now I just ask my teacher for permission and I leave after around 3 hours, and when I get home I stay in bed all day not wanting to do anything at all. 

It's the main reason I did terribly in my exams. I'd sit at the desk and after just a minute I'd start yawning and having headaches. I'm in senior year rn and I need to start getting prepared. I also got a work-from-home job and since it requires sitting at the desk it isn't easy at all. I remember once I napped for one hour and used my computer for 15 minutes. After that I got so tired I went and slept for another hour.

Idk what's the cause. I sleep 10 hours at night + a 1 hour nap everyday. My parents keep insisting that it's just me being lazy and it's nothing serious medically. Any solution to this? It's really driving me mad.

Thanks for reading.","Wrong sub tbh. This amount of fatigue is a serious medical problem and won't be fixed with discipline.....

Thyroid levels 
Sleep apnea 
Anemia 
Vitamin D Deficiency 

Are the common causes but there can be about a million possible reasons even ranging into life threatening. Nag your parents to see a doctor.",Go see a doctor.,"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First off, it's important to rule out any medical issues, so if you haven't already, consider seeing a doctor to discuss your fatigue. Sometimes underlying health issues can cause extreme tiredness, and it's better to be safe.

In terms of building discipline and managing your energy, try to establish a consistent daily routine. This can help your body get into a rhythm. Make sure you're getting quality sleep—sometimes it's not just about the hours but the quality of rest. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed and try to keep your sleep schedule consistent, even on weekends.

For your work and study sessions, try the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep you focused and prevent burnout. Also, pay attention to your diet and hydration; sometimes fatigue can be linked to what we eat and drink.

Lastly, gentle exercise like walking or stretching can boost your energy levels. It might feel counterintuitive when you're tired, but it can really help. Hang in there, and remember that small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!","This sounds really challenging and definitely doesn't seem like typical laziness. The level of fatigue you're describing, especially the sudden change from being able to handle a full school day to struggling after 3 hours, suggests there might be an underlying health issue that needs addressing.

First step: Please try to see a doctor. This could be related to various treatable conditions like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, sleep disorders, or other medical conditions. Your symptoms are real and deserve proper medical attention, regardless of what others might think.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your energy:

Track your sleep patterns and fatigue levels in a simple diary. Note when you feel most tired and any patterns you notice. This information will be valuable for your doctor and might help you identify triggers.

Look at your diet - make sure you're getting enough protein, complex carbs, and staying hydrated. Sometimes excessive sugar or processed foods can contribute to energy crashes.

Try to get some light exercise, even just a 10-minute walk outside each day. It seems counterintuitive when you're tired, but gentle movement can actually help boost energy levels.

Break your work into smaller chunks. Instead of trying to power through long sessions, try 15-20 minute focused periods with short breaks. This might help you manage your work-from-home job more effectively.

Most importantly, don't blame yourself. This isn't about discipline - something's clearly changed in your body, and you need to find out what it is. Focus on getting proper medical help first, then you can work on building sustainable routines once you know what you're dealing with.","I can understand why you're frustrated with your situation, especially with the impact it's having on your school performance and new job. First, it's great that you're recognizing the need to address this issue, especially during your senior year. Given your symptoms, it might be helpful to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. It's possible that there's an underlying issue that needs attention, and a professional can provide guidance on whether your sleep patterns and lifestyle are contributing to your exhaustion.

In the meantime, you might want to try breaking down your day into smaller, manageable tasks to help conserve energy. For example, instead of trying to work for long stretches, take regular short breaks to stretch, move around, and rest your eyes. This can help reduce burnout and make your work-from-home job more sustainable. Additionally, consider establishing a consistent daily routine that includes time for physical activity, socializing, and relaxation - sometimes, fatigue can be exacerbated by a lack of balance in our lives.

It's also important to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about how you're feeling. It might be helpful to print out some information about chronic fatigue syndrome or other conditions that could be related to your symptoms, so they can understand that it's not just a matter of being ""lazy."" Remember, taking care of your physical and mental health is crucial, especially during this critical period in your life. Don't give up - there are likely solutions out there that can help you regain your energy and get back on track.","Hey, that sounds really rough, especially with senior year pressures piling on. Ten hours of sleep plus a nap and still feeling that wiped out definitely points to something more than just laziness, despite what your parents think.

First, seriously consider pushing back on your parents and seeing a doctor. Fatigue like that can be a symptom of a lot of things – vitamin deficiencies (like iron or vitamin D), thyroid issues, sleep disorders, or even something like mono. Getting a medical professional's opinion is the most important first step.

In the meantime, while you're waiting for a doctor's appointment (or even if your parents are resistant), try to implement some small, manageable changes. Don't try to overhaul everything at once, or you'll likely get overwhelmed.

Start with hydration. Dehydration can make you feel super tired. Aim for consistent water intake throughout the day. Next, look at your diet. Are you eating a lot of processed foods or sugary drinks? Try swapping those out for whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Even small changes can make a difference.

For your work-from-home job, break down your tasks into smaller chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have to work for hours,"" tell yourself ""I'm going to work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break to stretch or walk around."" The Pomodoro Technique can be really helpful for this. During your breaks, avoid screens if possible.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to struggle, especially when you're dealing with fatigue. Celebrate small wins and don't beat yourself up for the setbacks. Getting to the bottom of this will take time, but you've got this. Good luck!

First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but remember, it's never too late to start building the life you want. Here are a few steps that might help you get started:

1. **Set Small Goals**: Start with small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as making your bed every morning or setting aside 10 minutes a day to read. Small wins can build momentum and boost your confidence.

2. **Create a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, and include time for activities that are important to you.

3. **Limit Procrastination**: Identify one task you've been putting off and commit to working on it for just 5 minutes. Often, starting is the hardest part, and once you begin, you might find it easier to keep going.

4. **Practice Mindfulness**: Spend a few minutes each day practicing mindfulness or meditation. This can help you stay grounded and reduce anxiety, making it easier to focus on the present.

5. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a professional for support. Sometimes talking things through can provide clarity and motivation.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. You've got this!","Your situation is really common - many people feel stuck and overwhelmed when trying to make big life changes. The good news is that going from ""zero to 100"" doesn't happen overnight - it's built through small, consistent steps.

Start by picking just ONE small area to improve. It could be as simple as making your bed each morning or going for a 10-minute walk. The specific task matters less than building the habit of following through. This helps develop trust in yourself and shows that you can make positive changes.

For the overthinking and self-doubt - action is the antidote. Instead of getting caught up in thoughts about what you should do, pick something tiny and do it right now. Each small win builds momentum and confidence.

A practical way to start:
1. Tonight, write down ONE simple task for tomorrow
2. Do that task first thing after waking up
3. Repeat this daily for a week
4. After a week, add a second small task

Don't worry about going from 0 to 100 right away. Focus on going from 0 to 1, then 1 to 2, and so on. Progress compounds over time.

Remember that everyone starts somewhere. Your past circumstances don't define your future - your daily actions do. Start small, be consistent, and trust that positive changes will add up.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, which is totally understandable given your circumstances. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to go from ""zero to 100"" all at once, try breaking down your goals into tiny, manageable steps. What's one thing you could do today, or this week, that would make you feel like you're moving in the right direction? It could be something as simple as making a plan for the day, or taking a few minutes to exercise or meditate. 

It's also important to recognize that your past experiences don't define your potential for success - many people have overcome difficult circumstances to achieve their goals. You might consider seeking out resources or support systems that can help you build confidence and develop a clearer sense of direction - this could be a therapist, a mentor, or even just a supportive friend or family member. 

Lastly, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. You're taking the first step by recognizing that you want to make a change, and that takes a lot of courage. Don't give up on yourself - keep pushing forward, even if it's just in small ways, and see where it takes you.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and want to change is a huge first step. Going from zero to 100 isn't realistic, and trying to do that will probably just lead to more overwhelm. Think of it more like zero to one, then one to two, and so on.

Start small. Really small. Pick *one* thing you want to improve. Maybe it's getting out of bed at the same time every day, or spending 15 minutes reading, or going for a short walk. Don't worry about anything else right now, just focus on that one thing. Make it so easy you can't say no.

Once you've consistently done that one thing for a week or two, add another small habit. The key is consistency, not intensity. You're building momentum and trust in yourself.

As for the self-doubt and feeling lost, that's common when you're feeling stuck. As you start building these small wins, you'll likely find your confidence gradually increasing. You'll start to see that you *can* change things.

Also, consider journaling. Just writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and identify patterns. You might start to see what's really holding you back.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It takes time to build new habits and overcome negative thought patterns. Celebrate your small victories and don't beat yourself up when you slip up. Just get back on track the next day. You got this.

First off, it's great that you're reaching out and trying to make a change. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, but you've already got some good ideas in place. Going to the gym first thing is a solid plan since it helps with stress and sets a positive tone for the day. Try to stick with that routine for a week and see how it feels. 

When it comes to work, breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can make them feel less overwhelming. Set a timer for 25 minutes (like the Pomodoro Technique) and focus on just one task during that time. Afterward, take a 5-minute break. This can help you build momentum without feeling too pressured.

Also, don't be too hard on yourself for needing breaks or feeling stuck. It's okay to have off days. The key is to keep trying and adjusting your approach. Since you mentioned stress eating, having healthy snacks on hand might help, and chewing gum is a good idea too.

Here's what stands out: you're actually doing a lot of productive things (cleaning, chores, grooming) but they're becoming procrastination tools. The key is to flip your schedule around. Do the most important work when your willpower is highest - usually right after exercise when you're feeling energized and clear-headed.

Try this: After the gym and getting ready, set a timer for 25 minutes and just start working. Don't worry about doing it perfectly. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Repeat this 4 times, then take a longer break. This is called the Pomodoro Technique and it helps break through that initial resistance.

The stress eating and anxiety are your brain's way of seeking comfort when overwhelmed. Your idea about gum is smart. Also try keeping a water bottle at your desk and taking a sip whenever you feel the urge to snack.

Most importantly: forgive yourself for the past procrastination. You're not failing - you're learning what works for you. Start with small chunks of focused work time and build from there. The fact that you're actively working on this and seeking solutions shows you're on the right track.","It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and it's affecting your daily life and work. First, kudos to you for recognizing the patterns and having a therapist and doctor to support you - that takes a lot of courage. Your plan to change your morning routine by going to the gym first is a great idea, as exercise can really help with stress and anxiety. It's also good that you're acknowledging the importance of taking breaks when you're not making progress, rather than getting frustrated and giving up.

One thing that might help is to break down your work into smaller, manageable tasks, so it doesn't feel so overwhelming. Instead of thinking ""I have to do all this work,"" try focusing on one task at a time, and set a specific goal for what you want to accomplish in a certain timeframe. This can help make the work feel less daunting and more achievable.

It's also interesting that you mention eating as a form of procrastination - recognizing those habits is a big step. In addition to buying chewing gum, you might consider finding other healthy ways to cope with stress and anxiety, such as meditation, deep breathing, or a short walk outside.

Remember that it's okay to start small and make gradual changes. You don't have to overhaul your entire routine at once. Just focus on making one or two changes at a time, and see how they stick. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and get back on track. You've got this, and it's great that you're taking steps towards making positive changes in your life.","Hey, I've definitely been in similar spots, and it sucks, but it's also totally possible to break out of it. It sounds like you're already doing some good things, like seeing a therapist and having a plan.

First, be kind to yourself. You're clearly stressed and trying to cope. That said, your plan to hit the gym first thing is a great idea. Don't let the ""I need to work first"" voice win. The gym will likely reduce your anxiety and make you more productive overall. Think of it as an investment in your work, not a distraction.

Second, try to break down your work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have to do X huge project,"" think ""I need to work on X project for 25 minutes."" Use a Pomodoro timer (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break). It's way less daunting.

Third, about the eating/procrastination: the chewing gum is a good idea. Also, try to identify *why* you're eating. Is it boredom? Stress? Once you know the trigger, you can find alternative coping mechanisms. Maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or even just closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths.

Fourth, it's okay if the meds aren't working. Talk to your doctor about adjusting the dosage or trying something different. Don't just suffer in silence.

Finally, remember that progress isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days. Don't beat yourself up over the bad ones. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track the next day. You've got this!

t3_yi2qyd,[Need Advice] this is my first time being disciplined. And I'm not feeling good,"Before this , i was addicted to phone, didn't do anything all day. so yesterday i decided to change it

today, Only 2 hours have passed since i didn't touch phone or wasted any time. I'm trying to be productive.
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable. I don't want to do this anymore. But i will be disciplined today.

Any advice to stop being uncomfortable, uneasy feeling, heart palpitations?",Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. We need discomfort to change and grow.,"Contrary to what others have said: I think the feelings you're describing are concerning. Palpitations and unease are symptoms of panic attacks/ anxiety disorders among other things. I am in no way qualified to diagnose anyone of something, let alone based on a text, but I would highly recommend to get in touch with a therapist (if your circumstances allow it). Ask your parents for help if youre still young + have a good relationship to them. Some disorders make it considerably harder to lead a healthy, disciplined life and treatment (therapy) can make this journey so much easier.

When feeling uneasy and especially when getting palpitations regulate your breathing. Sit down if possible, breathe in, breathe out. Remember that the feelings will pass, as all feelings do. Palpitations can be scary, but they pass the fastest if you stay calm. A detail a doctor/ therapist might be interested in is whether the palpitations occur when you're active or when you're still (running/lying down etc.)","Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking the first step towards being more disciplined. It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable when you're breaking old habits and trying something new. Your brain is used to the dopamine hits from your phone, so it's reacting to the change. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Take it slow**: Instead of going cold turkey, try gradually reducing your phone time. Set specific times when you can check your phone, and slowly increase the intervals between those times.

2. **Find a distraction**: Engage in activities that you enjoy and that keep your mind occupied. Whether it's reading, going for a walk, or picking up a hobby, find something that can replace the time you used to spend on your phone.

3. **Practice mindfulness**: When you feel those uneasy feelings, take a few deep breaths and try to focus on the present moment. Mindfulness can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more grounded.

4. **Reward yourself**: Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. This can help reinforce the positive behavior and make the process more enjoyable.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to feel uncomfortable. You're doing great by sticking with it, and it will get easier with time. Keep pushing forward!","What you're experiencing is totally normal when making big changes to your habits. Those uncomfortable feelings are your brain adjusting to a new pattern - like muscles being sore after starting to exercise.

Instead of going cold turkey, try scaling back gradually. Set a timer for 30-minute focused work sessions with 5-minute phone breaks in between. This will help reduce that anxious feeling while still moving you toward your goals. As you get more comfortable, you can extend the work periods and shorten the breaks.

For the physical symptoms like heart palpitations, try some deep breathing exercises. Take 5 slow breaths, counting to 4 as you inhale and 4 as you exhale. This can help calm your nervous system when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Remember that building discipline is a marathon, not a sprint. Small consistent steps forward are much better than trying to change everything overnight and burning out. You've already shown great initiative by deciding to make this change - now give yourself permission to progress at a sustainable pace.

Keep going! The discomfort will decrease as your brain adapts to these new patterns.","It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable when you're making a significant change like this, especially after being used to a certain routine for so long. Your body and mind are essentially going through withdrawal from the constant dopamine hits you were getting from your phone. The fact that you've made it 2 hours without touching your phone is a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself for taking the first step. 

One thing that might help with the uneasy feeling and heart palpitations is to take some deep breaths and focus on the physical sensations in your body. Sometimes, our minds can get ahead of us and make us feel like we're struggling more than we actually are. Try to ground yourself in the present moment and remind yourself why you wanted to make this change in the first place. It's also a good idea to have a plan for how you want to use your time productively, so you can focus on that instead of feeling restless. 

Remember, it's okay to feel uncomfortable, and it doesn't mean you're failing or that you should give up. It just means your body is adjusting to a new way of being, and that takes time. You've got this, and you can make it through the rest of the day. Keep pushing forward, and I'm sure you'll start to feel more comfortable as you get into a rhythm.","Hey, congrats on taking the first step! It's totally normal to feel uncomfortable when you break old habits, especially something like phone use. Think of it like quitting sugar – your body craves what it's used to.

A couple of things that might help: First, don't go cold turkey *completely*. Maybe schedule specific phone breaks, like 15 minutes every few hours, so it's not a total deprivation. Second, focus on *replacing* the phone time with something engaging. What are you being productive *with*? If you're just sitting there ""not using your phone,"" it's gonna be tough. Find an activity you enjoy, even if it's just a little bit, and dive into that. The discomfort will fade as you get more absorbed. Finally, remember it's a process. Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Just get back on track. You got this!

t3_sunufa,[Need Advice] How to know if something's not right for you?,"I'm a 1st year architecture student and I want to quit. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time. I have never been properly diagnosed since Im afraid of people knowing my condition and also if I ever did, im afraid its like an admission that I have something I can never escape. Moving on to my question, Im on the 2nd semester of the academic year and Im really struggling to keep up with it especially with the mental state I have now. 

Whenever I can force my self to do study or do work, I find enjoying myself a little. But when the time comes and deadlines pile up I get overwhelmed and completely shut down. I got down to the point that i just wanted to dissappear and off myself multille times. Everytime I wake up l, I just feel emptier and emptier. Whenever I imagined doing this in future (in the case I ever graduate of course), i couldnt even see myself doing it. I really do love this course and was a the things that I was decisive on but Im doing a bad job now so I figured that I would a bad job in the future as well. I want to take a break but i cant because Im afraid I wluld get left behind. I also worry that even if I switch courses, everything would still be the same. I just wanted to pause time so I can figure things out without getting left behind. Please help me out on what I should do. Please.",,,"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First off, it's important to acknowledge that struggling with mental health is not a sign of weakness or failure. It's okay to seek help, and doing so can be a crucial step in finding a path forward that works for you.

When it comes to deciding if architecture is right for you, consider a few things. You mentioned that you enjoy it when you can focus, which is a good sign that there's genuine interest there. However, the pressure and your current mental state are making it hard to see a future in it. It might be helpful to talk to a counselor or therapist who can provide support and help you manage your anxiety and depression. Many universities offer mental health services, and they can be a great resource.

Taking a break doesn't mean you're getting left behind. Sometimes stepping back can give you the clarity you need to move forward. If you're worried about falling behind, maybe look into options like a reduced course load or taking a semester off to focus on your well-being. Remember, your health is the most important thing, and there are many paths to success.

Switching courses is a big decision, and it's okay to take time to explore what truly makes you happy. Try talking to professors or professionals in the field to get a better sense of what a career in architecture might look like. This might help you visualize your future more clearly.

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups. You're not alone in this, and having a support system can make a huge difference. Take care of yourself, and remember that it's okay to ask for help.","Hey there. First off, please know that what you're experiencing with depression and anxiety is completely valid, and seeking professional help isn't an admission of defeat - it's actually a strong step toward getting better. Many successful architects and professionals have dealt with similar challenges.

Your situation sounds less about architecture not being right for you, and more about needing support systems in place to handle the workload in a healthy way. The fact that you enjoy the work when you're able to focus on it is actually a really good sign.

Here's what I suggest: Start by breaking down your immediate concerns into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about your entire future career, focus on getting through this week. Set specific times for work, and more importantly, set specific times to rest. Architecture is intense, but sustainable work habits are crucial.

Consider talking to your academic advisor about your situation. Many universities offer academic accommodations and counseling services that can help you manage your course load without falling behind. You don't have to disclose everything, but letting them know you're struggling can open up options you might not know exist.

Taking a break isn't failing - sometimes it's exactly what you need to come back stronger. If you do decide to take a break, use that time purposefully to work on your mental health and develop better coping strategies. The field of architecture isn't going anywhere, and being in a better headspace will make you a better architect in the long run.

Remember: Your worth isn't determined by your productivity, and struggling now doesn't mean you'll struggle forever. Take it one day at a time, and please reach out to a counselor or mental health professional who can help you navigate this period.","It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about your path forward with architecture school. First, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with depression and anxiety, and I'm glad you're reaching out for support. It's understandable that you're worried about falling behind, but taking care of your mental health is crucial right now. 

Considering a break or switching courses might be a good idea, but before making any big decisions, have you thought about talking to a school counselor or a therapist about how you're feeling? They can help you explore your options and develop a plan that works for you. It's also worth looking into resources on campus that can support students with mental health conditions - you don't have to face this alone.

In terms of figuring out if architecture is really right for you, it might be helpful to take a step back and think about what specifically is making you feel overwhelmed. Is it the coursework, the time commitment, or something else? Are there aspects of the field that you still enjoy and feel passionate about? Reflecting on these questions can help you get clarity on what's not working for you and what you might need to change.

Remember, taking a break or switching courses doesn't mean you've failed or that you'll be left behind. It means you're prioritizing your well-being and taking the time to figure out what's best for you. And hey, it's okay to not have all the answers right now - just take things one step at a time and focus on getting the support you need.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to reach out like this. First off, please know that your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in struggling with these kinds of thoughts.

It sounds like the pressure of architecture school, combined with your mental health, is creating a really difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and questioning everything.

Here's a thought: instead of thinking about quitting entirely right now, could you explore some smaller, more manageable steps? Maybe start by talking to your university's counseling services. They can offer support and guidance, and it's confidential. You don't have to go through this alone.

Also, consider talking to an academic advisor. Explain your situation and see if there are options like reducing your course load, taking a leave of absence, or exploring different specializations within architecture that might be a better fit. Sometimes a small adjustment can make a big difference.

Regarding your fear of being ""left behind,"" remember that everyone's journey is different. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as your academic progress. A break or a change of pace might actually help you come back stronger and more focused.

Finally, about your fear that switching courses won't change anything: it's a valid concern, but it's also possible that a different environment or subject matter could be more stimulating and less stressful. Don't let that fear paralyze you. Explore your options, talk to people in other fields, and see if anything sparks your interest.

Take things one step at a time. Focus on getting the support you need, exploring your options, and making small, manageable changes. You've got this.

t3_ojhfp6,[Need Advice] Feeling sleepy all the time,"I'm practicing dopamine detox these days because its not like I just want to try, I simply need it. I'm a very distracted person which simply hampers my studies. I've started with common things like no social media, no random searching on the internet, no youtube, not using phone (just using twice, once in the morning and once at night just to check mails, read some good posts on reddit etc.), no music (I don't watch movies and shows that much so thats already in control). 

Problem is while I study or work on something else as well, I feel sleepy, a lot. This problem is concerning because I have a healthy diet, and sleep for atleast 6-7 hours at night (usually I go to bed around 12), yet....

Previously in my old routine, I used to just put on the headphones and listen to music while working. That used to keep my mind active. But now when I fully want to concentrate, without music or anything, I just can't. No doubt, I've improved a lot due to my new routine and practice but feeling sleepy is the issue. 

Any advice on how to get over this? I want to control it rather than letting it control me and sabotaging my studies or work.","You're going to get some great advice on this, but I'll offer up something that will sound bizarre, but hear me out: brush and floss your teeth. 

I was dealing with the same issue last year despite being a healthy person. Admittedly, I've never been great at brushing twice a day or flossing (I brushed once, in the morning, and NEVER flossed). However, after switching to a new dentist, it was discovered that I had a mild case of gingivitis (the dental professionals will need to correct my terminology).

Long story short, it was explained to me that my body uses energy to fight off the infection of gingivitis, constantly; and that chronic fatigue is a consequence. Here's an article that explains it better: [https://nancyshibadds.com/p/BLOG-36442-2017.4.20-Is-Gum-Disease-Draining-Your-Energy-p.asp#:\~:text=The%20gums%20are%20rich%20in,feel%20worn%20out%20and%20tired](https://nancyshibadds.com/p/BLOG-36442-2017.4.20-Is-Gum-Disease-Draining-Your-Energy-p.asp#:~:text=The%20gums%20are%20rich%20in,feel%20worn%20out%20and%20tired).

I now brush twice and floss daily without fail, and that's because of the energy spike I felt within two weeks of not being a gross dude.","I don't understand the reasoning behind getting rid of the music, especially if it apparently worked well for you. There is research out there that certain kinds of music can actually increase our focus. For me, something ambient and wallpaper-y is absolutely essential if I'm doing work that requires concentration.","It sounds like you're making some great strides with your dopamine detox, but the sleepiness is definitely a hurdle. Here are a few things you might try: 

1. **Adjust Your Sleep Schedule**: Even though you're getting 6-7 hours, you might need a bit more. Try going to bed earlier and see if that helps. Everyone's sleep needs are different, and sometimes just an extra hour can make a big difference.

2. **Take Short Breaks**: Implement the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help keep your mind fresh and prevent that sleepy feeling.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes, feeling sleepy can be a sign of dehydration. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.

4. **Natural Light and Fresh Air**: Try to study near a window or take short walks outside. Natural light and fresh air can be invigorating and help keep you alert.

5. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some light exercise into your routine. Even a quick 10-minute workout can boost your energy levels.

6. **Mindful Music**: If music helped you before, consider using instrumental or ambient music that won't distract you but can keep your mind engaged.

Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you. Keep experimenting with small changes until you find the right balance. Good luck!","Your sleepiness might actually be related to your sleep schedule rather than just the dopamine detox. While 6-7 hours can work for some people, most adults need 7-9 hours, and going to bed at midnight can throw off your natural circadian rhythm. Try shifting your bedtime earlier (like 10:30 PM) and aim for 8 hours of sleep consistently.

For staying alert while studying without music, there are several effective strategies you can try. Take short breaks every 45-50 minutes and do some light exercise - even just walking around the room or doing jumping jacks can help. Keep your study space well-lit and slightly cool. Staying hydrated is also crucial - sometimes what feels like sleepiness is actually mild dehydration.

You might also consider breaking up longer study sessions into smaller chunks with different activities. For example, alternate between reading, writing, and problem-solving. This variety can help maintain alertness without relying on external stimulation like music.

If you really miss the background noise, try white noise or nature sounds instead of music - they can provide ambient sound without the dopamine hit that comes from actual songs. You could gradually phase these out as you adjust to studying in silence.

Remember that it's normal to feel some fatigue while your brain adjusts to less stimulation. Give yourself at least a few weeks to adapt to this new routine. The sleepiness should improve as your body and mind adjust to the lower baseline of stimulation.","It's great that you're taking proactive steps with your dopamine detox and recognizing the challenges that come with it. The sleepiness you're experiencing could be due to a few factors, such as your brain adjusting to the lack of constant stimulation or possibly even a sign of mental fatigue from focusing intensely without breaks. One strategy you might consider is incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to help increase your energy levels and alertness. Additionally, try breaking down your study sessions into shorter intervals with scheduled breaks in between, allowing yourself time to rest and recharge. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique and can be really helpful in maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. It might also be worth experimenting with your sleep schedule, trying to go to bed a bit earlier to see if that improves the quality of your sleep and subsequently your alertness during the day. Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you, so don't be afraid to tweak your routine as needed until you find what helps you stay focused and energized.","Hey, it sounds like you're making some solid progress with the dopamine detox! It's awesome that you're recognizing the need to cut back on distractions. Feeling sleepy while studying after making these changes is a pretty common issue, so don't get discouraged.

Since you've cut out music, your brain is probably missing that stimulation. Instead of going back to music, maybe try incorporating other ways to keep yourself alert. Have you considered things like:

*   **Short breaks with physical activity?** Even a quick walk or some jumping jacks can make a difference.
*   **Adjusting your study environment?** Make sure you have good lighting and a comfortable but not *too* comfortable chair. A slightly cooler room temperature can also help.
*   **Trying different study techniques?** Maybe the way you're studying is just boring you. Experiment with active recall, spaced repetition, or the Feynman technique.
*   **Hydration and snacks?** Dehydration can cause fatigue, and a healthy snack can provide a quick energy boost. Think fruits, nuts, or yogurt.
*   **Timing?** Maybe the time you study is the problem. Try studying at different times of the day when you feel more alert.

Also, 6-7 hours of sleep might not be enough for you. Everyone's different. Experiment with getting closer to 8 hours to see if that helps. And make sure that sleep is quality sleep – a dark, quiet room, and no screens before bed.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It takes time for your brain to adjust to a new routine. Keep experimenting and you'll find what works best for you. Good luck!

I'm thinking about 1,000 other things at once which prevents me from focusing on the task at hand or simply making me uninterested in starting it. Anything from reading a book to working out seem to have this extra hurdle because my mind is cluttered. This is primarily due to my job and my special needs child. Two things that constantly have me worrying about one thing or another. I'm not even trying to figure out a way to worry less, I just want to forget about worrying when I need to concentrate and not get distracted.",,,"It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and it's understandable that your mind is constantly racing. One technique that might help is mindfulness meditation. It can train your brain to focus on the present moment, which can be really useful when you're trying to concentrate on a task. Even just a few minutes a day can make a difference. Another approach is to create a ""worry time"" for yourself. Set aside a specific time each day to think about your worries, and when they pop up outside of that time, remind yourself that you'll deal with them later. This can help you compartmentalize and focus on the task at hand. Lastly, try to establish a routine for your tasks. When you have a set routine, it can be easier to slip into ""focus mode"" because your brain knows what to expect. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Good luck!","Having a busy mind is totally normal with everything you're juggling, especially with work stress and caring for a special needs child. One effective technique you might find helpful is the ""brain dump"" - take 10 minutes before your focused time to write down everything that's on your mind. Getting those thoughts onto paper can help clear mental space.

For the actual focusing part, start with short intervals. Set a timer for just 15 minutes where you commit to only doing one thing. When worries pop up during this time, acknowledge them briefly and tell yourself ""I'll think about this during my next worry time"" - then return to your task. It's like training a muscle - you get better with practice.

Meditation can really help too, but not the ""clear your mind completely"" kind. Instead, try focusing on your breath for just 5 minutes. When thoughts come (and they will), practice gently returning your attention to breathing. This builds the mental skill of choosing where to direct your focus.

Remember that the goal isn't to never worry - it's to create dedicated spaces for both worry and focus. Start small, be patient with yourself, and gradually build up your focusing periods as it gets easier.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot on your plate and it's affecting your ability to focus. One strategy that might help is to set aside a specific ""worry time"" each day, where you allow yourself to think about all the things that are on your mind. This could be 10-15 minutes in the morning or evening, and during this time, you write down all your concerns and thoughts. Then, when you need to focus on a task, remind yourself that you've already allocated time to worry and it's not the time for it now. This can help you mentally compartmentalize and give you permission to push those thoughts aside temporarily. Additionally, try using the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay on track and avoid getting overwhelmed by your thoughts. It might also be helpful to establish a pre-task routine that signals to your brain that it's time to focus, such as taking a few deep breaths, putting on a specific playlist, or doing some quick stretching exercises. Remember, it's not about eliminating your worries entirely, but about learning to manage them and create space for focus when you need it.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of a cluttered mind making it hard to focus. It's tough when you've got a lot on your plate. A couple of things that have helped me might be worth trying.

First, try a ""brain dump."" Before you start a task, take 5-10 minutes to just write down everything that's swirling around in your head. Don't censor yourself, just get it all out on paper (or a notes app). Sometimes just seeing it written down helps quiet the mental chatter.

Second, look into timeboxing or the Pomodoro Technique. Set a timer for a focused work period (like 25 minutes) and commit to only working on that one task during that time. When the timer goes off, take a short break. Knowing you only have to focus for a short, defined period can make it less daunting. During the focused time, if a distracting thought pops up, quickly jot it down on a notepad and promise yourself you'll address it later (during your break or after the work session). This helps you acknowledge the thought without derailing your focus. Good luck!

t3_q0nupo,[Need advice] I'm only living life for the next weekend,"I work a corporate 9 - 5 job, but because of covid and WFH, it's been more of a 9 - 9 kinda deal. I'll not get too much into it but I'm miserable during the weekdays. I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - 

Monday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. 

I want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. 

My current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.

How do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?","I personally don't think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.

I can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference","You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).","Hey there!

1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each day. This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.

2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.

3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there's a way to manage it better. It's important to have time for yourself outside of work.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.

5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.

6. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies to manage stress and improve your mental health.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You're taking a positive step by seeking advice, and that's a great start!","First off, working 12-hour days while WFH isn't sustainable - no wonder you're living for the weekends. This isn't what the next 35-40 years needs to look like, and there are several ways to make positive changes.

Start by setting firm boundaries at work. Block your calendar for breaks, log off at a consistent time, and communicate your availability clearly to colleagues. Your mental health and performance will both improve with better work-life balance.

Instead of viewing weekdays as something to ""get through,"" try building small things to look forward to throughout the week. Maybe it's a Monday evening hobby class, Wednesday lunch with a friend, or Thursday morning workout. These anchor points make weekdays more meaningful and break up the monotony.

For the food and sleep issues - they're connected to your current lifestyle. When we're stressed and unfulfilled during the week, we tend to seek comfort in food and sleep. Rather than fighting your body to get up, try going to bed earlier and establishing a proper morning routine. Even 15 minutes of morning activity (stretching, brief walk, reading) can shift your mindset for the day ahead.

Consider finding a physical activity you enjoy and scheduling it 2-3 times during the week. Exercise helps regulate mood, sleep, and eating patterns, plus gives you something productive to focus on besides work.

The goal isn't to make weekdays as exciting as weekends, but to create a sustainable rhythm where each day has its own value. Start with one small change this week - whether that's setting a work boundary, adding a weekday activity, or establishing a morning routine. Build from there gradually.

Remember that feeling stuck isn't the same as being stuck. You have more control over your daily experience than it might feel like right now.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in a cycle of just trying to survive the weekdays and then overdoing it on the weekends. First, I want to acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to make a change - that's a huge step. One thing that might help is to try to find small things to look forward to during the week, even if it's just something as simple as a favorite lunch or a short walk outside during your break. This can help break up the monotony of the weekdays and give you something to focus on besides just counting down to Friday. 

It might also be helpful to set some boundaries around your work hours, since you mentioned you're working 9-9 and feeling overwhelmed. Could you try setting a specific ""shutdown"" time for work each day, and then do something you enjoy in the evening to signal to yourself that work is over? This could be reading, drawing, or anything else that helps you relax and feel like you're not still ""on the clock"".

In terms of respecting each day equally, it might be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than always looking ahead to the weekend. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can help with this. It's also worth considering what specific things are making your weekdays feel so boring or unfulfilling - is it the work itself, the lack of social interaction, something else? Once you identify what's missing, you might be able to find ways to address those needs and make the weekdays more enjoyable.

Lastly, it's great that you're aware of how your current habits are affecting your mental and physical health. Have you considered seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of these issues? They might be able to provide additional guidance and support as you try to make these changes. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Just start with small, manageable changes and see how they stick.","Hey, I hear you. That ""living for the weekend"" cycle can be brutal, especially when work is draining. It sounds like you're stuck in a rut, but definitely not an unfixable one.

First, about accepting the next 35-40 years... don't! That's a recipe for misery. Instead of thinking of it as one long, monotonous stretch, break it down. What small, achievable goals can you set for the next month, the next quarter, the next year? These don't have to be huge career leaps, but things that add meaning and enjoyment to your life *outside* of work. Maybe it's learning a new skill, exploring a hobby, or volunteering.

Second, tackle the weekday misery. Since you're WFH, can you carve out specific ""work hours"" and stick to them? Even if it means shutting down your computer at 5 or 6 pm, even if you haven't finished everything. It's about setting boundaries. Also, try to incorporate small joys into your weekdays. A walk during lunch, listening to a podcast while you work, or even just making a really good cup of coffee.

Third, address the food coping mechanism. This is tough, but awareness is the first step. Instead of reaching for food when you're stressed or sad, try to identify the trigger and find a healthier alternative. Maybe it's calling a friend, doing some light exercise, or practicing mindfulness. Start small, like replacing one unhealthy snack a day with something better.

Finally, the sleep inertia. Instead of just lying there, try to get some sunlight as soon as you wake up. Open the blinds, go for a short walk, or even just sit by a window. The light helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

It's all about small, consistent changes. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one or two things to focus on, and build from there. You got this!

t3_oh80br,[need advice] I struggle to do anything on my day off,"I have one day a week that is set aside solely for me, no social plans, no errands, and also it’s the only day I don’t have any structure (I have other days off that I do errands/see friends etc). I wanted this day to work on my art, writing, and side hustle business, which are all things I love to do. But whenever this day comes around I feel depressed, have a hard time doing much or finding structure. I have ADHD and have struggled on/off with high functioning depression. I have a therapist and for the most part my life feels good, but I really want to figure out how to get disciplined and motivated with my art and creative side. Does anyone relate and/ or have advice for me?",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut with your free day, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of planning to tackle everything, pick one small task to start with. It could be as simple as sketching for 10 minutes or writing a paragraph. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Create a Loose Schedule**: While you want this day to be free, having a loose plan can help. Maybe set a time block for each activity you want to do, but keep it flexible. This way, you have some structure without feeling constrained.

3. **Incorporate Breaks**: Allow yourself breaks to avoid burnout. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work, 5-minute break) to keep your energy up.

4. **Environment Matters**: Sometimes a change of scenery can spark creativity. Try working in a different room, or even outside if possible.

5. **Accountability Partner**: Share your goals with a friend or online community. Sometimes knowing someone else is aware of your plans can motivate you to follow through.

6. **Celebrate Progress**: At the end of the day, reflect on what you accomplished, no matter how small. Celebrate those wins to reinforce positive feelings about your creative work.

Remember, it's okay to have off days, and progress isn't always linear. Keep experimenting with what works best for you. Good luck!","Having a completely unstructured day can actually make it harder to be productive, especially with ADHD. The lack of external structure means you have to create it yourself, which can feel overwhelming. 

Here's what's worked for many people in similar situations: Start by creating a loose routine for your creative day. Not a rigid schedule, but a general flow. For example, maybe you start with a morning walk to transition into ""creative mode,"" then spend 2-3 hours on art, take a proper lunch break, and dedicate the afternoon to writing or business tasks.

The key is making this routine flexible enough that it doesn't feel constraining, but structured enough to prevent decision paralysis. You might also try working in focused 25-minute blocks (Pomodoro technique) since this can make starting feel less daunting.

Another approach is to pick just ONE creative activity to focus on each week. Instead of trying to juggle art, writing, and business all in one day, rotate your focus. This week might be an art day, next week a writing day, etc. This can help reduce the mental load of task-switching.

Remember that motivation usually follows action, not the other way around. Sometimes you just need to start with something small - even just setting up your art supplies or opening your writing document - and the motivation will build from there.","I totally understand where you're coming from - having a day with no structure can be both a blessing and a curse. Given your ADHD and history with depression, it's great that you're acknowledging the challenges you face and seeking ways to improve. One strategy that might help is to create a gentle, flexible schedule for your day off, with small, achievable goals related to your art, writing, or side hustle. This could be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to sketching, or an hour to writing without any distractions. Having a rough outline can provide a sense of direction without feeling overwhelming. Additionally, consider starting with tiny habits that bring you joy, like freewriting or doodling, to help build momentum and get your creative juices flowing. It might also be helpful to identify specific triggers for your depression on this day - is it the lack of accountability, the pressure to be productive, or something else? Understanding these underlying factors can help you develop targeted strategies to overcome them. Remember, discipline and motivation are muscles that can be developed over time with patience, kindness, and consistency. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't meet your own expectations - you're taking steps towards nurturing your creative side, and that's something to be proud of.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That unstructured day can be a real double-edged sword. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to make it *the* productive day, and that can backfire.

Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, less intimidating chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to work on my art all day,"" try setting a timer for just 20 minutes and telling yourself you'll only work on it for that long. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going. If not, that's okay too! You still accomplished something.

Also, consider planning the *night before*. Decide exactly what you'll work on and for how long. This can help combat that feeling of being overwhelmed by too much free time. Even something as simple as ""10:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Sketching"" can make a difference.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay if some days are more productive than others. The important thing is to keep showing up and trying. Maybe reframe it as a ""creative exploration day"" instead of a ""productivity day"" to take some of the pressure off. Good luck!

t3_yexynj,[Need advice] I've been escaping reality for the last 7 months,"Not completely. There have been days and nights when I've had to face my reality. But it's so jarringly terrible that I always reverted to escapism.
Escapism is reading romance novels, watching Netflix, scrolling Twitter and Reddit, trying to find new friends, trying to hold on boys who don't show enough interest back, sleeping excessively, eating excessively, going out.
Reality is a big fucking exam I have to give, the weight I have to lose, a toxic family, an inability to make a schedule and stick to it (either due to personal reasons or because college is extremely chaotic and something or the other keeps getting in the way), feeling lonely and having no special person in my life, feeling disappointed by my friends and reliving past traumas.
I know a lot of this can be considered as excuses but for someone living this life, they're genuine reasons. I am trying. I really am.
I just feel lost.
I know you don't know my full story or much context, but please any and all help/advice is welcome.","Stop doing what's not working. Take responsibility for your life and actions.

Have a goal. Make a plan. Break it into small steps. Take action on small steps to reach your goal. Be disciplined a d consistent. 

Delete Netflux and Twitter and Reddit if need be. Orvlimit it to max 30 minutes a day. 

A marathon is run by taking small steps. And starts with making a decision and putting on your running shoes.

Your studying goals, break into 20 parts. Every week focus on doing 2-3 parts of it. This will give you measurable progress.

Suggest read Deep Work by Cal Newport. It is a great study guide for students. Also suggest Awaken the giant within and Unlimited power. Both by Anthony Robbins. They have great practical advise and psychological insights to help you do better. Buy online, borrow from the library or download a free pdf from pdfdrive dot net. 

You can do it.","sounds like you're exhausting yourself doing a lot of things you don't enjoy; that's why you're struggling so hard and trying to escape reality. you're tired and depressed because you're in constant battle with yourself... there's a part of you screaming and clawing to be uncaged, stop fighting with it; it's yourself, you crave a relationship because you don't feel whole due to rejecting and casting away parts of yourself.

real talk, ask Jesus to help you out in understanding yourself and in being your true authentic self.

once you learn to be entirely honest with yourself, accept yourself, and trust your own will; you'll start to find inner peace. with a sated spirit and at ease mind, you will then have the energy and focus to do the things you know you actually want to do and it'll never feel like work.","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. First off, give yourself some credit for recognizing the need for change and reaching out for advice. That's a big step.

Let's tackle this one piece at a time. Start small. Pick one area to focus on, like your exam or creating a simple daily routine. For the exam, break your study material into manageable chunks and set a timer for short, focused study sessions. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and make progress more visible.

For building a routine, try setting a consistent wake-up time and plan just one or two key tasks for the day. This can help create a sense of structure without feeling too restrictive. Remember, it's okay if things don't go perfectly—progress over perfection.

As for the loneliness and toxic family situation, consider reaching out to a counselor or support group at your college. Sometimes just talking things out with someone neutral can provide relief and new perspectives.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself for using escapism. It's a common way to cope, but try to balance it with activities that genuinely recharge you, like a walk outside or a hobby you enjoy.

You're not alone in this, and taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Keep going, and be kind to yourself along the way. You've got this!","First off - you're not alone in using escapism to cope with overwhelming circumstances. The fact that you recognize these patterns and are reaching out for help shows self-awareness and a genuine desire to change.

Let's start small. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick ONE area to focus on for the next week. Given your upcoming exam, that might be a good place to start. Set aside just 30 minutes each day for focused study - no phone, no distractions. Use the Pomodoro technique if it helps (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break).

For the schedule challenges with chaotic college life, try working backwards. Rather than creating a rigid hour-by-hour plan, identify your non-negotiables for each day (classes, exam prep, basic self-care) and build around those. Keep it flexible enough to accommodate unexpected changes.

The escapism activities aren't inherently bad - they're coping mechanisms. Instead of eliminating them completely, try setting boundaries. Maybe allow yourself one episode of Netflix as a reward after completing your study session, or set a 30-minute timer for social media scrolling.

Regarding family and relationship struggles - these are significant challenges that can't be solved overnight. Consider talking to your college's counseling services. They often provide free or low-cost support and can help develop healthier coping strategies.

Remember that building discipline isn't about perfection - it's about progress. Start with small, manageable changes and build from there. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging what needs to change. Now take one more small step forward.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stressors in your life, and escapism has become a coping mechanism for you. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to take breaks and step away from reality sometimes - it's not healthy to constantly face stressful situations without any relief. However, it's great that you're recognizing the need to balance escapism with facing your reality. 

One potential strategy could be to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick one area where you'd like to see improvement, like studying for your exam or creating a schedule. Set tiny, achievable goals for yourself, and reward yourself when you reach them. This can help build momentum and confidence. It might also be helpful to identify specific times of the day or week where you can allow yourself to engage in escapism, so it doesn't take over your entire life.

Regarding your toxic family and past traumas, it might be worth considering seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with guidance and tools to navigate these complex issues. Additionally, there are many online resources and communities available that focus on building healthy habits, productivity, and mental wellness - you might find it helpful to connect with others who are going through similar struggles.

Remember that developing discipline and new habits takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help, so try to be kind to yourself and celebrate your small wins along the way.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling lost and resorting to escapism. It's good that you're aware of it and want to make a change.

Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, maybe focus on one small, manageable thing. Since you mentioned the big exam, could you dedicate just 15-20 minutes a day to studying? Even if it feels insignificant, consistency is key. Break down the material into smaller, less daunting chunks.

For the weight loss, could you swap one sugary drink for water each day, or take a short walk? Small changes add up.

Regarding the schedule, instead of trying to create a rigid plan that's easily disrupted, try time blocking. Allocate chunks of time for studying, self-care, etc., but be flexible with the specific tasks within those blocks.

As for the other stuff, it's tougher, but acknowledging those feelings is a start. Maybe explore journaling or finding a therapist to help process the past traumas and navigate the toxic family situation. Even a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation can help ground you.

Don't beat yourself up for slipping up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. You've got this.

t3_12akapp,[Need advice] Discipline with ADD,"Hi guys, ever since I remember I've had issues with discipline when it comes to school. I got through high school one way or another with luck, but now I'm at uni and I can't go into tests without studying anymore. I feel it's hard to start, when I've already started I can go ahead and do a lot, but actually getting up and opening my laptop/books is really hard.. I'm diagnosed with ADD and I've heard other people also struggle with this.

Anyone who also has these issues/has some advice? Thanks","Plan to open your book or laptop as if you're going to study. Once you've opened it you're allowed to study or close it again immediately if you want. After you've done this a few times (for example, just before each meal), it will be easier. Then you can plan something bigger, like studying for at least 1 minute, or at least 5 minutes, etc. Pretty soon you'll be studying.",Accountability/Study partner(s),"Hey there! Dealing with ADD and trying to build discipline can definitely be challenging, but you're not alone in this. One strategy that might help is breaking your study sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks. Try using the Pomodoro Technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can make starting feel less overwhelming and help maintain focus. Also, consider creating a dedicated study space that's free from distractions, and set specific times for studying to build a routine. Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to your university's support services; they often have resources and accommodations that can make a big difference. Keep at it, and remember that progress is progress, no matter how small!","Starting is often the hardest part, especially with ADD - you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Since you mentioned you can work well once you actually begin, let's focus on making that initial push easier.

Try breaking down the ""starting"" phase into tiny steps. Instead of thinking ""I need to study,"" make it ""I just need to sit at my desk."" Then ""I just need to open my laptop."" Each micro-step feels more manageable.

A technique that works well for many people with ADD is the ""5-minute rule."" Promise yourself you'll work for just 5 minutes. That's it. Usually, once those 5 minutes are up, you'll naturally want to continue since you've already overcome the activation energy hurdle.

Setting up your environment can make a huge difference too. Keep your study space clean and organized. Put your books/laptop in plain sight before going to bed. Remove obvious distractions like your phone from the area. The easier you make it to start, the more likely you'll do it.

Consider using the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. Knowing there's a break coming up soon can make starting feel less daunting.

Remember that building discipline is like building muscle - it takes consistent practice and gets easier over time. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate the wins when you successfully get started.","I totally get where you're coming from - it's like there's a huge hurdle to overcome just to get started. One strategy that might help is breaking down your study sessions into super small, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to study for hours,"" try telling yourself ""I'll work on this one problem/set of notes for 10 minutes."" Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've made a tiny bit of progress, you can build momentum from there. Additionally, consider using the Pomodoro Technique - work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help make studying feel less overwhelming and allow you to take advantage of your ability to focus once you're engaged. It might also be helpful to identify a specific ""starting ritual"" that signals to your brain that it's time to study, like making a cup of coffee or doing a quick exercise routine. Have you talked to your uni about any accommodations or support services they might offer for students with ADD? They may have some additional resources or strategies that can help you succeed.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. ADD definitely throws a wrench into the whole discipline thing, especially when it comes to starting tasks. What's helped me is breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of ""study for history,"" it's ""open history book"" or even just ""put history book on desk."" Seriously, make the initial step so easy it's almost impossible to say no to.

Another thing that works for me is using the Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Knowing there's a break coming up helps me stay on track. There are tons of apps and timers for this.

Also, try to figure out *why* you're avoiding starting. Is it boring? Too overwhelming? If it's boring, can you make it more interesting somehow? Maybe study with a friend or listen to music (if it doesn't distract you too much). If it's overwhelming, break it down into even smaller chunks.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect, and that's okay. Just keep trying different strategies until you find what works for you. Good luck!

t3_w6kqfl,[Need Advice] i am not a person,"I do not feel like a person

I am an 18 year old man

There is a lot im doing wrong and i am scared, the emotions i feel are wrong, all my behavior or lack thereof is causing me fear

1. I am filled with false fear, fear that does nothing but prevents me from taking the steps to improve myself, i am always afraid when i try to think of improvement and i do not move as a consequence

2. I have no real personhood or core self, i do not hold any values, morals or virtues, my personality shifts to situation and person and it sickens me because i want to be a person but i am no one when i am not being stimulated and i have no real person to call myself as that person

3. I lack thought, i feel like i dont think deeply enough and when i actually try it doesnt go anywhere, i am willing to try to learn more and get better at critical thinking but i am in a pathetic no thought state

4. I feel out of control of my body and mind, when the desire comes to do sinful acts or be angry or overall act on instinct/impulse, i always fail at control or restraint, even before the initial urges my mind stops and i cant control myself or maybe thats what i like to say to ease myself of responsibility

5. My laziness is a constant in my life, i dont know if it is from the fear but i am in an inactive state, i do not have any discipline or internal anger to drive myself and i fail at trying to create that within me or i just dont try hard enough 

6. My psychology seems pretty simple, i look for a way out of most things or thought patterns because it scares or makes me uncomfortable, so i seek a way to stop feeling those things through false coping 

7. I live in patterns, i live day in and day out in patterns in my mind and my actions, it never ceases, i always can recognize the patterns which are harmful, but i am too paralyzed to stop them


I am only getting older, i know some responses are going to be about going to the gym but how do i even tell my ego and fear to shut up so i can get there

I am constantly depressing my dead relatives if they are watching by acting out in harmful ways to myself and others, i feel like i am made of stone, i stood on a bridge 3 months ago thinking about jumping but i knew i never could because i dont have the guts and i would rather survive the fall to get sympathy and live hedonistically and say i survived to fool others and myself into thinking i am strong 


I go to college soon, i dont know how to become more stable, maybe that is a lie too


Any advice please, i do want change but my subconscious knows how to avoid the change and be the same forever 

I dont want to be 35 years old and still be 18 mentally","One thing I will say is a lot of things that you seem to be beating yourself for, are the same types of problems that you’ll find in a lot of people. I know it feels like you’re alone in your struggles but you are not.

Also, while reading this, it’s seems like you are demanding a lot of yourself and punishing yourself when you don’t meet those standards. First thing, I’d say is to focus more on being more gentle with yourself. It’s ok to have desires but try to stray away from the “do or die” mindset and just focus on thinking of it more optimistically. Don’t think “I have to do this or x will happen” but more “If I do this, x will happen”. 

Train yourself to do that everyday and you’ll see change eventually. You’ll be looking at your life with a healthier perspective and your desires will naturally be answered because of that. Patience and perseverance is key though. Take it day by day, and don’t tell yourself that you are running out of time, as long as you are working towards what you want to accomplish in the present moment, you have time.","I’ve been there. Turns out I had a lot of trauma that turned into anxiety that turned into numbness and/or inappropriate emotional reactions. I didn’t understand me cuz I couldn’t feel me. And I couldn’t feel me because it was unbearable. 

Maybe it’s today. Maybe it’s five years from now. (A therapist or close friend can definitely help expedite the process.) One day you feel your feels. Pat yourself on the back if you do. This is called emotional processing and it’s necessary to heal but it doesn’t need to be rushed.

You’ll be okay.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to commend you for reaching out. That's a big step in itself. Here are a few thoughts that might help you start moving forward:

1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one small habit to work on. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or going for a 5-minute walk. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Try to spend a few minutes each day reflecting on your thoughts and feelings. Journaling can be a great way to get to know yourself better and start identifying what truly matters to you.

3. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide guidance and help you work through these feelings. It's okay to ask for help, and it can make a big difference.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break down your goals into manageable steps. Instead of thinking about where you want to be in years, focus on what you can do this week or even today.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and it's okay to have setbacks. Treat yourself with the same kindness and patience you would offer a friend.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this!","Hey there. First, know that what you're experiencing isn't uncommon at 18 - many people struggle with identity and feeling ""real"" at your age. But let's focus on some concrete steps you can take.

Start incredibly small. Your mind is throwing up barriers because you're trying to tackle everything at once. Instead of thinking about becoming a whole different person, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Something so small it seems almost ridiculous - like drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or standing outside for 30 seconds each morning.

The goal isn't the habit itself - it's proving to yourself that you can follow through on something. Each small win helps quiet that voice of fear and builds evidence that you can change.

For the gym specifically - don't think about ""becoming a gym person."" Just focus on putting on your shoes and walking to the door. That's it. If you make it there and turn around, you've still succeeded. Usually once you're there, you'll work out anyway.

About finding your core self - values aren't something you discover, they're something you build through actions. Pick one thing that matters to you (could be honesty, kindness, courage - anything) and take one tiny action aligned with it each day. Your identity will develop through what you do, not what you think about.

Consider talking to your college's counseling services when you start - they're usually free for students and can help you develop more tools for managing these feelings.

Remember: change happens through small, consistent actions, not giant transformations. Pick one tiny thing. Do it today. That's enough to start.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you're facing, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from yourself and unsure of how to break free from these patterns that are holding you back. 

One thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building self-awareness. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try to identify one area where you'd like to see improvement and start with tiny, manageable steps. For example, if you want to work on developing more discipline, you could start by committing to a daily routine that includes something as simple as making your bed or taking a short walk. 

It's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's normal for your values and personality to evolve over time. You don't have to have it all figured out at 18 - or even at 35, for that matter. What's important is that you're taking steps towards growth and self-improvement.

In terms of dealing with fear and ego, it might be helpful to practice some mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment, and give you the space to respond to them in a more intentional way. 

Lastly, it's great that you're recognizing the importance of seeking help and support. If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can work with you to develop strategies for overcoming these challenges. And don't be too hard on yourself - remember that it's okay to stumble and make mistakes along the way. The fact that you're acknowledging your struggles and wanting to change is a huge step in the right direction.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and recognizing these patterns is a huge first step. It takes courage to be this honest with yourself.

It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you don't have to fix everything at once. Start small. You mentioned the gym – instead of focusing on some massive transformation, could you just commit to putting on your workout clothes and walking around the block? Seriously, that's it. The goal isn't to become a bodybuilder overnight, it's to break the inertia and prove to yourself that you *can* take action.

Regarding feeling like you lack a core self, that's something a lot of people struggle with, especially at 18. Values aren't just things you're born with; they're things you discover and cultivate. Try exploring different ideas and activities. What makes you feel genuinely good, not just momentarily distracted? What kind of person do you *want* to be? Start journaling, even if it's just a few sentences a day. It can help you identify your values and track your progress.

As for the ""sinful acts"" and lack of control, that's where building habits comes in. It's not about willpower, it's about creating systems. If you know you're prone to certain impulses, identify the triggers and try to avoid them. Replace those impulses with something healthier. For example, if you get the urge to do something you regret, try doing 10 pushups or going for a quick walk instead.

The patterns you're stuck in? Start by picking *one* small pattern you want to break. Don't try to overhaul your entire life. Just focus on that one thing. When you recognize the pattern starting, consciously choose a different action. It will be uncomfortable, but that's how you create new neural pathways.

College is a great opportunity for a fresh start. Join clubs, attend events, and meet new people. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and support your goals.

Finally, if you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a professional. There are people who want to help you, and you don't have to go through this alone. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 988.

You're not made of stone. You're a work in progress, just like everyone else. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep moving forward. You've got this.

t3_14ee1bu,[need advice]How can I stop slacking off and become the best version of myself?,"

Every night before I go to sleep, I regret the choices I did throughout the day.

Food that I promised myself I won't eat.
Books I said I would read.
Etc..

Each night I am trying to make myself hustle the next day but I just can't.

Every night I watch endless content and listen podcasts to get myself all motivated and fired up for the next day. In my head, I'm looking at myself like I will become successful one day. I tell myself I will stop being lazy and procnating. I will get up early and sleep early but nothing changes..

College started, but I haven't even login to check the syllabus. Intionally wasting time despite all this worries and overthinking is eating me up every single day. I lost control of myself. Im like failing in life and it's all my fault because of this constant overthinking and fears or anxiety.

I'ma lazy trash, gotta make a change but how?","You have to go easy on yourself. You won't get anywhere with self hatred and anxiety.

Just do 1 thing at a time, don't expect to change your entire life in a single day. Introduce each new routine in a slow drip, and remember to enjoy being lazy too. 

Also, motivational podcasts and online content is probably making you feel inadequate and lazy. Remember these people are entertainers and business people, they make money selling this imaginary version of themselves. They are also usually pretty old and established. If you are a young person going to school, you are still building your life, you can't compare your daily life to what they advertise online.",You were right with the wall of text lol,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're recognizing the need for change and reaching out for advice. That's a solid first step. Here's a simple approach you might find helpful:

Start small. Pick one habit you want to change and focus on that. For example, if it's about eating better, maybe start by swapping out one unhealthy snack for a healthier option each day. Once that feels natural, build on it.

Set realistic goals. Instead of aiming to read a whole book, try reading for just 10 minutes a day. Small, consistent actions can lead to big changes over time.

Create a routine. Try setting a specific time for when you’ll do certain activities, like studying or exercising. Consistency can help make these actions feel automatic.

Limit distractions. If endless content is a problem, try setting a timer for how long you'll watch or listen, and then move on to something productive.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Just keep moving forward, one step at a time. You've got this!","First off - you're not trash. You're someone who wants to improve, and that's already a great starting point. The gap between your nighttime motivation and daytime actions is super common.

Here's what's worked for many people in your situation: Start ridiculously small. Instead of trying to transform your entire life overnight, pick ONE tiny habit. Maybe it's reading just one page of a book. Or checking your course syllabus for just 5 minutes. Make it so easy you can't say no.

The key is to stop relying on motivation. Motivation is temporary - that's why your nighttime plans fizzle out by morning. Instead, focus on making things automatic through tiny steps. Want to read more? Put a book next to your phone. Want to check your syllabus? Set your browser homepage to your college portal.

For procrastination specifically: use the 2-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll only do something for 2 minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll keep going. ""I'll just read one page"" often turns into a chapter.

Don't try to change everything at once. Pick your smallest worry and tackle that first. Build some wins. Each small success will give you momentum for bigger changes.

Remember: consistency beats intensity. Doing something small every day is better than planning something huge and never starting. You've got this - just start super small and build from there.","It sounds like you're really struggling with self-discipline and feeling stuck in a cycle of procrastination. First, let's ditch the ""lazy trash"" label - that's not helping. Instead, acknowledge that you're recognizing your patterns and wanting to change, which is a huge step. 

Rather than trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small thing you can commit to doing differently tomorrow. Maybe it's as simple as logging in to check your college syllabus or reading for 15 minutes before bed instead of scrolling through content. Make it ridiculously easy so you can't say no to it. 

Also, consider setting a ""stop doing"" list - identify one thing you know is holding you back (like watching endless content before bed) and try to replace it with something more productive or relaxing. Don't worry too much about being motivated or feeling fired up - just focus on taking tiny actions that align with your goals. Celebrate those small wins, and use them as momentum to build new habits. You got this, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey, I've been there, and it sucks feeling like you're stuck in a loop. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to change everything at once, which can be overwhelming.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life overnight, try picking *one* small thing to focus on. Seriously, just one. Maybe it's reading one chapter of a book, or skipping that late-night snack just once. The key is to make it something achievable so you can actually succeed and build momentum.

Also, ditch the endless motivation content for a bit. It sounds like it's fueling the overthinking and anxiety. Action beats motivation every time. Just do *something*, no matter how small, and build from there.

For college, just log in and look at the syllabus for one class. That's it. Don't worry about catching up on everything, just take that one small step. You got this!

t3_13cmmnq,How do I study efficiently? [Need Advice] [ Study plan],"I am kinda confused whether this is the right subreddit for my issue or not. Actually I need some better advices and tips to get better. I have a story behind it which is pretty important to understand the backdrop of this question.

I had my medical entrance exam two days ago. I scored worse than I even expected. Also, I really worked hard for it. I'm not even kidding, I used to get up 4AM and sleep at 11pm. I worked hard. Nonstop. I still failed. I don't understand why this happened to me. Is something wrong with my approach to studies? Earlier in middle school, I used to work nonstop yet I'd never get tired. This burnout happened to me when it was really a turning point in my career. Regardless, now I have to gear up again and I don't want to face the same issue once more. 

Please help me out. What are somethings that I can do to get better? How do I improve? 

Some of my friends themselves accepted that they didn't even study that much for the test and they just got lucky and will crack it. What is it? I don't understand! How are they doing it?","You need to take take productive breaks, working non-stop will eventually backfire. I recommend the Pomodoro technique.","In break-times you shouldn't do anything dopaminergic (eating chips, surfing reddit, and so on). Instead just take a short walk or do some yoga","Hey there! It sounds like you've been putting in a lot of effort, and it's tough when things don't go as planned. First off, remember that hard work is never wasted; it's all part of the learning process. Here are a few tips that might help you study more efficiently:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: It's not just about the hours you put in but how effectively you use them. Try breaking your study sessions into focused, shorter periods with breaks in between (like the Pomodoro Technique). This can help prevent burnout and improve retention.

2. **Active Learning**: Engage with the material actively. This could mean teaching the concepts to someone else, doing practice questions, or discussing topics with peers. It helps reinforce what you've learned.

3. **Review and Reflect**: After each study session, take a few minutes to review what you've learned and identify any areas that need more attention. This can help you focus your efforts more effectively.

4. **Healthy Habits**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking time to relax. These are crucial for maintaining your energy and focus.

5. **Mindset**: Try to shift your focus from comparing yourself to others to improving your own performance. Everyone has their own journey, and what works for one person might not work for another.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to feel disappointed, but use it as motivation to adjust your approach and keep moving forward. You've got this!","First off, working hard isn't always the same as working smart. Studying from 4AM to 11PM is actually counterproductive - your brain needs proper rest to consolidate information and maintain focus.

Here's what you can do differently:

Study in focused blocks of 25-45 minutes with short breaks between. This is called the Pomodoro Technique and it helps maintain high concentration while preventing burnout. During breaks, step away from your desk, stretch, or get some water.

Test yourself constantly. Don't just read and re-read materials. Use active recall by closing your books and writing down everything you remember about a topic. Take practice tests under exam conditions. This helps identify weak spots and builds confidence.

Your friends who ""didn't study much"" probably had better study strategies or prior knowledge. Don't compare yourself - focus on finding what works for you. Quality beats quantity every time.

Create a structured study schedule with specific topics for each day, but keep it reasonable - maybe 6-8 hours of actual studying with breaks. Use the remaining time for exercise, proper sleep, and relaxation. Your brain needs this balance to perform well.

Start tracking what study methods give you the best results. Some people learn better by teaching concepts to others, some by drawing mind maps, others by solving problems. Experiment and adjust based on what works for you.

Remember: working smarter, not longer, is the key to better results. You've got the work ethic - now let's channel it more effectively.","It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure about your study approach after a disappointing exam result. First, let's acknowledge that putting in long hours doesn't always translate to better outcomes, and it's great that you're recognizing the need for a change. 

One potential issue might be the lack of balance and rest in your study routine. While it's impressive that you were waking up at 4AM and studying till 11PM, this kind of schedule can lead to burnout, which can negatively impact your ability to retain information and perform well on exams. It's possible that your friends who seemed to do well with less studying might have been more efficient with their time or had a better understanding of what to focus on.

To improve, you could try breaking down your study material into manageable chunks, setting specific goals for each study session, and incorporating regular breaks to help you stay focused and retain information better. It might also be helpful to review and adjust your study techniques, such as using active recall, summarizing notes in your own words, or creating concept maps to visualize relationships between ideas.

Additionally, it's worth considering that luck can play a role in exam performance, but it's unlikely to be the sole reason for your friends' success. They might have had a better understanding of the exam format, been more familiar with the types of questions asked, or simply been more effective at managing their time during the exam.

Rather than comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own progress and identify areas where you can improve. You could start by reflecting on what you think went wrong in your previous study approach and what changes you can make to avoid burnout and improve your efficiency. Remember that developing effective study habits takes time and experimentation, so be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to try new approaches until you find what works best for you.","Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about your exam results. It's incredibly frustrating to put in so much effort and not see the outcome you hoped for. It sounds like you're dealing with burnout, and that's a real thing that can seriously impact your performance.

First, cut yourself some slack. You clearly have the dedication, waking up at 4 AM is no joke. But dedication without the right strategy can lead to diminishing returns. It's not just about the *quantity* of hours, but the *quality* of your study sessions.

Here's a few things to consider:

*   **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition:** Instead of just passively reading, try testing yourself frequently. Flashcards, practice questions, even just trying to explain concepts out loud from memory. Spaced repetition (reviewing material at increasing intervals) can also help solidify information in your long-term memory.
*   **Breaks & Rest:** Seriously, this is crucial. Your brain needs time to process and consolidate information. Short breaks every hour (5-10 minutes to stretch, walk around) and a full day off each week can make a huge difference. Sleep is also non-negotiable. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep.
*   **Study Techniques:** Experiment with different study methods. Mind mapping, the Feynman Technique (teaching the concept to someone else), or even just changing your study environment can help you stay engaged and absorb information better.
*   **Analyze Your Mistakes:** Don't just brush off the bad score. Go through your past papers and identify *why* you got questions wrong. Was it a lack of understanding, careless errors, or time management issues? Understanding the root cause will help you target your studying more effectively.
*   **Don't Compare Yourself:** It's easy to get caught up in what your friends are doing, but everyone learns differently. Focus on finding what works best for *you*. Their ""luck"" might just be a different approach that suits them better.

It's possible your friends have a better grasp of the material with less effort, or they might be overestimating their performance. Either way, focus on your own journey.

Finally, consider talking to a tutor or academic advisor. They can provide personalized feedback on your study habits and help you identify areas for improvement. You've got this! It's a marathon, not a sprint.

t3_104a78m,[Need Advice]Why does it so hard to take the first step to bettering yourself whether it’s facing your fears or overcoming an obstacles or working towards a goal..,"
2023 already begun but my mentality of living life has been the same since 2015 and I’m so sick and emotionally tired of it. Taking the first step to self improvement has been a struggle for me. I really feel so anxious and scared to working towards my goals and things I need to work on. Spring semester starts next week and I still haven’t signed up for classes and back of my mind that’s all I worry about. I worry and stress myself so much but I’m not facing my fears. I don’t know what it could be whether it’s anxiety or am I living my life in boundaries and fears. 

It’s so easy for so many people to just do it and not care about the outcome or failure. All they do is just keep pushing forward meanwhile I’m viewing life like birds eye view, wanting to predict the outcome and this thoughts of what if I fail or what I mess up. This constant anxiety and overthinking is holding me back from achieving my goals and living life to the fullest. It’s like I’ve made restrictions and created boundaries in my head. Sometimes I feel like my mind has become a prison","Lots of people are in that situation.

Divide what you need to do into steps. Know what the first, very small step is. Focus on just that. Take one step, then relax and reward yourself.

As you start actually doing things, usually the anxiety associated with a given step diminishes. You get used to it.

Make that first step very, very small. Do something every day.","Instead of setting up a big task that you can fail or succeed, set smaller, achievable tasks that you're unlikely to fail.

Instead of  saying 'I'll get perfect marks this semester', say 'on week 1 of school I will study for 20 minutes each day and make sure I finish my assignments for that day'. Even if you skip one day of study, 20 minutes won't make much of a difference on your final grade. But if you do study each day for those 20 minutes, you can be sure you completed that day's task.

I'll set myself as an example. One of my life goals is to run a marathon. The thing is that I've never really done any serious exercise in my life.

So instead of saying 'I have to run a marathon or else', I said 'I will run for 3 minutes each day for one week', then increased it to 5 minutes and so on and so forth. Eventually, my body adapt and my technique will be enough to do a marathon.

It's the same with your grades, if you work small tasks diligently, academic success should be within reach.","Taking the first step can definitely feel overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with anxiety and overthinking. One thing that might help is breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of focusing on the entire semester, start with just signing up for one class. Once that's done, give yourself a small reward. This can help build momentum and make the process feel less daunting. Also, try to shift your mindset from worrying about failure to viewing each step as a learning opportunity. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right away. Progress, not perfection, is key. You've got this!","Taking the first step is often the hardest part because our minds can get caught up trying to plan everything perfectly. The truth is, no one can predict all outcomes - even the most successful people face uncertainty and failure regularly.

Here's what's helped many others break through this kind of paralysis: Start incredibly small. Don't think about the whole semester or your full set of goals. Just focus on one tiny action you can take in the next 5 minutes. For your immediate situation, that might be simply opening the course catalog website. Not registering yet - just opening the page. 

Once you do that first micro-step, the next small action becomes easier. Maybe spend 10 minutes browsing available classes. Then maybe write down 2-3 that interest you. Breaking it down into these tiny steps makes it far less overwhelming than trying to figure out your entire academic future at once.

Remember that ""failing"" at something is actually valuable data - it teaches you what doesn't work so you can adjust your approach. Every person you see confidently moving forward has their own collection of failures behind them. They just learned to see those setbacks as feedback rather than final verdicts.

The key is to get into motion, even if it's imperfect. Action creates clarity. Start with that one small step today - literally just opening the course website. You've got this, and taking action will help quiet those anxious thoughts better than any amount of planning ever could.","It sounds like you're really struggling to break free from the cycle of anxiety and overthinking that's holding you back from taking that first step towards self-improvement. One thing that might help is to focus on making tiny, almost ridiculously small, commitments to yourself. For example, instead of worrying about signing up for classes, tell yourself you'll just spend 10 minutes looking at the course catalog today. Or, commit to sending one email or making one phone call related to your goals. By starting with these tiny steps, you can build momentum and gradually become more comfortable with taking action. It's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have everything figured out, and that uncertainty is a natural part of the process. Rather than trying to predict every possible outcome, try to focus on what you can control in the present moment. Remember, it's not about being fearless, but about being brave enough to take that first step despite your fears. As for your spring semester classes, why not set a specific goal to sign up by the end of the week, and break down the tasks you need to complete to make that happen? Having a clear plan can help alleviate some of that anxiety and make it feel more manageable. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of being stuck in a rut and overthinking everything is super common. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get things ""right"" the first time, and that's paralyzing.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, maybe try breaking things down into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of signing up for all your classes, just spend 15 minutes browsing the course catalog. Or, if you're anxious about a specific goal, identify the absolute smallest action you can take towards it – even if it seems insignificant. The point is to build momentum and prove to yourself that you *can* take action without everything falling apart.

Also, try to reframe ""failure"" as learning. Everyone messes up, and it's how we learn and grow. Maybe keep a journal and write down what you learned from each ""failure"" – you might be surprised at how much you actually gain.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You've been feeling this way for a while, so it's going to take time to change. Celebrate the small wins and don't beat yourself up for the setbacks. You got this!

Area of interest: ???
Values to keep: honesty. 
Scope: ideally can connect to a lot of people.  
Skills: problem solving, creating too why not. 
Years of commitment: ideally LONG Term 

RN I identify 'disinterest' as a dry hole in my chest, or a heavy feeling of 'why am I here'. I need a sense of purpose I guess? 

Hobbies: I've been watching videos on history, conspiracy shit, self help, and some kpop stuff. 

Jobs I've already tried: 
1. sales (making money for a just a company is not fulfilling. Scope of influence is a little small for me.)
2. market research (large scope! I like learning about consumer and economic insights, but got pretty tired after 2 years. I'm analysing - always a plus, but not implementing solutions)
3. customer service (absolutely no. Pretty dry for me.)

Also, your skills in problem-solving and creating could be a great fit for fields like data analysis or product development, where you can see the impact of your work. As for your idea about self-help videos or daily routines on YouTube, it sounds promising! It could be a way to connect with people and share your journey, which aligns with your values. Just start small, maybe with a few videos, and see how it feels. Remember, finding your passion is often about trying new things and being open to where they might lead. Good luck!","It seems like you've already explored quite a few different paths, which is actually really valuable - you now know what doesn't fully click for you. Looking at your pattern, you seem drawn to analytical and creative pursuits that have broader impact. The physical sciences standing out as your last true interest is particularly noteworthy.

Have you considered combining multiple elements you've enjoyed? For example, your interest in physical sciences could merge with your content creation ideas - there's a huge demand for engaging science communication. Your background in psychology and economics adds valuable perspective for breaking down complex topics for others.

Instead of trying to find one perfect passion, try running small experiments. Pick something that interests you (like those science topics) and commit to a 30-day project. Could be writing daily posts, making short videos, or diving into research. The key is to set concrete goals and actually complete the experiment before judging if it's right for you.

Your values around honesty and desire for broader impact are great anchors. Rather than waiting to feel completely ready for something like YouTube content, start with a minimal viable version. Post once a week about a topic you're genuinely curious about, see how it feels, adjust based on feedback.

Remember that passion often follows competence - the more you develop skills in an area, the more engaging it becomes. Focus first on consistent action in a direction that aligns with your values, even if you're not 100% certain it's ""the one.""","It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and are trying to find something that truly resonates with you. First, kudos to you for exploring so many different areas - that takes a lot of courage and curiosity. One thing that stands out to me is your interest in physical sciences, which you mentioned was the last time you felt truly interested in something. Have you considered revisiting that or exploring related fields like environmental science, biotech, or even science communication? These areas could potentially align with your values of honesty and scope of influencing many people.

Also, it's great that you've been watching videos on history, self-help, and other topics - sometimes our hobbies can give us clues about what we're passionate about. You might want to try experimenting with creating content around these topics, like writing blog posts or even just discussing them with friends, to see if that sparks any excitement.

Regarding your idea of creating self-help videos or daily routine content on YouTube, that's definitely a viable option. However, instead of waiting until you're ""ready,"" why not start small and just begin creating? You could start by recording yourself talking about topics that interest you, or even just sharing your thoughts on social media. This can help you build momentum and see if it's something you enjoy.

Lastly, it might be helpful to reflect on what specifically is driving your desire for a sense of purpose. Is it the need to make a positive impact, to be creative, or to feel fulfilled? Once you have a clearer understanding of what's driving you, you can start exploring options that align with those values and goals.

It seems like you're searching for something that combines your interests, values, and skills into a long-term purpose. That's a big ask, so don't beat yourself up if it's not immediately clear.

Since you mentioned physical sciences sparked your interest, maybe revisit that. Could you take an online course or read some books to see if that feeling is still there? Even if it doesn't become a career, it could be a fulfilling hobby.

Also, you mentioned self-help videos. That aligns with your interest in helping people and your problem-solving skills. Instead of just sitting on the idea, maybe start small. Write down a few topics you're passionate about and outline a potential video. Even just the act of planning might give you more clarity.

The key is to experiment and not put too much pressure on yourself to find the ""perfect"" thing right away. Try to focus on small, actionable steps. Maybe dedicate 30 minutes a day to exploring one of these potential paths. Over time, you'll start to see which ones resonate and which ones don't. Good luck!

t3_vc6gdv,"[Need Advice] I’ve recently began reading again, but how could I better position myself to read more longer periods of time?","Thanks to this sub, I’ve gotten myself out of bed when my alarm goes off. 5:00am and I’m actually up, not laying in bed until 6:00am anymore!

I am a slower reader, and it’s a process for me to actually start reading, but I enjoy reading a lot once I get going.

Even 10-15 minutes could help you ease into the day and make reading a more consistent habit. Alternatively, you could carve out some time during your ""self-improvement"" block. Perhaps dedicate 15-20 minutes to reading before diving into other activities. This way, you’re not trying to squeeze it in when you’re already winding down for the night. Keep experimenting with your schedule until you find what works best for you!","First off, congrats on nailing that 5am wake-up - that's a huge win! For your reading goals, here are a few practical tweaks to consider:

Instead of using Wordle as your morning brain warm-up, you could shift your reading time to 5:00-5:30am when your mind is fresh. Many readers find early morning reading more productive since they're not fighting end-of-day fatigue. You could still do Wordle during breakfast.

Another option is to carve out 15-20 minutes during your lunch break at work. Having two shorter reading sessions (lunch + evening) might help you read more overall while working with your natural energy levels.

For your evening reading session, try starting at 8:45pm instead of 9:00pm. Those extra 15 minutes add up over time. You might also experiment with reading in a different position or location than where you sleep, which can help combat the sleepiness.

To improve reading efficiency, try using your finger or a bookmark as a guide while reading - it helps reduce eye strain and can increase reading speed. Some readers also find that soft instrumental music helps them stay focused longer.

Remember that consistency matters more than duration. Even if you only read 20-30 minutes per session, doing it regularly will naturally build your reading stamina over time.","It's great that you've established a consistent wake-up time and are making progress on your productivity. To increase your reading time, consider adjusting your ""self-improvement"" block from 7:30-9:00pm. You could allocate 30 minutes to an hour for reading during this time, and then use the remaining time for other self-improvement activities. This way, you can take advantage of the time when you're likely more alert and focused.

Another option is to explore your morning routine. Instead of doing Wordle, you could try reading for 15-30 minutes after waking up. This can help you get a head start on your daily reading goal and make the most of your fresh morning mind. Additionally, you might find that reading in the morning helps you feel more energized and sets a positive tone for the day.

It's also worth experimenting with your reading environment and habits to improve efficiency. Try finding a comfortable and quiet spot to read, and consider using a reading light or a specific type of music to help you focus. You could also set small goals for yourself, like reading a certain number of pages or chapters each day, to help stay motivated and track your progress. By making a few tweaks to your routine and reading habits, you can potentially increase your reading time and enjoy the benefits of reading more consistently.","Hey, congrats on the awesome progress with your morning routine! That's a huge win.

Regarding reading, it sounds like you're fighting against tiredness. A few thoughts:

First, could you shift some of your ""self-improvement"" time earlier in the evening to reading? Maybe swap 30 minutes of research with reading right after your son goes to bed. You might be fresher then.

Second, consider reading in smaller chunks throughout the day. Maybe 10-15 minutes during your lunch break, or even right after you get home from work before family time. Short bursts can add up!

Third, experiment with *what* you're reading at night. Maybe something lighter or more engaging than usual to keep you awake. Save the denser stuff for when you're more alert.

Finally, don't beat yourself up if you only read for 15 minutes. Consistency is key. Even a little bit each day adds up over time. Good luck!

t3_ydi7ga,[Need Advice] How do I fix my life,"I don't really have any friends. I have nojob. The only thing going for me is that I'm not ugliest guy in the world and im in ok shape physically. My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...

I wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines . At times I feel like I'm crazy cause I can be somewhat miserable on more than one occasion and can't interact very well with other people. People are fed up for good reason. I dont have a life","if you're good at physical training and like to help people, learn to be a fitness instructor and help ppl that way","It is never too late to start as long as you move in the right direction. A 10 or 100 small steps in the right direction  will still be 10 or 100 steps better then where you were before.

Having said that, make a list of things or goals in major areas of your life physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually. Break these into  20 small actionable steps.

E.g Physical goal: Want to get fit? Get up an hour early. Go for a walk, excercise or jog everyday for 30 minutes. Avoid junk food. Eat healthy. If you can do this for a month consistently, you would have done 15 hours of exercise and had an improved diet. Over a long term these add up and count.

List down similarly what you can do. In terms if finances, try getting a job. Create a resume. Update it to all job portals. Look an hour for all jobs available and apply. Ask friends for job openings.... you will land something.

Try going to mall or retail outlets and look for or ask for job. 

Everyday have a sense of accomplishment. Try saving one dollar a day, and put it in a jar where it is visible to you....

Join a library and read 2-3 pages of a book you like.

Listen to uplifting music.

Avoid wasting time.

Cut negative thinking and be friends and supportive to your self. 

Everyday try to encourage yourself and do better and be in a better place than yesterday. Remember every step ahead is progress. 

Believe in yourself. Change your mindset for a better you. 

I may not know you, but believe in you. Because you took the effort to write and get better. You can do it bro.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.

3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.

4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.

5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.

Remember, it's never too late to make changes and improve your life. You're not alone in feeling lost, and taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Keep pushing forward!","Hey there. First off, 31 is still young - you've got plenty of time to build the life you want. It's good that you already have fitness as a cornerstone habit and some savings to work with. Let's build on that foundation.

Start by creating a simple daily routine. Since you're already into fitness, use that as your anchor. Add one small habit at a time - maybe reading for 15 minutes after your workout, or spending 30 minutes learning a new skill online. The key is consistency over intensity.

For the career front, consider what interests naturally align with your fitness background. Personal training, health coaching, or even fitness-related content creation could be worth exploring. Or you might want to go in a completely different direction - that's fine too. Pick one direction and take small steps: update your resume, apply to one job daily, or take an online course in your chosen field.

For building relationships, look for local fitness groups or sports leagues. These give you a natural way to meet people while doing something you're already comfortable with. Meetup.com can be good for finding groups aligned with whatever interests you develop as you explore new activities.

Remember that everyone you meet who seems to ""have it together"" went through their own period of feeling lost. The difference is they kept moving forward, even if they weren't sure of the destination. Focus on taking one small action each day that moves you toward a better life, whether that's applying for a job, learning something new, or meeting new people. Progress compounds over time.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about how to move forward, which is totally understandable given everything you've been through. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you have some savings to fall back on and that you're taking care of your physical health through fitness - those are definitely positives to build on. 

One thing that might help is to start small and focus on building one or two new habits or routines outside of fitness. This could be something as simple as reading for 30 minutes each day, learning a new skill or hobby, or volunteering in your community. Sometimes, having a sense of purpose or feeling like we're making progress in one area can help spill over into other areas of our lives.

It's also worth considering seeking out some professional help, whether that's a therapist or counselor, to work through some of the underlying issues that might be contributing to your feelings of depression and isolation. They can help you develop strategies for managing your emotions and improving your relationships with others.

As for feeling like you're making a difference in people's lives, that's a really admirable goal. You might consider looking into local volunteer opportunities or joining a community group that aligns with your interests. This could be a great way to meet new people and start building a support system, while also feeling like you're contributing to something bigger than yourself.

Lastly, try not to be too hard on yourself about your past relationships or the fact that you don't have everything figured out at 31. Lots of people are still finding their way at this age, and it's never too late to make positive changes in your life. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging where you're at and wanting to make a change - now it's just about taking things one step at a time and being patient with yourself as you work towards building a more fulfilling life.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's awesome that you're reaching out and recognizing the need for change. 31 is definitely not old, and it's totally possible to rebuild and create a fulfilling life.

Since you already have fitness as a positive habit, let's build on that. Think about what aspects of fitness you enjoy – is it the structure, the physical challenge, the feeling of accomplishment? Try to apply those elements to other areas.

Job-wise, even small steps can make a difference. Could you dedicate just 30 minutes a day to job searching or skill-building? Maybe take an online course related to something you're even remotely interested in. The key is consistency, even if it's just a little bit each day.

Regarding relationships, it's understandable that you're feeling isolated. Instead of focusing on finding a romantic partner right now, maybe try joining a group related to your fitness interests or a hobby you'd like to explore. It's a low-pressure way to meet people with shared interests. Even volunteering could help you feel like you're making a difference and connect with others.

As for feeling ""crazy,"" it's normal to have ups and downs. Maybe consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and help you develop coping mechanisms. It's a sign of strength to ask for help.

Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on building one positive habit at a time. You've got this.

t3_pcdp1e,[Need advice] I have always been a loser,"Why just why, why I am so stupid, dumb, indecisive, loser. I can go on and on disparaging myself, I am tired of being a loser never good at anything always failing, I've got my exam close pretty much sure I'll fail in this one too. What do I do, I am very pessimistic and critical about myself. I wasted my one year of high school and now I am below everyone, they all are enjoying having time for themselves while here I have to do hardwork, I hate how much ignorant I was. I wanna get good marks too, seeing everyone doing good in their life I just can't help but think I am good for nothing, just a burden on everyone I am related to, and I should leave everything.
I need help of someone please dm me, it'd be great","I know it’s hard and advice always sounds easier said than done but. 

The only opinion that matters here is yours, so stop comparing yourself to anything and accept yourself just the way you are.","You are right... But I tried that mindset, it doesn't works, I still stay as a loser. It's difficult to not compare when the other person is better than you, just because you were dumb","Hey there, first off, I want to say that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated, but it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people have felt the same way at some point. The good news is that you can turn things around with some small, consistent steps.

Start by setting very small, achievable goals for yourself. It could be something as simple as studying for 15 minutes a day or organizing your study space. The key is to build momentum and confidence with these small wins. Over time, you can gradually increase the difficulty and duration of your tasks.

Also, try to shift your focus from comparing yourself to others to focusing on your own progress. Everyone moves at their own pace, and that's perfectly fine. Celebrate your small victories, no matter how minor they seem.

Lastly, consider reaching out to a teacher or counselor at your school for support. They can offer guidance and resources to help you improve your study habits and manage your workload.

Remember, it's not about where you start, but where you're headed. You've got this!","Hey there. First off, you're not a loser - you're someone who's struggling and wants to improve. That already shows potential for growth. 

Let's break this down into manageable steps. You mentioned being behind in high school - that's a temporary situation that can be turned around. Instead of comparing yourself to others (which never helps), let's focus on what YOU can do right now:

Start with small wins. Pick one subject that needs the most attention and dedicate 25 minutes to studying it. Just 25 minutes. Use the Pomodoro technique - study for 25, break for 5. This helps build momentum without overwhelming yourself.

For your upcoming exam: Make a simple study schedule. Break down what you need to review into small chunks. Even if you're behind, starting now is better than not starting at all. Find practice questions online and tackle them one at a time.

The past year? It's done. You can't change it, but you can learn from it. Your classmates aren't ""ahead"" - they're just on their own path. Focus on your path.

Consider reaching out to your teachers for extra help. Most are willing to assist students who show initiative. You might also find study groups helpful - they can provide structure and accountability.

Remember: Building discipline isn't about massive changes overnight. It's about small, consistent actions that add up over time. Start with one small goal today. Then another tomorrow. Keep building from there.

You've got this. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you want to change. That's the first step.","It sounds like you're really struggling with self-doubt and feeling overwhelmed. First, let's tackle the idea that you're a ""loser"" - that's not a definition of who you are as a person. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to struggle in certain areas. Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes, try to focus on what you can control right now. You've got an exam coming up, so let's break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Make a study plan, set specific goals for each day, and reward yourself when you reach those goals. Celebrate your small wins, even if it's just understanding a difficult concept or completing a practice test. As for your self-criticism, try to reframe your thoughts in a more positive and realistic light. Instead of saying ""I'm stupid,"" say ""I'm struggling with this subject, but I can learn and improve."" You don't have to go through this alone - consider talking to a teacher, counselor, or trusted adult about how you're feeling. They may be able to offer additional support and guidance. Remember, it's never too late to make a change and start working towards your goals. You've already taken the first step by reaching out for help, so keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step at a time.","Hey, I get that feeling of being behind and overwhelmed. It sucks, but it's definitely not a permanent state. First, stop the self-bashing. Seriously. It's like trying to dig yourself out of a hole while simultaneously shoveling more dirt in.

Since your exams are coming up, let's focus on that. Forget about the entire year you feel you wasted. You can't change the past, but you *can* influence the future. Break down your studying into tiny, manageable chunks. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of ""study chapter 3,"" try ""read the first paragraph of chapter 3 and summarize it in one sentence."" Then take a 5-minute break. Then do the next paragraph. The key is to make the initial step so small it's almost impossible to fail.

Also, compare yourself to *yourself* yesterday, not to everyone else. Are you studying even 5 minutes more today than you did last week? That's a win. Celebrate those small victories.

Finally, if you're feeling overwhelmed and like you want to leave everything, please reach out to a professional. There are people who want to help you through this. You can find resources online or talk to a school counselor. You're not alone in feeling this way, and things *can* get better. Good luck with your exams, you've got this!

t3_ynzgor,[Need Advice] Unable to beat Chronic Procrastination for 3 years despite numerous attempts,"It's been a horrible and terrible 3 years of my life. I've tried every trick in the book to beat this procrastination that has ruined my life. I have tried counseling, therapy, pomodoro, positive reinforcements, negative reinforcements, forest app, study rooms, balance app and numerous other ways to get me to watch the lectures and do the studying. I've got panic attacks, anxiety issues, weight loss and lack of sleep for the last 3 years because of this.

I've got a great support system at home and everything else in my life is going great as well. But this is the reason I wake up in the morning feeling as though someone is stabbing me in the heart and feel pukish whenever I think about it.

It's 4 papers which must be written together (granted it's very very difficult papers, but I've not even got to the difficult part because I haven't even finished the video lectures), and I've been unable to watch it completely for 3 years now despite allocating so much time and energy of my life to it.

Cycle: I do not consistently stick to the plan, I get severe anxiety when the exams get close by cause I'm nowhere close, that turns into full blown paranoia and panic attacks, I skip the exam, drown myself in guilt, tears and regret, then decide to get my shit together and make a plan and then it goes back to the start of the cycle. I've done this for 7 exam cycles now and I cannot take it anymore, but I will not quit this. I will not take a break either, so please don't suggest it to me. 

I need a solution that will help me stick to the plan of watching video lectures and then studying it after, because despite these terrible consequences to my actions, I am still not able to stick to my plan and I want to change that. I have to be consistently disciplined for me to pull through this and I cannot rely on myself or self discipline, as I've tried and failed at it too many times. I would appreciate any input you might have. Cheers :)",Beware. Check out this user’s commenting history. He’s been shilling this app almost exclusively.,"Yeah OP like another commenter said you haven't addressed why you procrastinate. You focus on the symptoms but not the root of the problem!! That could be why you keep lapsing over the years. What needs of yours are not being met? Do you have any mental illnesses, depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc.? If so are you getting trearment for them?

It's awesome that you're trying hard to get things done!! But the goal of productivity is not for productivity's sake, it's for YOUR sake. You undoubtedly want this, but something is getting in the way, and we gotta know what. I hope it's just how you wrote the post and you're not actually neglecting yourself of care and attention!!","Hey there! It sounds like you're really determined to tackle this, which is a great start. One approach you might try is breaking down your tasks into even smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of focusing on completing an entire lecture, aim to watch just 5-10 minutes at a time. Set a timer and commit to just that small segment. Once you finish, take a short break and then decide if you can do another 5-10 minutes. This can help reduce the overwhelming feeling and make it easier to get started.

Also, consider pairing this with a reward system. After completing a small chunk, give yourself a little treat or do something you enjoy for a few minutes. This can help create a positive association with the task. 

Lastly, accountability can be a game-changer. Since you have a great support system, maybe ask someone to check in with you regularly about your progress. Sometimes knowing that someone else is aware of your goals can help keep you on track. Keep pushing forward, and remember that progress, no matter how small, is still progress. You've got this!","Thanks for sharing your situation - it takes courage to be this honest about what you're going through. The cycle you described is brutal, but we can work on breaking it.

First, let's shrink this mountain into manageable hills. Instead of thinking about all 4 papers or even completing full lectures, start with just 10 minutes of one lecture. That's it. Set a timer, watch 10 minutes, then stop. Do this once per day for a week. Don't worry about taking notes or understanding everything - just watch. The goal is to build consistency with zero pressure.

Once you can do 10 minutes consistently, bump it to 15 minutes. Then 20. Small increases. The key is that you're allowed to stop when the timer ends, even mid-sentence. This removes the pressure of completion and lets you build momentum.

For accountability, try the ""seinfeld strategy"" - get a physical calendar and put an X through each day you complete your minutes. Your only job is to not break the chain of X's. This works because it shifts focus from the overwhelming end goal to just showing up each day.

When anxiety hits, remember: you're not sitting down to write 4 papers or master the material. You're just showing up for today's minutes. That's all you have to do.

You mentioned you can't rely on self-discipline, so don't. Rely on systems instead. Timer + Calendar + Small chunks = A system that works even when motivation doesn't. 

Start with 10 minutes tomorrow. Just 10 minutes. Post back here in a week and let us know how it's going.","I can sense the desperation and frustration in your post, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. It's clear that you've tried a wide range of strategies to overcome your procrastination, but nothing seems to be sticking. One thing that stands out to me is the sheer amount of pressure you're putting on yourself to complete these 4 papers, and the devastating consequences you experience when you don't meet your own expectations. 

Rather than trying to tackle the entire problem at once, I'd suggest breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of focusing on watching all the video lectures, try committing to just 10-15 minutes of lecture watching per day. That's it. Don't worry about studying or taking notes, just show up and watch the lectures for that short amount of time. 

Additionally, you might want to consider implementing a ""pre-game"" routine to help signal to your brain that it's time to focus. This could be something as simple as making a cup of coffee, doing a quick 5-minute meditation, or going for a short walk. The goal is to create a consistent trigger that tells your brain it's time to get to work.

It's also important to acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle, and that it's okay to ask for help. Since you have a great support system at home, consider sharing your daily goals with them and asking them to hold you accountable. This could be as simple as sending a text message each day saying ""I watched my 10 minutes of lectures"" or ""I didn't watch my lectures today, I'll try again tomorrow"".

Lastly, I want to emphasize that it's not about being consistently disciplined, but rather about being consistently gentle with yourself. You've been through a lot, and it's time to start treating yourself with kindness and compassion. Remember that it's okay to have off days, and that one missed day doesn't mean you've failed entirely. You've got this, and you can take it one small step at a time.","Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, and it's admirable that you're determined to keep fighting. It's clear you've tried a lot, so let's think outside the box a bit.

Since relying on yourself hasn't worked, let's focus on external accountability and breaking things down *smaller*. You mentioned study rooms, but maybe you need something even more structured. Could you find a virtual study group that meets daily, even if just for an hour, specifically to watch lectures? The key is that you're not alone, and there's a set time you *have* to show up.

Also, those papers sound daunting. Instead of focusing on ""watching all the lectures,"" can you break it down into *tiny* chunks? Like, ""watch 10 minutes of lecture and then summarize it in one sentence."" Seriously, that small. The goal isn't to learn everything at once, it's to break the paralysis. Celebrate those tiny wins.

Finally, since anxiety is a major factor, have you explored mindfulness or meditation techniques specifically for managing panic attacks *during* study sessions? There are apps and guided meditations that can help you ground yourself in the moment when you feel that anxiety rising. It's about interrupting the cycle *as it's happening*, not just dealing with the aftermath. Good luck, you've got this.

t3_q9a6kz,[NEED ADVICE] Struggling to get my life started.,"Im 24, I live with my parents and waist a lot of their money, I've been trying to get into university since I graduated from high school, but I just dont get accepted. Im afraid of getting a mediocre job and getting so caught up in it that I don't ever get back to studying. I really want to get a degree in mechanical engineering and I believe I'll be quite good at it, Im really good at designing and working on cars and want to use my degree to persue my passion for building race cars. The logic of physics kinda comes to me naturally but Im really bad at math. I have a girlfriend and I love her to bits, but we've been arguing a lot because we've been together for nearly five years and she hasn't seen me grow at all. What would you do if you were in my situation?",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a tough spot, but it's great that you have a clear goal in mind with mechanical engineering. Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Math Skills**: Since math is a hurdle, try focusing on improving this area. There are tons of free resources online like Khan Academy or Coursera that can help you build a solid foundation. Set aside a little time each day to practice, and you'll see improvement over time.

2. **University Applications**: If you're not getting accepted, it might be worth looking into why. Reach out to admissions offices for feedback on your applications. Consider community college as a stepping stone; you can often transfer to a university later.

3. **Job and Study Balance**: If you're worried about getting stuck in a job, look for positions that are related to your field of interest. This way, you can gain relevant experience and keep your passion alive while you work towards your degree.

4. **Relationship**: Open communication with your girlfriend is key. Share your plans and progress with her, and maybe even involve her in your journey. It might help her see your growth and support you better.

5. **Discipline and Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for studying, job searching, and personal growth. Consistency is key, and even small steps can lead to big changes over time.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this!","First, let's address the math concern - being ""bad at math"" isn't permanent. Math is a skill that improves with practice, just like working on cars. Since mechanical engineering requires strong math skills, start dedicating 1-2 hours daily to math practice. Khan Academy has excellent free resources that can help you build from the basics up.

While preparing for university, you need a game plan. Get a part-time job in an auto shop or related field - this serves multiple purposes. You'll gain relevant experience, stop depending on your parents financially, and still have time to study. Plus, hands-on experience can actually make engineering concepts clearer when you do start university.

For university applications, research exactly why you're getting rejected and what successful applicants are doing differently. Each rejection is data you can use to improve. Consider starting at a community college to boost your academic record and transfer later - many successful engineers took this path.

Your girlfriend's concern is valid - but growth isn't just about having a degree. Show her you're serious by taking concrete steps: get that job, create a strict study schedule, and start building your math foundation. Track your progress and share your wins with her.

Remember, building race cars isn't just a dream - people are doing it right now. But they got there through consistent, daily effort. Start treating each day as a stepping stone toward that goal, and be patient with yourself while maintaining momentum.","It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure about how to move forward with your goals. First, let's break down some of the things that are holding you back - your struggles with math are a significant obstacle for pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, so it might be worth looking into some online resources or tutoring to help you improve your math skills. Additionally, not getting accepted into university doesn't mean you should give up - consider taking some community college courses or online classes to get a feel for the material and build your confidence. 

As for your fear of getting caught up in a mediocre job, it's understandable, but having some kind of income can actually help reduce stress and give you the freedom to pursue your passions on the side. You don't have to view a job as a permanent thing - it can be a stepping stone to get you where you want to go. And it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling and what you're working towards, so she can understand your perspective and support you in your goals.

Lastly, it's great that you have a clear idea of what you're passionate about - building race cars is a unique and exciting goal. Maybe try to find ways to get involved in that world now, even if it's just volunteering or helping out with a local racing team. That way, you can start building connections and learning more about the industry, which can help motivate you to keep working towards your degree. Remember, getting your life started is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time - don't be too hard on yourself, and just focus on making progress, no matter how small it may seem.","Hey man, it sounds like you're at a crossroads, which is tough but also a chance to steer things in the right direction. First off, don't beat yourself up too much. 24 is still young, and plenty of people feel lost at this stage.

It sounds like you have a clear goal (mechanical engineering and race cars), which is a huge advantage. The math hurdle is real, but definitely not insurmountable. Instead of just broadly ""being bad at math,"" try to pinpoint the specific areas where you struggle. Khan Academy is a free resource that lets you target specific math skills. Start with the basics and work your way up. Even 30 minutes a day can make a difference over time.

As for getting into university, have you looked into community colleges? They often have programs that can help you improve your grades and transfer to a four-year university later. Plus, they're usually more affordable.

Regarding the job situation, maybe look for something related to cars, even if it's not your dream job. Working in a garage or auto parts store could give you valuable experience and keep you connected to your passion while you work on your math skills and university applications. It also shows your girlfriend you're taking steps to improve.

Finally, talk to your girlfriend. Explain your plan and how you're actively working towards your goals. Communication is key. Show her you're committed to growing, both for yourself and for your relationship. Small, consistent steps are the key to building momentum. You got this!

t3_132a4tj,"[need advice] How do you come out of self doubt, fear and overthinking?","
Does anyone feel like they’re over analyzing life and any decisions or tasks to work on. Like why do we over complicate things and any task we try to do, how come overthinking and fear prevent us from doing it. Why do we take people words personally and let it affect us. How come we self sobotage or live in our thoughts and inner voice all day. Even if we haven’t done any physical work, we still feel like emotionally mentally drained by the day. It’s like we are trapped in some cage. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of switching major but not sure exactly about it yet I’m over analyzing and doing pros cons but at the end all I get is frustrations and overwhelmed feeling. It’s like why am I going in circles..","I literally take meds for my obsessive thinking, and they work","Well, I would kill my psychiatrist if my pills didn’t do their work","Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of mental clutter, which is super common, especially when facing big decisions like switching majors. One thing that might help is setting aside a specific time each day to just sit with your thoughts. Give yourself 10-15 minutes to write down everything that's on your mind without judgment. This can help clear your head and make it easier to see what's really important.

Also, try breaking down your decision into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of trying to solve everything at once, focus on one aspect at a time. For example, research one potential major for a day, then take a break. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Life is a series of experiments, and it's perfectly fine to change your mind as you learn more about yourself and your interests. Be kind to yourself in the process!","Overthinking often comes from wanting to make the ""perfect"" decision, but perfect decisions don't exist - only decisions we can learn and grow from. The key is to start taking small actions instead of getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

For your major decision, try this approach: Set a firm deadline (say, 2 weeks) to make your choice. During this time, talk to people in both fields, shadow them if possible, or take an intro class. But when the deadline hits, make your choice with the information you have. Remember you can always adjust course later - your major doesn't permanently lock you into a career path.

For the broader overthinking issue, start practicing ""time-boxing"" your decisions. Give yourself a strict time limit to think about choices, then commit to action. Start with tiny decisions - ""I'll spend 2 minutes deciding what to eat, then just pick something."" As you build confidence with small choices, apply it to bigger ones.

Also, try this mental shift: Instead of viewing decisions as permanent and scary, see them as experiments. Each choice is a chance to learn something new about yourself and what works for you. The only true failure is staying stuck in analysis mode and not taking action at all.

Your awareness of these thought patterns is actually a strength - now you can start catching yourself when you spiral into overthinking and redirect that energy into small, concrete steps forward.","It sounds like you're really struggling with analysis paralysis and self-doubt, which can be totally debilitating. One thing that might help is to set a timer for, say, 10-15 minutes and just write down all your thoughts and concerns without stopping or editing yourself. This can help get everything out of your head and onto paper, where you can start to see patterns and prioritize what's really important. From there, try to break down big decisions (like switching majors) into smaller, more manageable tasks - like researching different programs, talking to advisors, or shadowing someone in a field you're interested in. This can make the decision feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of momentum. Additionally, consider setting aside specific times of the day for ""thinking"" and ""worrying"", so you can try to contain those thoughts and not let them bleed into the rest of your day. As for taking things personally, it might be helpful to remind yourself that other people's opinions often say more about themselves than they do about you - and that it's okay to acknowledge their words without internalizing them. Lastly, don't underestimate the power of taking small actions towards your goals, even if it feels like you're not making progress - sometimes just showing up and doing something, anything, can help build confidence and get you out of that feeling of being stuck.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of being stuck in your head. It's super common, and it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now.

First off, it's okay to feel emotionally drained even without physical work. Overthinking IS work, and it's exhausting! You're essentially running mental simulations all day, and that takes a toll.

About the major switch: the pros and cons list is a good start, but maybe try a different approach. Instead of just listing, try *experiencing*. Can you shadow someone in the field you're considering? Take an introductory class? Even just watching relevant documentaries or reading articles can give you a better feel than endless lists.

As for the overthinking in general, a couple of things have helped me:

*   **Mindfulness:** Even a few minutes of daily meditation (there are tons of free apps) can help you become more aware of your thoughts *without* getting swept away by them.
*   **Small Actions:** Break down tasks into ridiculously small steps. Instead of ""write a paper,"" it's ""open the document."" The momentum can help you overcome the initial inertia.
*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you catch yourself spiraling, ask yourself: ""Is this thought actually helpful? Is it based on facts, or just assumptions?""

Finally, remember that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with overthinking and self-doubt. Be kind to yourself, and focus on making small, consistent progress. You got this!

t3_w1n869,[Need advice] was doing great and now I'm depressed,"

Was doing pretty well, started going to the gym and studied a bit.But then my hair started falling out in huge amounts :( , I'm losing so much hair and everyone pointing out that my hair is everywhere is getting me even more anxious and depressed.How to push through unforseen circumstances which drag you into slumps like this.",It wasn't your fault. Don't blame yourself for things that are out of your control.,"When you get stressed, don’t look at the whole staircase; just look at the next step. Soon enough you’ll feel better. Then another challenge will come. And another. You get better at dealing with it after you go through it enough times. Good luck!","I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds tough, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. When unexpected challenges like this come up, it's important to focus on what you can control. First, consider seeing a doctor or dermatologist about your hair loss to get some professional advice. It might help ease your anxiety to know what's going on and what you can do about it. In terms of discipline, try to maintain the habits you were building, even if it's at a reduced level. Going to the gym and studying, even in smaller amounts, can help maintain a sense of normalcy and control. Also, remember to be kind to yourself. It's okay to have setbacks, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as physical health. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or professionals if you need it. You've got this!","Hair loss can definitely feel overwhelming, but don't let it derail the great progress you've been making with the gym and studying. First, consider seeing a doctor to understand what's causing the hair loss - it could be stress, nutrition, hormones, or other treatable factors. While you work on addressing the underlying cause, try to maintain your positive routines since they contribute to your overall wellbeing.

When facing unexpected setbacks, it helps to focus on what you can control. Keep up with your gym routine - exercise is great for managing stress and anxiety. For the hair situation, you might want to try using a hair catcher in the shower and cleaning up right after brushing to reduce visible hair around you. This can help minimize anxiety-inducing reminders throughout the day.

Remember that your worth isn't tied to your hair, and the habits you're building are making you stronger both physically and mentally. Take it one day at a time, and celebrate the small wins - whether that's completing a workout, having a good study session, or simply showing up for yourself despite feeling down. The ability to push through tough times is a skill that gets stronger with practice.","It's really tough when unexpected issues like your hair loss come up and derail your momentum. First, take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed - it doesn't mean you've failed or that all your progress is lost. When life throws you curveballs, it's essential to reassess and adjust your goals temporarily. Consider taking a break from the gym if the stress of people noticing your hair loss is too much, and focus on smaller, manageable tasks like short walks or some light stretching at home. For studying, try breaking it down into even shorter sessions than before, so it feels less daunting. Remember, discipline is not about being perfect; it's about being consistent and kind to yourself, especially during difficult times. You might also want to look into ways to manage your hair loss, like talking to a doctor or finding a supportive community online - sometimes tackling the root cause (no pun intended) can help you regain control and confidence. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's okay to not be okay right now.","Hey, that sounds really rough, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling down. Hair loss can be a huge hit to your confidence.

First off, have you seen a doctor about the hair loss? It could be a medical issue that's treatable, and getting that checked out might ease some anxiety.

As for pushing through the slump, try to focus on what you *can* control. You were going to the gym and studying – those are great habits! Even if you can't do them at the same intensity right now, try to maintain them in some form. Maybe shorter workouts or just reviewing notes for a bit. The key is to keep the momentum going, even if it's slow.

Also, consider breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of ""study a bit,"" try ""read one chapter."" Instead of ""go to the gym,"" try ""walk for 20 minutes."" Small wins can build you back up.

Finally, ignore the comments about your hair as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know, but remind yourself that their comments say more about them than about you. Focus on taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. You got this!

t3_13c8bjf,[need advice] When you’re slacking but you realize yet don’t do anything about it.,"Sometimes whether it’s our habit or doing something repeatedly even though we deep down realize, it’s not helping us. But we still keep doing it. We say we will change or try to improve but honestly don’t take any action upon it. But we feel bad yet why do we keep doing it. How can we break this barrier honestly.","Take one step. Don’t wait for tomorrow, don’t start Monday. Don’t start when everything is ‘in order’ just move one step forward.
The momentum will build I promise","Set small goals, like I will brush my teeth tomorrow, then do it. Ride that high, set slightly tougher goals, repeat.

This will train your ability to set goals and accomplish them. Its not about waiting until you feel like it, or if your motivated to do it.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, which is totally normal. Breaking out of it can be tough, but here are a few steps that might help. First, try to identify the specific habit or behavior you want to change. Once you have that, set a small, achievable goal related to it. For example, if you're trying to cut down on screen time, start with a 15-minute reduction each day. Next, track your progress. This could be as simple as marking a calendar or using an app. Seeing your progress can be really motivating. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Change takes time, and every small step counts. Keep at it, and you'll get there!","This is a really common struggle - knowing what you need to change but feeling stuck in patterns that don't serve you. The key is understanding that motivation usually follows action, not the other way around. Start ridiculously small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE tiny change you can make today. Something so small it feels almost laughable.

Want to exercise more? Start with literally 1 minute. Want to read? Read one page. Want to study? Set a 5-minute timer. The point isn't the actual amount - it's about breaking through that initial resistance and building momentum.

What helps me is treating it like an experiment rather than a permanent commitment. ""Let me just try this tiny thing for 3 days and see what happens."" It takes the pressure off and makes it feel more manageable.

The other crucial piece is making it harder to slack off. If social media is your weakness, delete the apps and only access them through browser. If you procrastinate in bed, put your phone across the room. Create friction for the habits you want to break and remove friction for the ones you want to build.

Remember that change isn't linear. You'll have setbacks, but they're not failures - they're data points helping you understand what works and what doesn't. Start small, be consistent with that tiny change, and build from there. The momentum will come.","I think what you're describing is a really common phenomenon where we get stuck in a cycle of knowing we should make a change, but not actually taking the steps to do so. One strategy that might help is to start by acknowledging that it's okay to feel this way and that it doesn't mean you're flawed or weak. From there, try to identify the underlying reasons why you're struggling to take action - is it fear of failure, comfort with familiarity, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of what's holding you back, you can start to break down the change you want to make into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, instead of saying ""I'm going to completely overhaul my habits,"" try saying ""today, I'm going to take one small step towards my goal, like doing 10 minutes of exercise or reading for 15 minutes."" By focusing on tiny, achievable wins, you can start to build momentum and develop the discipline to make larger changes over time. It's also important to be kind to yourself and recognize that setbacks are a normal part of the process - don't give up just because you slip up, but instead learn from the experience and keep moving forward.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's like being stuck in a loop. One thing that's helped me is to really break down *why* I'm avoiding the thing I know I should be doing. Usually, it boils down to fear of failure, or the task just seems too overwhelming.

If it's fear, try reframing it. Instead of thinking ""I have to do this perfectly,"" think ""I just need to make a start, and it's okay if it's messy."" If it's overwhelm, break the task down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, *really* tiny. Instead of ""write a chapter,"" it's ""write one sentence."" Once you get that first sentence down, you might find it easier to keep going.

Also, be kind to yourself. Feeling bad about not doing something just makes you feel worse and less likely to start. Acknowledge the feeling, but then actively choose to focus on the small step you *can* take right now. Good luck, you got this!

t3_rfpojk,[Need advice] getting and staying motivated without urgency,I have found urgency to be an unhealthy and unsustainable method through which to achieve my goals. It always leads to suicidal/depressive/apathetic tendencies and rushing through life for me. But it's the most consistent thing I have currently for getting stuff done. Do people have experience with getting past the need for constant urgency to move forward in life?,,,"It sounds like you're looking for a way to stay motivated without relying on the pressure of urgency, which is a great step towards a healthier mindset. One approach is to focus on building small, consistent habits that align with your goals. Start by identifying one or two small actions you can take daily that contribute to your larger objectives. This could be as simple as dedicating 10 minutes a day to a task related to your goal. Over time, these small actions can build momentum and create a sense of progress without the stress of urgency. Additionally, try setting clear, realistic goals with specific timelines that allow for flexibility. This way, you can maintain a sense of direction without feeling rushed. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Celebrate your small wins and be patient with yourself as you develop this new approach.","Using urgency as motivation is like constantly revving your engine in the red zone - it works short-term but eventually burns you out. The key is building sustainable systems that don't rely on that fight-or-flight response.

Start by breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks that don't feel overwhelming. Instead of ""I must do this NOW,"" try ""I'll work on this for just 25 minutes today."" The Pomodoro Technique is great for this - set a timer, focus for a bit, then take an actual break.

One effective approach is to create a ""minimum viable day"" - the bare minimum you need to do to consider the day a win. Make it ridiculously easy at first, like ""write for 5 minutes"" or ""read one page."" This builds consistency without the pressure of urgency.

Also consider tracking your progress visually. Something as simple as marking Xs on a calendar for each day you follow through can be surprisingly motivating. You'll start wanting to maintain your streak, which is a much healthier driver than constant urgency.

Remember that motivation follows action, not the other way around. You don't need to feel motivated to start - just show up and do the minimum. The momentum builds naturally from there, and you'll likely find yourself wanting to do more once you've begun.

The shift from urgency to consistency takes time, but it's worth it for your mental health and long-term success. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on building sustainable habits rather than rushing to the finish line.","I totally get why you'd want to break free from the urgency cycle - it's exhausting and clearly taking a toll on your mental health. One strategy that might help is to focus on building intrinsic motivation, rather than relying on external pressures like deadlines or consequences. This could involve exploring why your goals are important to you, and what values they align with. By connecting with your underlying reasons for wanting to achieve something, you may find that you're more motivated to take consistent, sustainable action towards it. Additionally, you might consider implementing a ""systems over goals"" approach, where you focus on building daily habits and routines that support your long-term objectives, rather than fixating on specific outcomes. This can help you make progress without feeling like you're constantly racing against the clock. Have you tried breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks, and then scheduling them into your daily or weekly routine? Sometimes, having a sense of control and agency over our time can be really liberating, and help us stay motivated without needing to feel urgent all the time.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Riding that urgency wave is exhausting and definitely not a long-term solution. It sounds like you're looking for a more sustainable way to get things done, and that's awesome.

One thing that's helped me is focusing on building systems instead of relying on motivation. Motivation is fleeting, but a good system will keep you moving even when you don't *feel* like it. Think about breaking down your goals into really small, manageable steps. Like, instead of ""write a chapter,"" maybe it's ""write for 15 minutes.""

Also, try to connect your goals to your values. When you're clear on *why* something is important to you, it's easier to stay consistent. Maybe journaling about your values and how your goals align with them could help.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to have off days. The key is to just get back on track as soon as you can. Don't beat yourself up about it. Good luck, you got this!

t3_ulrxly,[Need Advice] paralysing anxiety about study load,"you know the advice about how you eat an elephant? a bite a time? It just doesnt work for me. when i see advice about breaking up a task into smaller ones to help finish it, it doesnt work for me. i cant help but visulaise the work laod in its entirety, like i literally worry about the shit load of smaller tasks i need to do to achieve completion of the task at hand. What then follows is paralysis and lots of struggle to even start the task at hand. I am a perfectionist and also afraid of failure so that all makes for an enormous amount of difficulty while studying. when i have exams nearby, i really find the workload scary, like im all alone with this workload and feel lonely af. it is weird but my heart just feels so heavy.

I really need to do well in an upcoming exam because my previous ones have put me in a precarious position at uni. My graduation gpa could be low and i could loose my scholarship. i really cannot afford to underperform. \[i am sayin this in case anyone might suggest the 'its okay to fail' advice, which is cool but not something i could afford atm\]

does anyone else experience this? how do you deal with this? i do go to therapy but i cant go very often these days due to my finances. i have anxiety too but my psych doesnt think i need meds atm. any tips that i could use immediately might be great. p.s. i already meditate and do coloring because i find it therapeutic.",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. One approach that might help is to focus on creating a routine that prioritizes consistency over perfection. Try setting a specific time each day dedicated to studying, even if it's just for 20-30 minutes. The key is to make it a non-negotiable part of your day, like brushing your teeth. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by making studying a regular habit rather than a massive task.

Also, consider using a timer to work in short bursts, like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break). This can make the workload feel more manageable and give you a sense of accomplishment with each completed session. 

Lastly, try to connect with classmates or study groups online. Sharing the experience with others can alleviate the loneliness and provide mutual support. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking small, consistent steps can lead to big changes over time. Good luck with your exams!","Hey there - I totally get that ""eating the elephant one bite at a time"" feels impossible when you're overwhelmed by seeing the whole thing. Here's what's helped me with similar study anxiety:

Instead of breaking tasks into smaller pieces (which can feel like multiplying the workload), try timeboxing. Set a timer for just 25 minutes and tell yourself ""I only have to study for these 25 minutes."" Don't think about what comes after. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. This is called the Pomodoro Technique, and it helps because you're focusing on time rather than task size.

For dealing with perfectionism during study sessions: Write down exactly what ""good enough"" looks like for each study session before you start. Example: ""Review one chapter and be able to explain the main concepts."" Having clear, realistic endpoints helps prevent the perfectionist spiral.

Since you mentioned feeling lonely with the workload - have you considered finding a study buddy or joining a study group? Even if you're working on different subjects, having someone else quietly working nearby can make it feel less isolating. Many universities have study halls or libraries where you can do this.

The anxiety you're feeling is actually your brain trying to protect you from failure, but it's overcompensating. When you feel that heaviness start, try this grounding technique: Name 5 things you can see in your study space, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It helps bring you back to the present moment.

Remember: You don't have to feel motivated or confident to start studying. You just have to start. The focus and momentum will build once you're in motion.","I totally get why the ""one bite at a time"" approach doesn't work for you - when you're a perfectionist, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of smaller tasks. One strategy that might help is to focus on the very first step, and only the first step, until it's done. Instead of thinking about all the smaller tasks, try to identify the smallest possible action you can take to move forward, and commit to doing just that one thing. For example, if you're studying for an exam, your first step might be as simple as opening your notes or textbook, or making a cup of coffee to get settled in. By focusing on that one tiny action, you can build momentum without feeling overwhelmed by the bigger picture.

It's also great that you're already meditating and doing coloring - those are excellent coping mechanisms. In addition to those, you might find it helpful to set ""study sprints"" with short breaks in between. This can help make your study sessions feel less daunting, and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each sprint. Since you mentioned you're on a tight budget and can't attend therapy as often as you'd like, you might also consider looking into free online resources, such as anxiety management apps or YouTube channels focused on productivity and mental health.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, even if that feels like it's not enough. You're doing the best you can with the resources you have, and that's something to be proud of. Keep in mind that your goal is to make progress, not to be perfect - and it sounds like you're already taking some really positive steps towards managing your anxiety and staying on top of your studies.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work. It's like the mountain just keeps getting bigger. Since breaking things down isn't working for you, maybe try a different approach: focus on *starting* instead of *finishing*.

Instead of visualizing all the tasks, pick *one* tiny, almost ridiculously small task related to your studying. Like, literally just opening your textbook to the first page of the relevant chapter. Or writing the title of the chapter on a blank page. The goal isn't to accomplish anything significant, just to break the initial inertia.

Once you've done that one tiny thing, see if you can do another tiny thing. Maybe read the first paragraph. The key is to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible. Don't even think about the whole exam or your GPA. Just focus on that one tiny step.

Also, since you're feeling lonely with the workload, could you find a virtual study buddy? Even just having someone else working alongside you (even if it's over Zoom or Discord) can make a huge difference. Knowing someone else is grinding too can ease that feeling of isolation.

Finally, perfectionism is a killer. Try to reframe your thinking. Instead of aiming for perfect, aim for ""good enough for now."" You can always refine things later. The important thing is to get something down on paper (or on the screen). Good luck, you got this!

It could be as simple as drawing for five minutes or taking a short walk. These small wins can help build momentum over time. Also, consider looking into online resources or communities for mental health support that might be free or low-cost. Sometimes, just talking to someone who understands can make a big difference.

What you're going through sounds really challenging, and it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. Since professional help isn't currently an option, let's focus on some practical steps you can take right now.

Start with the absolute basics - pick just ONE tiny thing to do each day. It could be making your bed, drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or sketching for 5 minutes. The key is to make it so small it feels almost impossible to fail. Success with tiny steps helps rebuild your confidence and momentum.

Speaking of art - instead of waiting for inspiration or trying to create finished pieces, try setting a timer for just 5 minutes of doodling each day. No pressure to make anything good. The goal is simply to show up and move your pencil. Over time, those 5 minutes might naturally grow longer as your creative energy returns.

For the social aspect, consider finding art communities online where you can gradually build new connections while maintaining healthy boundaries. This can help reduce that emotional dependency while still getting some social interaction around something you love.

Remember that rebuilding discipline isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that's okay. Focus on consistency over intensity - doing something tiny every day matters more than occasional bursts of productivity.

Start today. Pick your one tiny action, do it, and celebrate that small win. Then do it again tomorrow. That's how you begin to rebuild.","It's great that you're recognizing the need to make a change and wanting to take small steps towards improving your situation. Given your love for art, maybe start by setting a tiny, achievable goal related to it, like dedicating 10-15 minutes a day to doodling or sketching. This can help you build momentum and get your creative juices flowing again. As for pushing yourself to do things, try to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Instead of thinking ""I need to create something amazing,"" tell yourself ""I'm going to show up and make something for 10 minutes today."" This can help make the task less overwhelming and more manageable. Additionally, since you mentioned you're used to being busy and hardworking, try to identify one small task that you can commit to doing daily, like taking a short walk or doing a few push-ups. Celebrate these small wins, and use them as a foundation to build upon. Remember, it's okay to start small and take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the ideas in your head right now, just focus on making progress and being kind to yourself throughout the process.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's completely understandable that you're finding it hard to get motivated. It's great that you recognize the emotional dependency and want to make a change – that's a huge first step.

Since professional help isn't easily accessible right now, let's focus on what you *can* do. You mentioned taking small steps, and that's key. Don't try to go from zero to a hundred overnight.

Start ridiculously small. Like, *really* small. Instead of ""work on art,"" try ""look at art for 5 minutes."" Seriously. Set a timer. No pressure to create, just look. Maybe browse an art blog, flip through a book, or even just stare at a color you like. The goal is to break the inertia and associate art with something other than pressure.

Another thing: you mentioned feeling frustrated because you used to be so hardworking. Try to let go of that comparison for now. You're not that person right now, and that's okay. Focus on building a new foundation, brick by brick.

Also, regarding the need to contact your friends, try journaling instead. Write down everything you want to say to them. It can help release some of that pent-up emotion without falling back into the dependency you're trying to avoid.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Depression is a real thing, and it's not a character flaw. Celebrate those tiny victories, even if it's just getting out of bed. You've got this. Just keep taking those small steps.

t3_10ob1fh,How do you keep on top of cleaning a house? [NEED ADVICE],Ive always struggled with being untidy and I genuinely don’t know how people manage the tasks needed to keep a home clean and tidy so I’m looking for some advice.  My current methods centre around a huge clean/ tidy occasionally or a panic clean before guests arrive. I’d love to just maintain a level but can’t seem to ever manage it.,"No advice but just some food for thought - the 40+ hr work week was established when the assumption was that you would have a stay-at-home wife to do all of your cooking/cleaning/housework. If you are living on your own or living with partner and you both work, it is way more common to be behind on all of your cleaning than on top of it all the time. It is hard! I am right there with you struggling to keep my apartment clean. I don't think enough people acknowledge that it's hard to keep up when you also have a full time job and it's ok to have a little mess sometimes.

Good luck fitting more cleaning into your days and be kind to yourself!","Admittedly, by apartment is very small, but this is what I do:

Everyday, I just clean for 20 minutes. Sometimes, I make it 30, but 20 minutes is all I usually need, but I never do less than that. There is an amazing amount of housework that can get done in just 20 minutes. You won't finish on day 1, but keep going and every day your house will be a little bit more clean and tidy, until one day, you've run out of things to do during those 20 minutes.

The thing here though, is that on any given day, I don't make more mess than would take me more than 15 min to clean up (except on maybe days where I cook and bake *a lot* as dishes will take longer on those days). So 15 min is my base needs + 5 extra minutes to make sure I eventually can start cleaning my desk drawers. Be honest: how much mess do you make every day?","One approach that might help is to break down cleaning into smaller, manageable tasks and spread them out over the week. Instead of waiting for a big clean, try setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to tackle specific areas. For example, you could focus on the kitchen one day, the bathroom the next, and so on. Creating a simple schedule can make it feel less overwhelming and more routine. Also, consider setting a timer to keep you focused and prevent the task from dragging on. Over time, these small efforts can add up to a consistently tidy home. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection!","The key to maintaining a tidy home is breaking it down into small, manageable daily tasks rather than letting everything pile up for big cleaning sessions. Start by establishing a ""clean as you go"" mindset - when you finish using something, put it away immediately. This alone makes a huge difference.

Create a simple routine where you spend 10-15 minutes each morning and evening doing basic tidying. In the morning, make your bed, put away dishes from the dish rack, and quickly wipe down bathroom surfaces. In the evening, do a 10-minute pickup of any items out of place, load/run the dishwasher, and wipe kitchen counters.

For deeper cleaning, assign different tasks to specific days. Maybe bathrooms on Monday, vacuuming on Wednesday, dusting on Friday, etc. This way, you're never facing an overwhelming amount of cleaning at once. Set a timer for 20 minutes - you'd be amazed how much you can get done in focused bursts.

The real game-changer is building these small habits until they become automatic. Don't try to transform everything overnight. Start with one simple daily habit like making your bed or doing dishes after dinner. Once that becomes natural, add another. Within a few weeks, you'll have a sustainable routine that keeps your home consistently tidy without the need for panic cleaning before guests arrive.

Remember: consistency beats intensity. Small daily actions will get you much further than occasional marathon cleaning sessions.","One strategy that might help is breaking down cleaning tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and assigning them to specific days of the week. For example, you could dedicate Mondays to quick pick-ups of clutter, Tuesdays to dusting, Wednesdays to vacuuming or mopping, and so on. This way, you're not feeling overwhelmed by trying to tackle everything at once. Additionally, consider implementing a ""one touch rule"" where you try to put things away in their designated place as soon as you're done using them, rather than letting clutter build up. It might also be helpful to set a timer for 10-15 minutes each day to do a quick tidy, which can make a big difference over time. Remember, it's all about creating habits and being consistent, so start small and see what works for you.","Hey, I totally get the struggle! It sounds like you're stuck in a feast-or-famine cycle with cleaning, which is super common. The key is breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Instead of aiming for a spotless house all the time, try focusing on one small task each day. Maybe it's wiping down the kitchen counters after dinner, doing a load of laundry, or just spending 15 minutes tidying up one area. The ""2-minute rule"" can be helpful here - if a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately (like putting away shoes or wiping up a spill).

Also, try to identify your biggest pain points. What areas get messy the fastest? Focus on those first. Maybe it's the kitchen sink or the entryway. If you tackle those regularly, the rest will feel less overwhelming.

Finally, be kind to yourself! It's a process, and you're not going to be perfect overnight. Celebrate the small wins and don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Consistency is more important than perfection. Good luck, you got this!

t3_ow4ft3,[need advice] I don’t know what to do after I get out of bed,"I can get out of bed sure but I don’t have anything to do I’m on summer vacation I’m 15, but I have barely any responsibilities all I do is workout, do a few quick chores and off I’m scrolling on YouTube I listen to music as a hobby but i want more hobbies I just get up late because I don’t have much to do help",Maybe try to add a couple hobbies to spend 30-60min every day on? Read a book. Maybe learn the guitar or keyboard or another  language. Take a bike ride or run/walk every day. Try woodworking or building things. Offer yard or car washing services in your area to make some $. Just some ideas :),"Since you're in high school try volunteering at local areas, it helps with colleges and keeps you active","Hey there! It’s awesome that you’re looking to make the most of your summer. Since you’re already working out and doing chores, you’ve got a good start. Here are a few ideas to fill your day with more activities:

1. **Learn Something New**: Pick up a new skill or hobby. You could try learning a musical instrument, coding, drawing, or even cooking. There are tons of free resources online to get you started.

2. **Set Small Goals**: Try setting daily or weekly goals for yourself. It could be reading a book, writing a short story, or completing a puzzle. Having something to work towards can give your day more structure.

3. **Volunteer**: Look for local volunteer opportunities. It’s a great way to meet new people, gain experience, and make a positive impact in your community.

4. **Explore Nature**: If you can, spend some time outdoors. Go for a walk, hike, or bike ride. It’s a great way to clear your mind and get some fresh air.

5. **Create a Routine**: Even if you don’t have a lot of responsibilities, having a routine can help you feel more productive. Try waking up at the same time each day and planning out your activities.

Remember, it’s all about experimenting and finding what you enjoy. Good luck, and have fun exploring new things!","Hey there! Summer vacation at 15 is actually a perfect time to explore new interests and build some structure into your days. Since you already work out and handle chores, you've got a good foundation - let's build on that.

First, try setting a consistent wake-up time even during vacation. It helps create momentum for the day. Then, consider picking up some skills that'll be useful long-term. Learning to code is completely free online through sites like Codecademy. Since you're into music, maybe try learning an instrument or music production - there are tons of free resources for both.

Reading is another solid hobby that can fill time productively. Your local library probably has free ebooks and audiobooks you can access from home. You could also start a creative project - writing, digital art, or even starting a YouTube channel about music reviews.

Want something more active? Look into bodyweight fitness routines to complement your workouts, learn to cook (super useful life skill), or pick up running/cycling. These are all basically free and can give your days more structure.

The key is to experiment. Try different things for a week each. Some won't stick, and that's fine - but you might find something you really love. Start small with 30-60 minutes a day on a new activity, and build from there.","It sounds like you're feeling a bit aimless without a structured schedule. First, kudos to you for recognizing that you want more out of your days and being open to exploring new hobbies. Since you enjoy music, you might consider learning an instrument or producing music - there are plenty of online resources to get you started. As for other hobbies, you could try drawing, writing, or even coding. The key is to experiment and find what truly interests you. 

In the meantime, why not set a few small goals for yourself each day? This could be as simple as reading a chapter in a book, taking a walk outside, or trying a new recipe. Having something to look forward to can make getting out of bed more exciting. You might also consider setting a consistent wake-up time and creating a morning routine that works for you - this can help give your days some structure even without a traditional schedule. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about scrolling through YouTube; it's okay to have some downtime, just try to balance it with more engaging activities. What do you think might be a good starting point for you?","Hey, that's a pretty common feeling when you've got a lot of free time. It sounds like you've already got a good base with working out and chores, so that's awesome! Since you're into music, maybe try learning an instrument or diving deeper into music production if you're not already. Summer's a great time to experiment.

To give your days more structure, try setting a simple daily goal, like ""learn 3 new guitar chords"" or ""read one chapter of a book."" It doesn't have to be huge, just something to give you a little direction. Also, think about what you're *curious* about. Is there anything you've always wanted to try but haven't? Could be anything from coding to drawing to learning a new language. Use YouTube to learn new skills.

Finally, maybe try setting a consistent wake-up time, even on vacation. It can make it easier to get motivated and feel like you're actually accomplishing something during the day. Good luck!

t3_u909b4,[Need Advice] How to somewhat start over in my 30s…,"Hi there, I’m looking for advice on how to move forward in my 30s - been speaking to friends and counsellors regarding my lack of action, self-loathing, difficulty in applying myself and the skills gained or developed, and the difficulty of following through. I’m creative (design, arts, music, digital), athletic, enjoy being around people, enjoy leading or teaching skills to others, and desiring a much needed change. Really needing independence, and not sure how to apply myself in regards to finding new jobs that might be out of reach, or I may find interest in but don’t have all the necessary knowledge, education, software knowledge, etc. I’m not sure how long this process would take but let’s say if finding a new job could happen within a few weeks to a month, that would be great. I am faced with a lot of defeat and inaction due to failures and doubts in my past, and require the necessary know-how to overcome such obstacles. I’ve never met people in my shoes within my social circles, it seems like everyone has their head on their shoulders, have a lot of energy, and are readily taking on life’s challenges each day (such as work, school, managing finances, managing time better, having two jobs, working 12 hour shifts, balancing a social life, dating, etc). I just feel like this ongoing weirdo with a lack of direction and drive, and much of this is hidden while I just play the role of a “happy clown” (can confirm this, friends said I seemed really happy today, but this is without knowing what’s going on inside/in my life), meanwhile I really know my life needs to be in order.","This sounds so much like a classic ""quarter-life crisis"". Look that up and see how others deal with it.","That mindset of ""everybody else has their stuff together except me"" will work against you. 

Make a comprehensive list of everything that matter to you and take them one at a time .

I suggest reading a book, or three, if you like to read.. And i don't mean fictional books.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make a change. It sounds like you have a lot of creative and athletic talents, which is a fantastic foundation to build on. Starting over in your 30s can feel daunting, but it's definitely doable. Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Identify Your Strengths and Interests**: You mentioned enjoying design, arts, music, and teaching. Consider roles that might combine these interests, like teaching art or music, or working in a creative team. 

2. **Skill Up**: If you're worried about lacking certain skills or software knowledge, there are tons of online resources and courses that can help you upskill quickly. Websites like Coursera, Udemy, or even YouTube can be great for this.

3. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, set small, manageable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning a new skill or applying to a certain number of jobs each week.

4. **Network**: Reach out to people in fields you're interested in. LinkedIn can be a great tool for this. Sometimes, just having a conversation with someone in the industry can provide insights and opportunities you hadn't considered.

5. **Mindset Shift**: It's easy to compare yourself to others, but remember that everyone has their own struggles. Focus on your journey and progress. Celebrate small wins and be kind to yourself.

6. **Seek Support**: Keep talking to your friends and counselors. They can provide support and accountability as you work towards your goals.

Remember, it's okay to feel like you're starting over. Many people reinvent themselves multiple times throughout their lives. You've got this!","Hey there - first off, know that feeling directionless in your 30s is way more common than you might think, even if your social circle seems to have it all figured out. The ""happy clown"" facade is something many people maintain while working through similar challenges.

Starting over career-wise is totally doable, especially with your creative background. Instead of trying to transform everything at once, pick one specific direction that interests you most right now - maybe UI design, digital art, or creative direction. Then break down the exact skills gap between where you are and where you need to be for entry-level roles in that field.

For the next month, create a simple daily routine: Spend 2-3 hours each morning working on those specific skills before anything else. Use free resources like YouTube tutorials, Coursera, or industry-specific training sites. The key is consistency over intensity - even an hour a day of focused learning adds up quickly.

While building skills, start putting together a portfolio of practice work. This gives you something concrete to show potential employers, even without formal experience. Network on LinkedIn and reach out to people in roles you're interested in - many are happy to share advice or even mentorship.

The self-doubt and past failures feel heavy, but they don't define your future capabilities. Focus on taking small, consistent actions each day rather than getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Success builds on itself - each small win will help rebuild your confidence and momentum.

Remember that everyone you see ""crushing it"" started somewhere and likely faced similar doubts. Your creative and interpersonal skills are valuable assets - now it's just about channeling them in a specific direction with consistent daily effort.","It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure about how to move forward with your life, especially when it seems like those around you have their lives together. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the need for change and are seeking help - that's a huge step. It might be helpful to start by breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of finding a new job or gaining new skills, try focusing on one thing at a time. For example, you could start by updating your resume, or taking an online course to learn a new software or skill. This can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment. 

It's also important to remember that everyone faces challenges and setbacks, even if it doesn't seem like it from the outside. Those friends who seem to have their lives together might be struggling with their own issues, and it's unlikely that anyone has everything figured out all the time. Rather than comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own strengths and interests. You mentioned being creative, athletic, and enjoying teaching and leading - these are all great skills that could be applied to a variety of careers or pursuits.

In terms of finding a new job, it might be helpful to start by exploring different fields or industries that align with your interests and skills. You could also try reaching out to people in your network who work in areas that interest you, and ask if they'd be willing to chat about their experiences. This can be a great way to get a sense of what different careers are like, and might help you find something that's a good fit.

Lastly, be patient with yourself and try not to put too much pressure on finding a new job or getting your life together in a short amount of time. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's unlikely that everything will fall into place overnight. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's normal for it to take some time to figure things out. You got this, and taking small steps towards your goals can add up over time.","Hey, it sounds like you're feeling stuck, but also like you have a lot of potential and self-awareness, which is a great starting point. It's totally normal to feel lost in your 30s, so don't beat yourself up too much.

First, about the job search: a month might be tight for a complete career change, but it's doable to get the ball rolling. Instead of aiming for the ""perfect"" job right away, think about smaller steps. Could you freelance in one of your creative areas to build a portfolio and gain confidence? Even a few small projects can make a difference. Also, look into online courses or tutorials for software you need to learn. Many are free or low-cost, and even a basic understanding can open doors.

Regarding the ""happy clown"" thing, it's good you're aware of it. It's exhausting to keep up a facade. Maybe try being a little more vulnerable with a *trusted* friend or family member. Just sharing what you're going through can lighten the load.

As for overcoming past failures, try reframing them. Instead of seeing them as proof of inadequacy, view them as learning experiences. What did you learn from each one? How can you apply that knowledge moving forward?

Finally, don't compare yourself to others. Everyone's journey is different, and social media often shows a highlight reel, not the full picture. Focus on your own progress, no matter how small. Start with one tiny, achievable goal each day – maybe it's spending 30 minutes on a job application, learning a new software skill, or going for a walk. Celebrate those small wins. You got this!

t3_ph4bt8,[Need Advice] how to wake up early and not feel tired all day long?,"i'm currently 18 and just finished high school for the majority of which i woke up at 10 or 11am. i tried waking up early a few months ago and got down to 6am and noticed that my days felt a lot longer and productive but i've been a little stressed lately. i need to get an overwhelming amount of work done in very little time and just the thought of it tires me out. i'm currently at an all time low where i sleep at 6am and wake up at 4pm and get nothing done, feel terrible about myself and fall back into the cycle again. some of the things i've tried which didn't work out-

\-the biphasic sleep cycle 

\-staying up all night and day so i could go to sleep early the next night (multiple times)

\-all kinds of alarm things (putting it far away from bed, getting a puzzle alarm app etc.)

\-going on a run with someone early morning to wake up out of obligation (the only thing that was starting to work out but my friend bailed on me lol)

i feel like it's because i feel demotivated all the time nowadays. i tell my mom to wake me up but she doesn't really bother. if i do manage to get up early somedays, i feel tired no matter what i do and end up taking naps that last for hours (leading to not feeling sleepy at night and falling back into the cycle). i've tried coffee but it really doesn't work on me. i don't think i'm a night owl because i can get nothing done at night. i desperately want to establish a healthy sleep pattern and stick to it because the few times i've done it helped me become wayyy more productive and happy. every piece of advice would be helpful, thank you so much!",Buy sleeping mask. It helped me to sleep at 7pm and wake up at 3am in the college back then.,"I'm older than you now, but I struggled with this same exact issue. It's working for me now, but it took a lot of practicing to get here! Listen to your body to try not to get too discouraged.

Some less-vague ideas:
Sometimes I get up and do something else for a bit, then lay back down, and sleep comes easier. (Usually just something relaxing, like reading.) Other times I'll stay in bed, but try to occupy myself with something else. I'll try to say the alphabet backwards, or just tell myself I'm only going to relax tonight and not sleep. (It helps to take the pressure off!)

When I was really struggling, watching Futurama was the only thing that would slow my mind down enough to let me fall asleep. Not that I'd recommend using screens, but sometimes I just felt I needed a crutch. I kept reading & tried to learn more about how sleep works, and eventually I was falling asleep earlier & easier. I also experimented with other aspects, like diet, meditation, exercise, etc.

When I have nights now that I struggle through, I have a lot of practice with concepts that work for me. And I know why they work for me, which helps getting back to sleep much less stressful!

I think you're on the right track! I know how much it sucks to go through this, but I really do think any work you put in will pay off for you in unexpected ways.","Hey there! It sounds like you're really trying to make a positive change, and that's a great first step. Here are a few things you might try to get back on track:

1. **Gradual Shift**: Instead of trying to make a drastic change, gradually adjust your sleep schedule. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can help your body adjust more naturally.

2. **Consistent Routine**: Establish a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.

3. **Morning Light**: Get some sunlight in the morning. Natural light can help reset your circadian rhythm and make you feel more awake.

4. **Wind Down**: Create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could be reading, taking a warm shower, or doing some light stretching.

5. **Limit Naps**: If you need to nap, try to keep it short (20-30 minutes) and avoid napping late in the day.

6. **Caffeine and Screens**: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and limit screen time an hour before bed. The blue light from screens can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.

7. **Accountability Partner**: Since running with a friend helped, maybe find another buddy or join a group that meets in the morning. Having someone else involved can be a great motivator.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Be patient with yourself and keep experimenting to find what works best for you. Good luck!","Getting your sleep schedule back on track is totally doable, but you'll need to tackle this systematically rather than trying to force dramatic changes overnight. Here's what works:

First, start by shifting your schedule gradually. Instead of jumping straight to 6am, move your wake time 30 minutes earlier every few days. If you're currently waking at 4pm, aim for 3:30pm for 2-3 days, then 3pm, and so on. This gives your body clock time to adjust.

For the actual wake-up part: As soon as your alarm goes off, immediately get up and go outside for 5-10 minutes. Natural sunlight is crucial for resetting your circadian rhythm. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is way more effective than indoor lighting.

To avoid those multi-hour naps (which are definitely sabotaging your sleep schedule), set a strict rule: no naps after 4pm, and keep them to 20 minutes max. Use an actual timer. When you feel sleepy during the day, try some light exercise, a cold shower, or stepping outside instead.

The key to making this stick is what you do before bed. Create a wind-down routine starting 1-2 hours before sleep: dim the lights, avoid screens (or use blue light filters), and do calm activities like reading or stretching. Your body needs these consistent signals that it's time to sleep.

Most importantly: be consistent with your wake time, even on weekends. A regular wake time is more important than a regular bedtime when you're trying to fix your schedule. Your body will eventually start getting naturally tired at the right time.

Remember that this process takes time - expect 2-3 weeks before it feels natural. The first week especially will be tough, but pushing through that initial discomfort is worth it for the long-term benefits you've already experienced when you managed to wake up early before.","It sounds like you're really struggling to find a rhythm that works for you, and it's great that you're acknowledging the importance of establishing a healthy sleep pattern. One thing that might be worth trying is setting a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, to help regulate your body's internal clock. It's also important to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down - this could be something as simple as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches.

Given that you've tried a lot of different alarm strategies without success, it might be helpful to focus on creating an environment that supports wakefulness, rather than relying solely on alarms. This could mean opening your curtains to let natural light in, or using a wake-up light, which simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light in your room over a set period of time.

It's also worth considering the fact that you're feeling demotivated and overwhelmed - it's possible that addressing the underlying stress and anxiety could help you feel more energized and focused. Have you thought about breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, or setting specific goals for what you want to achieve each day? Sometimes, having a clear sense of purpose and direction can make it easier to get moving in the morning.

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - developing new habits takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. It might be helpful to track your progress, not just in terms of your sleep schedule, but also in terms of how you're feeling and what you're accomplishing each day. This can help you identify patterns and make adjustments as needed. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's great that you're taking steps towards creating positive change in your life.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's awesome that you're actively trying to fix it! It's super common to struggle with sleep schedules, especially after big life changes like finishing high school.

First off, don't beat yourself up too much. It's a cycle, and recognizing it is the first step to breaking it. Since you know waking up early makes you more productive, let's focus on making that sustainable.

It sounds like you've tried some extreme methods. Maybe try something more gradual? Instead of aiming for 6 AM right away, try waking up 30 minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal. This can help your body adjust more smoothly.

Also, think about your ""sleep hygiene."" Is your room dark, quiet, and cool? Are you avoiding screens for an hour or two before bed? A consistent bedtime routine can signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Even something simple like reading a book or taking a warm bath can help.

Since coffee doesn't work, maybe try some sunlight exposure first thing in the morning. It can help regulate your circadian rhythm. Even just sitting by a window for a bit can make a difference.

Finally, about the demotivation: break down that overwhelming workload into smaller, manageable tasks. Even completing one small thing can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum. Maybe try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break).

Good luck! It takes time and consistency, but you can definitely get there.

t3_qor2kr,[Need Advice] Turned 30 recently trying to get my life back on track,"Hey all,

I turned 30 years old this year and ended up back living with my parents after going through a pit of depression about 6 years ago. In that time, I've graduated from a school in music production and am one course away from a diploma in HR which i'm still somewhat not convinced is entirely a real job lol... How do I somehow get my life together? I've been out of work for 6 months since finishing my last year of school and am super confused. I've worked a lot of entry level positions since I was 16 in retail, sales, customer service, warehouse as well as a bit of labour but never really stuck with anything for longer than 3 months to a year. I feel like I'm super arrogant as well for no reason and I just don't know how to move forward. I spent a substantial amount of time drinking and partying in university with little to no effort on school and ended up flunking out 10 years ago which was a  definitely a bit of a blow to my confidence as well as my drive/ambitions. I spent alot of my early 20's trying to pursue music and at some point that just seemed like a super unrealistic goal so I said ""screw it"" and gave it up... That's about the same time I started to get somewhat depressed. I like to think I'm not an unintelligent person and can sometimes be very resourceful but the second half of my twenties was just a big shit show and I feel like I'm trying to pick up the pieces.

To add to all that I have zero close relationships other than my parents (who are a bit fed up at this point) and zero friends at the moment after being one of the more sociable guys growing up (Maybe a bit narcissistic in hindsight) . I've let a lot of things die out in my life because I've struggled with hard work, dedication as well as forming deep relationships/moving forward. At this point, I'm thinking of going back to school for health sciences because it's really the only thing that I've been interested in the past 5 years and I've been active/lifted weights since I was about 13 years old. On the other hand I thought about going for computer science/programming because I've also played games for most of my life. Figured I could maybe make a career out of it one of those. I've also thought about going a more local community college which is in my hometown and working towards a trade certificate which would be a bit more stable even though I've never really been or worked in any trades environments. I dunno. At this point the only two people around me are my parents who give me feedback but their bottom line is to just get me out of the house asap. If you made it to the end of this you're the real MVP :). Any help would be appreciated.

TLDR: Turned 30 recently- diplomas in useless program thinking about going back to school or not really too sure how to fix my life, job and relationships.","I'm 31, and I'll tell ya, a lot of us don't have our shit together as well haha. I live part time with my parents (though, by choice), and otherwise I live abroad in different countries bc it's too expensive to live in my hometown (Bay Area).   


So #1 - give yourself some compassion and just know that we're all figuring life out one day at a time   


\#2 - Finish your HR degree, for sure. Don't give up on that. Get a job in HR for a little while and build some funds  


\#3 - During that time, work on yourself. Grace, etiquette, humility. If you have a day job, you can practice music at night or other hobbies.   


\#4 - volunteer. This one is always overlooked imho. Most people need a sense of purpose in their lives and it combats depression. Volunteering at a charity/organization for helping others will do wonders for your soul. Don't be afraid to try out several organizations. Just 2 hours per week is a good way to get your serotonin flowing  


\#5 - Give yourself a timeline of like 3 years. Don't make it 6 months, you'll set yourself up for failure. But don't give yourself 10 years either, because that'll delay some motivation. Figure out what your goals are, 3 - 5 - 10 years down the line and put your head down and get to work. There are a lot of youtube videos out there for self-improvement, so you could probably  learn about that in a weekend if you wanted to. Same with budgeting, deeper relationships, etc. Learn about them first, then put them to practice. Check in with yourself at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, etc. Once you hit a goal or are comfortable with your progress with something, add in another thing to the mix.   


Good luck!","Firstly Kudos for trying to pick up the pieces. It's not easy to do and it's great to see that you are actively trying to improve your situation.

I don't have specific advice in terms of the career you can pursue, but I have had a similar life trajectory. I messed up my 20s and ended up living with parents. Over the last year I've systematically worked to get back on my feet. My advice would be to list down all the things you need to fix, and tackle them one at a time. 

If you think you're arrogant, started fixing that part of yourself. Then systematically work towards getting a job. Once you have those things sorted, you can start meeting new people and developing friendships/relationships and so on.
Believe me it starts getting progressively easier. Just be self aware and start by fixing things one at a time.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make some changes. It sounds like you've got a lot of interests and potential paths, which is a good thing! Here’s a way to start getting things on track:

1. **Self-Reflection**: Take some time to think about what truly excites you. You mentioned health sciences and computer science/programming. Try to explore these fields a bit more—maybe take an online course or attend a workshop to see what resonates with you.

2. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, set small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as applying to a few jobs each week or dedicating a certain amount of time to learning a new skill.

3. **Routine and Structure**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for job searching, skill development, and self-care. Consistency can help build discipline and give you a sense of progress.

4. **Reconnect Socially**: Building relationships can be tough, but try to reconnect with old friends or join groups related to your interests. This can help rebuild your social network and provide support.

5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you’re feeling stuck, talking to a career counselor or therapist might provide some clarity and direction.

Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. You’ve got this!","First off - you're not alone in this situation. Many people hit 30 and need to reset their path. The good news is you've already taken some positive steps by completing education and staying physically active.

Rather than jumping straight into another degree, I'd suggest taking a more structured approach to finding your direction. Start with a 3-month plan:

Month 1: While living with your parents, commit to applying for HR positions since you're one course away from that diploma. Even if you're skeptical about the field, getting some professional experience will help you make better decisions about your next move. Apply to at least 3 jobs every weekday, and use LinkedIn to connect with HR professionals.

Month 2: While job hunting, pick ONE potential career path (health sciences, programming, or trades) and spend 2 hours each day exploring it properly. Take free online courses, talk to people in the field, and try actual work in that area. For programming, start with free resources like freeCodeCamp. For health sciences, volunteer at a local clinic or facility.

Month 3: By now, you should either have some job prospects in HR or a clearer picture of which new direction feels right. Make your decision based on this real-world experience rather than theoretical ideas.

Throughout this time, rebuild your social connections gradually. Join a gym class or local sports league - since you're already into fitness, this is a natural way to meet people while doing something you enjoy.

Remember, you don't need to have it all figured out right now. Focus on taking consistent small steps forward rather than trying to solve everything at once. The structure and stability will help lift the depression, and you'll start building momentum.","It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed with the direction of your life right now, which is completely understandable given the challenges you've faced. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to recognize the need for change and to be willing to make adjustments, so kudos to you for taking this first step. 

One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to have your entire life figured out right now, try focusing on what you can accomplish in the next week or month. This could be as simple as updating your resume, applying to a few jobs, or reaching out to someone in your desired field for advice. 

It's also great that you're considering different educational paths, such as health sciences, computer science, or a trade certificate. You might find it helpful to research each of these options more thoroughly and make a list of pros and cons for each. This can help you get a clearer sense of which direction aligns best with your interests and strengths. 

In terms of building relationships, it might be worth looking into local groups or clubs that align with your interests. This could be a great way to meet new people who share similar passions, and it might help you build some connections outside of your family. 

Lastly, try not to be too hard on yourself, okay? It's okay to not have everything figured out at 30, and it sounds like you've been through a lot in the past few years. Be patient with yourself, and remember that it's never too late to make positive changes in your life. You got this.","Hey, turning 30 can feel like a reset button, so don't beat yourself up too much about the past. It sounds like you're at a crossroads, which is totally normal.

First, about getting out of your parents' house: that's a valid goal, but don't let it pressure you into a bad decision. A stable job is key. Since you're unsure about HR, maybe put that diploma on hold.

Regarding your career options, instead of jumping straight into another degree, try some low-stakes exploration. You mentioned health sciences, programming, and trades. Could you volunteer at a clinic, take a free online coding course (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp), or shadow someone in a trade for a day? This will give you a taste without a huge commitment.

For the job search, focus on your transferable skills from those entry-level jobs. Customer service, sales, even warehouse work – they all teach valuable skills. Tailor your resume to highlight those skills for the jobs you're applying for.

As for relationships, start small. Join a local sports team, a hiking group, or a book club related to your interests. Consistent, low-pressure interaction is key to building connections.

Finally, about feeling arrogant: sometimes that's just insecurity in disguise. Focus on being genuinely curious about others and actively listening. It's a great way to build rapport and shift your perspective.

Take it one step at a time. Small, consistent actions will get you moving in the right direction. Good luck!

t3_p5ulx3,[Need Advice] Thinking about taking a gap year,"I dont think im ready for college. Ive been hardcore struggling with depression for the past couple months, im worried about being able to hold myself accountable for both keeping my grades up and paying bills, I haven’t done some pretty adult things yet like get my license or even have a working phone, etc. I was thinking of taking a gap semester or even year but I’m worried about missing my opportunity or facing these same problems again if i don’t just start now. 

I think the gap year would let me develop more as a human but im also scared im gonna stay in this state and just keep putting it off. I have passions and hobbies that i want to explore in college but something just doesn’t feel right.","I say do it. I took a gap year the summer of 2020 and it was the best thing I could have done for myself last year. I was still in school but the pandemic made me realize that I was not happy with the degree I was pursing. So I left the program and just stopped. I worked the entire time and was figuring myself out. I ended up transferring to a university that I decided about a year later.
Having some sort of plan is the key though so you don’t get too distracted. And give urself a timeline of how long you may need the rest. And there is not wrong with extending that timeline too. A year or even 2, your body and mind are the most important things.
Also remember, THERE IS NO RUSH!! You cannot compare yourself to others because you are on a different path that they are. And there is nothing wrong with that. Your journey is gonna look different from everyone else. I also recommend TheBlissBean, Lavendaire, MucheleB, and RowenaTsai. They are all on YouTube and they make content regarding to school, lifestyle, finding yourself and being more mindful in general. There is also Matt D’Avella, Ali Abdaal, Nathaniel drew, Captain Sinbad, and Thomas Frank. They are on YouTube too and offer a male perspective on mindful lifestyle, productivity, and finding your interests","I wish I had done a gap year. I was in college less than a week after high school graduation. 

Make sure you get a budget together so you can still have some money for college, or a nest fund for when you decide to get a new place, set aside. And remember that you can always decide to do something else later. I'm 31 and working on my fourth degree, which is like my 7th serious career change. 

I've also gotten depression lately and I can tell you trying to do coursework at the same time is HARD. I have been doing minimal semesters and barely passing. 

I do suggest you get a license and a working phone sooner than later though. Those are hugely helpful when you're on your own. 

Set a hard deadline for the end of the year and be sure to mark when college applications and FAFSA submissions are due and when the semester officially starts. Oh, and some colleges DO allow you to apply a full year ahead. You can always choose not to go. And you don't have to pay tuition until the drop date (when the school automatically drops people from the classes for non payment)","Taking a gap year can be a great opportunity to focus on personal growth and tackle some of the adulting tasks you mentioned, like getting your license or sorting out your phone situation. It sounds like you're aware of the challenges you might face, which is a good start. If you decide to take a gap year, try setting some specific goals for yourself. Maybe aim to achieve one or two key things each month, whether it's related to your mental health, personal development, or practical skills. This way, you can build a sense of accomplishment and keep yourself from feeling stuck. Remember, college isn't going anywhere, and taking time to prepare yourself can actually make your college experience more rewarding. Just make sure to have a plan and some structure to your time off so you can make the most of it. Good luck!","Taking a gap year can be a really smart move when you need time to build a stronger foundation. The key is having a concrete plan for that time - otherwise it's easy to stay stuck.

Here's what I'd suggest: Make a 12-month roadmap with specific goals. Start with the basics like getting your license and phone sorted in the first few months. Then add some part-time work to build financial skills and responsibility. Use the structure of a job to create daily routines and accountability.

For the depression piece, use this time to establish good habits around sleep, exercise, and getting professional help if needed. These fundamentals will serve you well whether you're in college or not.

The fear of ""putting it off forever"" is valid, but remember - a strategic pause to get yourself ready isn't the same as giving up. Set a firm timeline (like ""I'm starting fall 2024 no matter what"") and work backwards from there with monthly milestones.

College will still be there, and you'll likely get way more out of it if you're starting from a place of strength rather than struggling to keep your head above water. Just make sure you're using this time intentionally to grow and prepare, not just to avoid the challenge.","Taking a gap year can be a great opportunity for personal growth, and it's awesome that you're considering what's best for your mental health and readiness for college. It might be helpful to make a list of specific goals you'd like to achieve during your gap year, such as getting your license, setting up a budget, or exploring your passions through internships or volunteering. Having a clear plan can help you stay focused and motivated, and ensure that you're using this time to develop the skills and confidence you need to succeed in college. It's also worth considering talking to a therapist or counselor about your depression, as they can provide you with additional support and guidance during this time. Remember, taking a gap year doesn't mean you're putting off your future, it means you're prioritizing your present and setting yourself up for long-term success.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's good you're thinking proactively about this. A gap year *could* be really beneficial, but your concerns about it turning into just more procrastination are valid.

Here's my take: a gap year isn't a magic fix. It's a *tool*. To use it effectively, you need a plan. Don't just drift. If you decide to take the gap year, break down what you want to achieve. You mentioned getting your license and a phone – those are concrete goals. Make a timeline for them. Maybe license by [Date], phone by [Date].

More importantly, address the depression. Can you find a therapist or counselor to work with during this gap year? That should be priority number one. Think of it as building a foundation *before* you start building the house (college).

If you *do* decide to go to college now, don't just ignore these issues. College counseling services are often available, and you can still work on getting your license and a phone. Maybe start with one small, achievable goal each week to build momentum.

Ultimately, the ""right"" choice depends on whether you can create a structured plan for a gap year that addresses your core concerns. If you can, it might be the best thing for you. If you can't, going to college and actively seeking support might be a better option. Either way, good luck!

t3_wk4jnv,[Need Advice] I've become lazy/chill from not having a ton to do at work. How to get back into it?,"I work in finance and more specifically, I bounce around to accounts we have, help out, fill in for people on maternity/paternity leave, and do random projects. It's a rather high end job, six figures, fully remote. I've been with the company about 5 years now.

I've done new business transitions and been on some very hard, time consuming accounts. I've also worked for other companies where I put in 60+ hour work weeks regularly, had to go into the office always, etc. So I know what hard work really is.

Over the past year, I really haven't had a ton to do. My past two assignments have been very easy. Currently, my work is so automated that I work maybe a few hours a month... literally. I push a few buttons, let some VBA macros run, output files, and verify them. That's about it. These tasks typically took \~2 weeks (literally 80 hours of work) to do prior and since the automation, they take about 20 minutes now.

It feels like I've been on ""cruise control"" for over a year now. I spend the majority of my day getting up later, surfing the web, going for walks, lifting, and maybe playing a video game here and there.

My boss needed help, so I volunteered some of my time for a new account. The new assignment is over-the-top chaos, appears to be a lot of work, I have to learn a bunch of new things, etc. Because I haven't ton much over the past few months, I have zero desire to do anything work-related.

How do you flip that switch to want to learn again and do hard work? I have zero desire to really dig in and do any of it.","I’ve been in a similar situation in a similar industry. 

It’s all about perspective. Don’t look at it as flipping a switch to do hard work. Instead view it as building your reputation, legacy, helping your boss / developing that relationship. Think about what you *can* gain from this experience and focus on maximizing that.

Some additional advice. Find something you’re passionate about and the next time you’re less busy - pursue that. I’d recommend a side hustle / business that can get you paid outside your wage paying gig. Multiple income streams = security + flexibility.","Tough one. Being in a good space financially and career wise makes it seem like you have everything you've ever wanted. You've probably attained all your goals you've set for yourself up to this point? Time to set new ones? Phd?

But yes, to what end? More money? Money for the sake of money?

Maybe this is a time to start tackling world problems because you've fixed up your life and now is a time to start worrying about supporting others? But I don't know.","It sounds like you've had a pretty intense work history, and it's understandable that shifting gears back into a high-demand role feels daunting. One way to ease back into it is to start by setting small, manageable goals for yourself each day. This could be as simple as dedicating a specific block of time to learning something new related to your new assignment. You might also find it helpful to create a structured daily routine that mimics a more traditional workday, even if your workload is light. This can help re-establish a sense of discipline and focus. Additionally, try to reconnect with what initially drew you to your field. Sometimes revisiting your motivations can reignite your passion and drive. Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to colleagues or mentors for support and guidance—they can offer valuable insights and encouragement as you transition back into a more demanding role. You've got this!","It's completely normal for your work ethic to atrophy when you're not regularly challenged. Think of it like fitness - when you stop working out, getting back into it feels much harder. The good news is that you already know you're capable of handling intense workloads since you've done it before.

Start by breaking down this new chaotic assignment into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of viewing it as one overwhelming project, tackle it piece by piece. Pick one new thing to learn or implement each day. This creates a gradual ramp-up rather than trying to go from 0 to 100 overnight.

Set specific work blocks during your day - maybe 2-3 hours where you focus solely on the new project. During these blocks, use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to ease back into longer periods of concentration. You can keep your current flexible schedule for the rest of the day, but having dedicated ""deep work"" time helps rebuild that mental muscle.

Consider documenting what you learn as you go. Creating documentation or process flows not only helps you retain information better but could potentially help automate parts of this new role too. Your automation skills are clearly strong - viewing this as an opportunity to optimize another process might help spark some motivation.

Remember that growth happens outside our comfort zone. While the past year has been comfortable, taking on this challenge is an investment in keeping your skills sharp and maintaining your value to the company. Start small, be consistent, and your work ethic will bounce back stronger than before.","It's great that you're recognizing the need to get back into a more productive routine, especially with this new challenging assignment coming up. One strategy that might help is to start small and set specific, achievable goals for yourself each day. Since you've been out of the intense work mindset for a while, trying to dive back in headfirst can be overwhelming. Instead, begin by committing to short periods of focused work, like 25 minutes, followed by a short break. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique and it can help you build momentum.

Additionally, try to reconnect with why this new assignment matters to you and your career goals. What are the benefits of taking on this challenge? How will it help you grow professionally or personally? Reflecting on your motivations can help spark some enthusiasm and drive. It might also be helpful to break down the new tasks and learning requirements into smaller, manageable chunks, so it doesn't feel like an insurmountable mountain.

Remember, it's normal to feel rusty after a period of relative ease, but you've demonstrated your capability for hard work in the past. You can get back into that mindset with time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on your lack of desire right now. It's okay to take some time to adjust, and celebrating small wins along the way can help build your confidence and motivation. Good luck with your new assignment!","Okay, I get where you're coming from. It's tough to shift gears after being in cruise control for so long, especially when you know you're capable of more. Here's my take:

First, acknowledge the feeling. Don't beat yourself up for not wanting to jump into the chaos. It's natural to resist a big change after a period of ease.

Second, break down the new assignment into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of looking at the whole overwhelming project, identify the very first, smallest step you can take. Maybe it's just reading the introductory documentation for 30 minutes. The key is to make it so easy that you can't say no.

Third, focus on the ""why."" You volunteered for this, so there must have been something that initially motivated you. Reconnect with that reason. Is it the challenge? The opportunity to learn new skills? The chance to prove yourself? Reminding yourself of the potential benefits can help reignite your motivation.

Fourth, create a dedicated workspace and schedule. Even if it's just for a couple of hours each day, having a designated time and place for work can help you mentally switch into ""work mode."" Minimize distractions during this time.

Finally, reward yourself for progress. After completing a small task or working for a set amount of time, take a break and do something you enjoy. This can help create positive associations with work and make it easier to stay motivated. Good luck, you got this!

t3_ommucw,[Need Advice] How to make myself choose the harder but better choice for myself,"It's 4:40am right now on a Sunday and I'm realizing how much of a mess my life is. I gained a ton of weight in the past 3 months from working in retail to working in a bank, I have mismanaged my funds due to overeating as a coping mechanism, I buy food at the grocery that I don't eat and they end up as waste, I use Uber Eats a lot despite grocery issue, I use Uber a lot in the morning, my room is a mess, I'm a smoker, I'm pondering if buying a gaming laptop would be good for my mind, and I'm having joint and body pains from being a fat mess with an injured knee from a sports accident a year ago. 

All of these I'm aware that they may all result in my early death. I'm also aware that I can make better choices by doing the opposite of those but why can't I? Why can't I choose something that'll better myself it just doesn't make sense to me. I just want this to stop. I want to get better and be disciplined with my life.","Your mind hates uncomfortable things right now, but in the future not so much. That's called the present bias. The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the ""pain"" associated with those.

For bad habits, it will take discipline, but there are some things you can do:

As you've pointed out, bad habits are almost always coping mechanisms. So what are the emotions, events and situations that are at the root? If you can tackle even some of those, you should see less of the bad behaviour. 

Second, try to find an alternative. 

For a better understanding: smoking and eating can help deal with stress. That goes back to prehistoric times when there was often danger. If you were eating, it was because you found a safe place to do so. Even today eating or smoking send signals to your brain like ""I'm eating/chewing, so I must be safe right now"" which helps against stress.

Chewing gum would give you a similar effect but without the bad consequences.

And probably the easiest thing to start with, change your environment. What barriers can you put in place that make the bad behaviour harder to do or unpleasant? And how can you make the good choices easier to do?

It's gonna take time to break bad habits, but it should get better once you start seeing some results.","One step further: actually reward yourself. When I started running I rewarded myself with a TV show I wasn't allowing myself to watch until the run, or a chocolate protein shake (I love chocolate). Find the things you love doing in the day, and save them as rewards for doing the new habit - no matter how small the new habit is.","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Making the harder but better choice often starts with small, manageable steps. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one area to focus on first. Maybe it's reducing Uber Eats orders or setting a small budget for groceries. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what ""better"" looks like for you. Is it cooking one meal at home per day? Walking for 10 minutes? Having a tidy room? Clear goals can guide your actions.

3. **Create a Routine**: Establish a simple daily routine. It could be as basic as waking up at the same time, making your bed, or having a set time for meals. Routines can provide structure and reduce decision fatigue.

4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community (like this one!) to keep you accountable. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can make a big difference.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Change is hard, and setbacks happen. Don't beat yourself up over them. Acknowledge the slip and refocus on your goals.

Remember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","Making better choices is tough because our brains are wired to take the path of least resistance. The key isn't willpower - it's about making the better choice the easier choice through small, strategic changes.

Start with just one thing. Looking at your situation, I'd suggest tackling the food/Uber Eats cycle first since it impacts both your health and finances. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on prepping just one meal the night before work. When you're tired after your shift, you'll already have food ready - making the healthier choice the convenient one.

For the morning Uber rides, pack your work bag and lay out clothes the night before. This removes decision fatigue and makes it easier to catch regular transportation. Small prep steps like this reduce the mental friction that leads to costly convenience choices.

About the gaming laptop - hold off for now. Put that money toward clearing any food delivery debt and creating a small emergency fund. Gaming can be a great hobby, but timing matters.

The most important thing is to stop viewing discipline as an all-or-nothing proposition. You don't need to transform overnight. Pick one small change, make it stupid easy to do, and build from there. Each tiny win creates momentum for the next one.

Want a concrete first step? Tonight, take 10 minutes to prep tomorrow's lunch. That's it. One meal, one day. Then come back here and let us know how it went. Sometimes the hardest part is just starting.","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of areas in your life where you'd like to see improvement, and that's completely understandable. One strategy that might help is to focus on making one or two small changes at a time, rather than trying to tackle everything all at once. For example, you could start by committing to cook one meal at home each day using ingredients you already have, instead of ordering Uber Eats. Or, you could try setting aside 10 minutes each morning to tidy up your room and get yourself organized for the day. 

As for why it's hard to choose the better option, it's often because our brains are wired to prioritize short-term comfort and convenience over long-term benefits. But the good news is that discipline is like a muscle that can be developed over time with practice and consistency. It might help to identify the underlying reasons why you're making certain choices - for instance, are you using food as a coping mechanism because you're stressed or bored? Once you understand what's driving your behaviors, you can start working on alternative solutions that address those underlying needs.

It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now, and it's great that you're taking the first step by recognizing the changes you want to make. Consider seeking out some additional resources or support to help you on your journey - there are many books, podcasts, and online communities dedicated to helping people develop healthier habits and improve their discipline. Keep in mind that small wins can add up over time, and it's okay to celebrate those tiny victories along the way.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're recognizing these issues at 4:40 AM on a Sunday shows you've got the self-awareness to turn things around. It's great that you want to get better!

The feeling of being overwhelmed can be paralyzing, so let's break this down. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick *one* thing to focus on this week. Seriously, just one. Maybe it's cutting back on Uber Eats. Could you commit to cooking just one extra meal at home this week? Or maybe it's taking a short walk each day, even if it's just around the block, to help with the joint pain and get you moving.

Small wins build momentum. Once you've got one small habit going, you can add another. Think of it like leveling up in a game – you don't go from level 1 to level 50 overnight.

Regarding the gaming laptop, maybe hold off on that purchase for now. It sounds like you're looking for a distraction, and while gaming can be fun, it might not be the best solution for the issues you're facing. Perhaps reward yourself with it *after* you've made progress on some of your other goals.

Don't beat yourself up for past mistakes. Focus on making one better choice today, and then another one tomorrow. You got this!

t3_s1tqos,"[Need Advice] Need to decide what to focus on in life, but have too many interests. Life is so chaotic right now.","Hey Reddit,

I’ve realized that my life is so chaotic right now. I think mostly because I have so many things I want and want to do in life and because of this, multiple projects will start but no meaningful progress will have been made with any of them. I’m huge in the self development genre of literature, and am familiar with ‘The One Thing’ and focusing your energy on the tasks and goals of the main life drivers. Sometimes I feel like I can get overwhelmed even with the self improvement books. There is so much knowledge out there, I end up getting analysis paralysis, always with good intentions to make my life better, but it always ends up stressing me out and I hop from the current best thing in search of the next best thing.

As you can see things are chaotic. How do you decide what you actually want with and for your life, when there are so many things that you actually want?

What books or strategies have you found that help you the most in organizing and disciplining yourself to focus on the things that matter and make positive progress towards what you want?

Thanks in advance.",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and that's totally understandable. A good starting point might be to try the ""Essentialism"" approach by Greg McKeown. It's about focusing on what's truly important and letting go of the rest. You could start by listing all your interests and projects, then ask yourself which ones align most with your core values or long-term goals. 

Another strategy is to set a short-term experiment. Pick one interest or project to focus on for a month. This way, you can dive deep without the pressure of a long-term commitment. It might help you figure out what truly resonates with you. 

Also, consider setting boundaries on your self-improvement reading. Maybe limit it to one book at a time and give yourself space to implement what you learn before moving on to the next. Remember, it's okay to not do everything at once. Progress, not perfection, is key. Good luck!","This is a really common challenge - having too many interests can actually become paralyzing. Here's what's worked for me and others I've mentored:

Start by doing a brain dump of everything you want to pursue. Then, instead of trying to pick the ""perfect"" thing, ask yourself: ""If I could only work on one of these for the next 3 months, which would give me the most satisfaction or open up the most opportunities?""

Pick that ONE thing and commit to it for 90 days. Not forever - just 90 days of focused effort. This takes the pressure off making the ""right"" choice because you're not making a permanent decision. You're just choosing what to prioritize right now.

For managing the actual work, use time blocking. Set aside specific hours for your chosen priority. During those hours, other interests aren't allowed to interfere. Keep a ""someday maybe"" list for all your other ideas - they're not gone forever, they're just waiting their turn.

As for books, while self-improvement literature is valuable, it sounds like you might benefit from taking a break from reading new material. Instead, pick one method you've already learned about and actually implement it for those 90 days. The best system is the one you'll actually use.

Remember: You don't have to abandon your other interests permanently. You're just choosing what deserves your best energy right now. Progress in one area often creates momentum that carries over into other areas of life.

Start small, stay focused, and give yourself permission to be imperfect at everything except your current priority.","I totally get where you're coming from - it's like having too many options can be just as paralyzing as having too few. One strategy that might help is to take a step back and try to identify the common threads or themes that run through all of your interests. Are there certain values or principles that keep popping up, even if the specific projects or goals are different? For example, are you drawn to creative pursuits, or do you tend to gravitate towards things that involve helping others?

Once you have a sense of what's driving your desires, you can start to prioritize and focus on the things that align most closely with those core values. It might also be helpful to set a ""stop doing"" list, where you intentionally let go of projects or activities that aren't truly essential or fulfilling. This can help you free up mental and emotional energy to devote to the things that really matter.

In terms of books, you might find ""Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"" by Greg McKeown to be a helpful resource. It offers some practical advice on how to prioritize what's truly important and eliminate non-essential activities. Another strategy you could try is setting a ""focus period"" for yourself, where you commit to working on a single project or goal for a set amount of time (say, 30 or 60 days) before reassessing and adjusting your priorities. This can help you make progress on something meaningful without feeling overwhelmed by all the other options out there.","Hey, I totally get the feeling of being overwhelmed by too many interests and the self-improvement rabbit hole. It's like you're trying to drink from a firehose!

One thing that's helped me is to stop thinking about ""forever"" goals and start with smaller, time-boxed experiments. Instead of trying to decide the *one* thing for your *entire* life, pick 2-3 things that genuinely excite you *right now*. Then, commit to exploring each of them for, say, 30 days.

During those 30 days, dedicate a specific amount of time each week to each interest. It doesn't have to be a huge commitment – even 30 minutes a few times a week can work. The key is consistency. At the end of the 30 days, evaluate: Did you enjoy it? Did you make progress? Do you want to continue?

This approach lets you explore your interests without the pressure of making a lifelong commitment. It also helps you build momentum and see tangible results, which can be super motivating.

As for books, instead of trying to absorb everything, maybe try ""Essentialism"" by Greg McKeown. It's all about focusing on the vital few instead of the trivial many. Also, don't underestimate the power of a simple to-do list and a calendar. Schedule time for your chosen activities and treat them like appointments you can't miss. Good luck, you got this!

t3_pugd66,[Need advice] How to keep my work and personal life separate?,"How do I keep my personal and work life separate? A bad day at work often spoils my mood enough to be absent at home, no matter how hard I try. My thoughts keep going back to what happened at work and how to rectify it.
On the other hand, when I am facing some personal issues like a fight at home or when my partner is sick, I get sad enough to be distracted during work.
I often chastise myself for not being able to segregate the two. And I feel like I am the only one facing these issues. I need some advice on how I can become less sensitive towards my surroundings. And want to know if others face this issue too.",How physically active are you? When my mind is racing I find it best to get a good workout in. It will relax you.,">I often chastise myself for not being able to segregate the two. And I feel like I am the only one facing these issues.

This might be a good place to start.

What you're describing—having your home life impact how you feel at work, and vice versa—is completely normal. We are human beings, not computers. A computer can run Microsoft Excel for a while, then shut that program down completely and switch to a video game. Our human minds don't work that way. The emotions that you feel at work don't automatically shut down when you head home. And when you head to work in the morning, you can't just click ""Quit"" to turn off the emotions that you're feeling at home.

You're definitely not the only one who experiences this. A lot of people don't want to talk about it, but I'd guess that almost everyone experiences this same thing at least some of the time.

If you have a bad day at work and are still thinking about it when you get home, you might start by simply acknowledging that this is how you're feeling, and that it's totally normal. Maybe spend a couple of minutes talking to your partner about it, if that helps, just to get it out in the open and put it behind you. You might also do something that physically represents switching from work to home life, something like changing clothes or working out, something that you do every day when you get home from work.

You might try something similar if you get to work and feel distracted by personal issues. First, acknowledge that it's happening, and that it's normal. You might also create a ""start of your workday,"" routine. It could be something simple like sitting at your desk (if you work at a desk) and taking three deep breaths.

Overall, the thing that might be most helpful is to recognize that what you're experiencing is totally, completely normal, and that you're not the only person who experiences this, not by a long shot.","You're definitely not alone in feeling this way—many people struggle with separating work and personal life. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Create a Transition Ritual**: Develop a routine that signals the end of your workday and the start of your personal time. This could be as simple as a short walk, a workout, or even changing your clothes. It helps your brain switch gears.

2. **Set Boundaries**: Try to establish clear boundaries for when you're ""on"" and ""off"" work. This might mean setting specific work hours and sticking to them, or creating a dedicated workspace that you leave when you're done for the day.

3. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Practice mindfulness techniques like meditation or deep breathing to help you stay present. Reflect on your day at a set time, then consciously decide to let go of work thoughts after that.

4. **Communicate**: If personal issues are affecting your work, it might help to communicate with your partner or family about needing some time to focus. Similarly, if work is overwhelming, talk to your manager about your workload.

5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have days where things bleed over. Recognize that it's a common challenge and part of being human.

Remember, it's a process, and it takes time to build these habits. Keep experimenting with what works best for you. Good luck!","First off, you're definitely not alone in this struggle - it's completely normal to have work and personal life affect each other. Many people deal with this exact challenge.

Rather than trying to become ""less sensitive,"" which isn't really possible or healthy, let's focus on building better transitions and boundaries. Here's what works for many people:

Create a ""shutdown ritual"" at the end of your workday. This could be writing down any unfinished tasks and your plan for tomorrow, then physically closing your laptop or leaving your workspace. Think of it as closing a door on work thoughts.

For the commute home (or if working remotely, the time between work and personal life), try using that time intentionally. Listen to music, a podcast, or do some brief meditation. This acts as a buffer zone to help your mind switch gears.

When thoughts about work pop up at home, acknowledge them briefly and then gently redirect your attention. ""Yes, that happened today, but right now I'm having dinner with my family."" With practice, this gets easier.

For personal issues affecting work, set specific times to check in on situations (like texting your partner during lunch about their health) rather than letting worry consume you throughout the day.

Remember that being affected by both spheres of your life isn't a failure - it's human. The goal isn't to build an impenetrable wall between work and personal life, but to create healthy transitions that help you be more present in each moment.","You're definitely not alone in struggling to separate your work and personal life - it's a common challenge many people face. One strategy that might help is to establish a clear boundary between your work and personal time, such as changing your clothes or doing a quick workout when you get home from work to signal the transition. It can also be helpful to set aside specific times to think about work or personal issues, so you're not letting them bleed into each other throughout the day. For example, you might allow yourself 30 minutes in the morning to review your work tasks and plan your day, and then try to put work out of your mind until the next day. Similarly, if you're dealing with personal issues, you might set aside some time in the evening to think about them and make a plan for how to address them, rather than letting them distract you during work hours. It's also important to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect - everyone has bad days and gets distracted sometimes. By setting clear boundaries and being kind to yourself, you can start to feel more in control and better able to manage the overlap between your work and personal life.","Hey, you're definitely not alone in struggling with this! It's super common for work and personal life to bleed into each other. One thing that's helped me is creating clear transition rituals. For example, when leaving work, I'll listen to a specific playlist or do a quick meditation to mentally ""clock out."" At home, maybe it's changing clothes or going for a short walk before settling in.

Also, try setting boundaries around work communication. Turn off notifications after a certain time and let your colleagues know you won't be responding to emails after hours (unless it's a genuine emergency, of course).

When personal stuff is affecting work, schedule short breaks to address it. Instead of letting it simmer all day, take 10 minutes to call your partner or write down your feelings. Acknowledging it can sometimes help you compartmentalize it better.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's a process, and there will be days when it's harder than others. Don't beat yourself up about it; just keep practicing these strategies. You got this!

t3_qa4641,[Need Advice] Turned 30 recently having a hard time fixing my life,"Hey All,

Kind of looking for some advice. I just turned 30 a few months ago and I'm having a hard time moving forward/fixing my life -.-. I moved back to my hometown with my parents of about 75000 people a few years ago and haven't done much here since. I used to live in a much bigger city of about 1 million where I was doing my bachelors in geography about 10 years ago but I never ended up finishing. I have a diploma in music production which I don't do too much of anymore but I'm not really too sure what to do. Most of my childhood friends aren't around anymore or they are married with kids and I'm here just living with my parents. I do have some job experience which ranges from pizza delivery, customer service, retail, restaurant bar back, exterior painting, and a few other things from when I was much younger

I guess I'm just wondering what I should do. My parents want me to move out again at the end of the month and I'm having a hard time deciding where to go. I think I might move to a city of about 3 million people and go back to school for health sciences but I'm not too sure yet. I guess I was just wondering if anyone has had anything like this. My life really does feel like I;m kind of at the bottom of the hierarchy now even though I do have some job experience and I'm definitely not a stupid individual. I sometimes think of giving up because It would be an easy our and I sometimes have a hard time trusting others ! I'm really not a bad guy but I'm just frustrated. 

Any advice would be awesome. Thanks",,,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make some changes. It sounds like you're at a crossroads, which can be both daunting and exciting. Moving to a bigger city and going back to school for health sciences could be a solid plan, especially if it's something you're genuinely interested in. It might open up new opportunities and help you build a new network of friends and colleagues.

In terms of discipline, start by setting small, achievable goals. Maybe begin with a daily routine that includes some form of exercise, a bit of reading or learning about health sciences, and a hobby you enjoy. This can help build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment. Also, consider reaching out to any old friends or acquaintances in the new city or joining groups related to your interests. Building a support network can make a big difference.

Remember, it's okay to feel frustrated, but don't let it stop you from taking steps forward. You're not alone in feeling this way, and many people have successfully navigated similar situations. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to seek support when you need it. You've got this!","Hey there. First off, 30 is still young and you've got plenty of time to change course. The fact that you're actively thinking about your next steps and seeking advice shows you're ready to make positive changes.

Your idea about moving to a larger city and pursuing health sciences actually sounds like a solid plan. Bigger cities generally offer more opportunities, both professionally and socially. The health field is stable and growing, which could provide the structure and career progression you're looking for.

Before making the move though, I'd suggest spending the next few weeks creating a concrete action plan. Start by researching specific health science programs in your target city, their requirements, and costs. Look into housing options and job opportunities that could support you while studying. Having these details mapped out will make the transition much smoother.

In the immediate term, since you need to move out soon, consider taking a steady job (even if it's not your dream position) to build up some savings and establish stability. Your varied work experience is actually an asset here - it shows adaptability and people skills.

Don't get too caught up comparing yourself to others. Everyone's path is different, and plenty of successful people have had major life redirections around your age. Focus on taking small, consistent steps forward each day. Start with the basics - setting a regular sleep schedule, maintaining a budget, and working on your school applications.

Remember that rebuilding takes time, but each positive choice moves you in the right direction. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging you want change and seeking guidance. Now it's just about breaking down your goals into manageable actions and tackling them one at a time.","Hey, happy belated 30th birthday! It's completely normal to feel stuck, especially after hitting a milestone like that. First, let's acknowledge that you've had a variety of job experiences, which is actually a great foundation to build upon. It might not seem like it right now, but having tried different fields can help you identify what you enjoy and what you're good at.

It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost because your life isn't where you thought it'd be at 30, and that's okay. Many people feel this way, even if they don't talk about it openly. Considering going back to school for health sciences is a great idea - it could give you a sense of direction and purpose. However, before making any big decisions, take some time to reflect on what you want to achieve in the next few years. What are your priorities? What kind of lifestyle do you want to have?

As for moving to a new city, it could be a great opportunity for a fresh start, but make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Are you running away from your current situation or are you genuinely excited about the possibilities a new city can offer? Weigh the pros and cons, and consider visiting the city before making a decision.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. You've got a good support system with your parents (even if they're nudging you to move out), and you've got job experience under your belt. It's not about being at the ""bottom of the hierarchy"" - it's about taking small steps towards building the life you want. Don't give up! You've got this. What do you think is the smallest, most achievable step you can take today to move closer to your goals?","Hey man, turning 30 can definitely feel like a crossroads, so you're not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you're at a point where you get to actively choose your next chapter, which is both daunting and exciting.

First, about moving out: a city of 3 million for health sciences sounds like a solid plan if you're genuinely interested in that field. Think about shadowing someone in that area or taking an intro course online to test the waters before committing. Don't feel pressured to decide immediately; maybe a smaller city with more affordable options could be a good stepping stone.

As for feeling ""at the bottom,"" remember that everyone's timeline is different. Your past experiences, even the pizza delivery and painting, have built skills like responsibility and work ethic. Those are valuable! Instead of focusing on where you *think* you should be, focus on small, consistent steps forward.

Since you mentioned music production, is there any way to rekindle that passion, even as a hobby? Sometimes reconnecting with something you enjoy can boost your overall motivation.

Finally, about trusting others: it's okay to be cautious. Start small. Join a club or group related to your interests and build connections gradually. Having a support system, even a small one, can make a huge difference.

Don't give up! Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate small wins. You've got this.

I need a career change, because my current job is just not it anymore. I've been out of school for so long, I don't know how to study anymore. I have one year untill I start and would like to start practicing ""studying"" now so I don't get burned out in the first semester.

Any tips?",Read Deep Work by Cal Newport. Great book on how to study. Borrow from the library. Worth buying as well. Or download free pdf from pdfdrive dot net.,"I know it seems pretty obvious, but for me, studying two weeks ahead really helps in the long run. When you are ahead, you can afford to take breaks, be sick or whatever, without getting left behind by the piles of homework. And if you are behind, catch up!!! I have made that mistake before, and i was so behind that it was impossible to catch up, because i kept delaying it. And because of that, i had to restart my programme.
Best of luck!","Going back to school after a long break can be daunting, but it's great that you're planning ahead! Start by setting a consistent study schedule, even if it's just an hour a day. This will help you build the habit gradually. Try using the Pomodoro Technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It can help maintain focus and prevent burnout. Also, explore different study methods like active recall and spaced repetition to see what works best for you. Lastly, consider joining study groups or online forums related to your field of study to stay motivated and engaged. You've got a year to prepare, so take it step by step, and you'll be ready when classes start!","Kudos on planning ahead for your return to school! Starting to build study habits a year in advance is a really smart move. Here's what worked well for me and many others:

Start small - pick one subject you're interested in and dedicate 30 minutes each day to learning about it. This could be through free online courses, textbooks, or educational videos. The specific subject matters less than building the routine of focused learning time.

Create a dedicated study space at home, even if it's just a corner of a table. Having a consistent spot helps train your brain to focus when you sit down there. Keep it clean and organized, with good lighting and minimal distractions.

Try the Pomodoro technique - study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This helps prevent burnout and makes the process less daunting. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the study intervals.

Practice active recall rather than passive reading. Take notes, summarize key points in your own words, and try explaining concepts out loud. This engages your brain more effectively than just highlighting text.

Consider joining a study group or finding an accountability partner, even before starting school. Local libraries often have adult learning groups, or you could connect with other returning students online.

Remember - you're not starting from zero. Your work experience has taught you valuable skills like time management and problem-solving. Those will definitely help in your academic journey.

Start implementing these habits now, and by the time classes begin, studying will feel much more natural. You've got this!","It's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to prepare yourself for going back to school. Developing study habits takes time and practice, so it's excellent that you're giving yourself a year to get into a routine. One thing you could start doing now is setting aside a dedicated time each day or week to read and learn something new, even if it's just for 15-30 minutes. This could be reading books related to your desired field, taking online courses, or watching educational videos. The key is to create a habit of consistent learning and reviewing material. You might also consider starting a journal or log to track your progress, note what works for you, and identify areas where you need improvement. Additionally, you could try reaching out to current students or professors in your desired program to get a better understanding of what to expect and how to prepare. Remember, the goal is to build gradually, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - just focus on making progress and adjusting your approach as needed.","Hey, that's awesome you're going back to school! It's totally understandable to feel a bit rusty after being out for so long. A year is a great runway to get back into the swing of things.

Instead of jumping straight into ""studying,"" maybe start by focusing on building a routine. Pick a subject you're interested in (doesn't even have to be related to your future studies) and dedicate a small amount of time to it each day – even 15-20 minutes. Consistency is key here. Think of it like warming up a muscle.

Experiment with different learning methods. Try reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, or even just having discussions with people about the topic. See what clicks for you. Also, find a study environment that works. Library, coffee shop, quiet corner at home – experiment and see what helps you focus.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes or feel like you're not getting it right away. It's all part of the process. The goal is to build the habit of learning and get comfortable with the feeling of being a student again. Good luck, you got this!

t3_oqoask,[NEED ADVICE] I can't focus 'cause I wait for text back.,"I've been with a guy for more than a year now. The thing, in short is that I have developed a habit of replying not too late to him since we started talking and I do expect the same in return, which sometimes he fails to do and that's okay.

When he doesn't reply me for a long time due to some reason I tend to wait for the text (not actively). It's like my subconscious mind is always waiting for the text back.

It really messes up my things as in the back of my mind I keep waiting for the text even tho i know that the reply is not important and eventually he will text me back.

So, how can I focus on my work instead of the text.
I really think I made it a habit (of waiting, leaving my things and replying).

How can I make myself understand that my work is more important than that.

Any advice?",arrange time to call him and call him after you're done working. a 1 hour call is far better than 4 hour texting,"Imagine you've already received the text back and it's friendly or flirty or loving or whatever you want it to be. How does it *feel* in your body when you imagine that? Perhaps satisfied, content, fulfilled, happy, at ease, etc.

Next time you are waiting to hear back, repeat this 30 second exercise. Close your eyes, imagine you *already* received the text back and it's positive, and then sink into that comforting, relaxing feeling.","It sounds like you're dealing with a common issue where our brains get stuck in a loop of anticipation. One thing that might help is setting specific times to check your messages, like every hour or two, instead of constantly being on alert. This way, you can train your mind to focus on your tasks in between those times. Also, try to engage in activities that require your full attention, like reading or exercising, to break the habit of waiting. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own time and work. Over time, this practice can help you build the discipline to focus on what's important to you. Good luck!","This is a really common struggle in the smartphone era, but there are practical ways to regain your focus. First, try putting your phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" mode while you work. You can customize DND settings to allow calls from specific people in case of emergencies, but texts won't create notifications to distract you.

Set specific times to check and respond to messages - maybe once every few hours during breaks. This creates healthy boundaries and trains both your mind and your partner to expect responses at reasonable intervals rather than immediately.

A good way to reinforce this is to keep your phone in another room while working. The physical distance makes it much harder to fall into the checking habit. If you need your phone nearby, try putting it in a drawer or somewhere out of sight.

Remember that responding instantly isn't actually helping your relationship - quality time and attention are much more valuable than quick replies. By focusing on your work and personal growth, you're bringing your best self to the relationship too.

Start small - try 30-minute focused work sessions where you completely ignore your phone. As this gets easier, gradually increase the duration. Your brain will adjust to these new patterns, and the urge to check messages will decrease over time.

The key is consistency in whatever system you choose. Pick an approach that feels doable and stick with it for at least a couple weeks. Your work deserves your full attention, and with practice, you can absolutely break this habit.","It sounds like you've fallen into a pattern of expectation and anticipation that's affecting your focus. One strategy that might help is to set a specific ""check-in"" time with your phone, say every hour or two, where you allow yourself to check for messages. Outside of those times, try to keep your phone on silent or out of sight to reduce the constant mental checking. This can help you break the habit of constantly waiting for a response and free up mental space for your work. Additionally, when you do catch yourself mind-wandering to the text, gently acknowledge it and refocus on your task at hand - don't beat yourself up over it, just recognize the pattern and try to shift back to what's important. It might also be helpful to have an open conversation with your partner about your communication expectations and boundaries, so you both are on the same page. Remember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing greater focus and discipline.","Hey, I get it. That feeling of waiting for a text can totally derail your focus. It sounds like you've identified the core issue: you've unintentionally trained yourself to prioritize his texts. Here's a couple of things that might help:

First, try scheduling specific times to check your phone. Maybe every hour or two. Outside of those times, put your phone on silent and out of sight. This creates a boundary and helps you regain control of your attention.

Second, when you notice yourself thinking about the text, actively redirect your thoughts. Acknowledge the thought (""Okay, I'm thinking about his text""), then consciously shift your focus back to your work. It's like training a muscle – the more you do it, the easier it gets.

Third, make your work more engaging. If you're finding it hard to focus, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Reward yourself after completing each task. This can help create a positive association with your work and make it more appealing than waiting for a text.

Finally, remember that your time and focus are valuable. You're not being unreasonable by prioritizing your own goals. Good luck!

t3_p0hwln,[Need Advice] How to handle multiple classes/courses simultaneously during the Semester?,I had problems handling multiple courses previous semester and I think that handling 6 classes and learning 3 new software in the upcoming semester will burn me out. Does anyone know how can I improve my workflow or any resources?,,,"Handling multiple classes and learning new software can definitely feel overwhelming, but with some planning and discipline, you can manage it effectively. Start by organizing your schedule with a planner or digital calendar. Block out time for each class, study sessions, and software practice. Prioritize tasks by deadlines and difficulty, and break them into smaller, manageable chunks. Consider using the Pomodoro Technique to maintain focus and avoid burnout—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to professors or classmates if you're struggling; they can offer valuable insights or resources. Lastly, make sure to schedule downtime to recharge. Balance is key to maintaining productivity and avoiding burnout. You've got this!","Managing 6 classes plus learning new software is definitely challenging, but there are several strategies that can help you stay on top of everything without burning out.

First, time blocking will be your best friend. At the start of each week, map out specific chunks of time for each class and software learning. This prevents the overwhelming feeling of trying to juggle everything at once. For example, dedicate mornings to your most challenging classes and afternoons to learning the software.

A key tip is to break down software learning into small, manageable chunks. Instead of trying to master all 3 programs at once, focus on learning the essential features of each one first. You can gradually build up to more advanced features as the semester progresses.

For your classes, create a priority system. Not all classes need equal time and attention. Figure out which ones are most demanding or important for your major, and allocate your energy accordingly. Use a planner or digital calendar to track assignment due dates across all classes - this helps prevent anything from falling through the cracks.

One effective method is the ""2-1-2"" approach: Study two subjects deeply on Monday, another one on Tuesday, and two more on Wednesday, then repeat. This rotation helps maintain steady progress across all courses while preventing information overload.

Remember to schedule short breaks between study sessions. Taking 10-15 minutes to reset between subjects can actually improve your productivity and help prevent burnout. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) works great for this.

You've got this - it's just a matter of smart planning and consistent execution.","Handling multiple classes and learning new software can be overwhelming, but with a solid plan, you can manage your workload effectively. One strategy is to create a master schedule that outlines all your classes, assignments, and study sessions. Set specific times for learning each software, and break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Prioritize your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, focusing on urgent vs. important tasks. Consider implementing the Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25-minute focused work sessions followed by a 5-minute break, to help you stay concentrated. Additionally, explore resources like calendars, planners, or apps like Trello or Notion to organize your workflow. It might also be helpful to reach out to your professors or teaching assistants for guidance on managing coursework and to discuss any potential flexibility with assignments. Lastly, don't forget to schedule time for self-care and relaxation to avoid burnout – it's just as important as your academic commitments.","Okay, that sounds like a lot! It's totally understandable you're worried about burnout. Here's my take:

First, break it down. Don't look at it as ""6 classes + 3 software."" Think of each class and each software as individual projects with deadlines. Write *everything* down – assignments, readings, software tutorials, everything. Use a planner (digital or paper, whatever works for you) and put in due dates, but also break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.

Second, time blocking is your friend. Allocate specific times for specific tasks. Be realistic! Don't schedule 4 hours of coding if you know you'll only focus for 2. Include breaks! Short, frequent breaks are better than long, infrequent ones. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) can be really helpful.

Third, prioritize ruthlessly. What's due first? What's worth the most points? What's the hardest? Tackle the most important stuff when you're freshest. Don't get bogged down in the easy stuff and then run out of energy for the challenging tasks.

Fourth, don't be afraid to say no (or at least, not *everything* yes). If you're already overloaded, avoid taking on extra commitments. Your mental health is important.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're learning a lot, and it's okay to struggle. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Just learn from them and keep moving forward. Good luck!

Accountability partner will be helpful","you have to be open to hold yourself accountable. there are obvious reasons to why you've relapsed that only you know of. therapy is helpful, and I'd recommend it to everyone, but it only works when you realize you're the only one capable of changing yourself and the path your life is on. at the end of the day, this is your life. you have control over how you react to it.",Can you say it in layman's term ? Lol,"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. First off, remember that setbacks are part of the journey, and it's okay to ask for help. Here are a few things that might help you regain control:

1. **Small Steps**: Start with small, manageable goals. Instead of trying to quit everything at once, focus on reducing your usage gradually. Celebrate each small victory to build momentum.

2. **Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes activities you enjoy and that keep you busy. This can help reduce the time and energy you have to engage in your addiction.

3. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness or meditation to help manage intrusive thoughts. Apps like Headspace or Calm can be a good starting point.

4. **Accountability**: Since you mentioned wanting an accountability partner, consider joining a support group or finding someone who can check in with you regularly. This can be a friend, family member, or even someone from an online community.

5. **Professional Help**: If you haven't already, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction. They can provide personalized strategies and support.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and reaching out is a strong first step. Keep pushing forward, and take care of yourself.","Hey there. First, know that recognizing and wanting to address your internet addiction is already a huge step. The fact that you managed to control it before shows you absolutely have the capability to do it again.

For building mental strength during this process, start really small. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, set specific times during the day when you'll stay offline - maybe just 30 minutes at first. Use this time to develop alternative coping strategies: go for a walk, do some basic exercises, read a book, or practice deep breathing. The key is having go-to activities ready for when those intrusive thoughts hit.

Since you've been using the internet as a comfort mechanism since age 12, it's natural that breaking away feels extremely challenging. Consider downloading an app blocker to help create boundaries - Forest is a good one that gamifies staying off your phone. 

For the depression and intrusive thoughts, it would be worth talking to a mental health professional who specializes in addiction. They can provide proper tools and strategies specific to your situation. In the meantime, try journaling when those thoughts come up - it helps get them out of your head and onto paper.

I'd be happy to be an accountability partner. Feel free to DM me and we can set up a check-in system that works for both of us. Sometimes just knowing someone else is rooting for you can make a big difference.

Remember - recovery isn't linear. You've beaten this before, and you can absolutely do it again. Take it one day at a time, celebrate small wins, and be patient with yourself as you rebuild healthier habits.","It's great that you're recognizing your struggles and seeking help. First, congratulations on managing to control your addiction for about a year - that's a huge achievement. It's also important to acknowledge that setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process. 

To start with, it might be helpful to break down your goal into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, try setting a daily or weekly goal for reducing your internet usage. You can use tools like website blockers or apps that track and limit your screen time to help you stay on track.

In terms of dealing with intrusive thoughts, it might be helpful to practice some mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help you learn to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them. You could also try journaling or talking to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling.

Having an accountability partner can be really helpful, so that's a great idea. You might consider joining a support group, either online or in-person, where you can connect with others who are going through similar struggles. 

Remember that overcoming addiction and building mental strength is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be kind to yourself and don't give up, even when it feels like things are getting tough. You've already shown that you're capable of making progress, and with the right support and strategies, you can get back on track.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's awesome that you're reaching out. Relapses happen, and the fact that you were able to control your addiction for a year shows you have the strength to do it again. Don't let this setback define you.

First, those intrusive thoughts are rough. It might be worth exploring some techniques to manage them. Things like mindfulness, meditation, or even just writing them down can sometimes help lessen their power. There are some great free apps out there for guided meditations.

As for getting mentally strong, start small. Trying to overhaul everything at once when you're feeling depressed is a recipe for overwhelm. Pick *one* tiny, achievable goal related to breaking the addiction. Maybe it's just limiting your internet use to a specific time each day, or finding a new hobby to replace some of that time. Celebrate those small wins – they build momentum.

Since you mentioned you've used the internet as a comfort since you were young, maybe try to identify what need it's fulfilling. Are you looking for connection, distraction, or something else? Once you know that, you can start exploring healthier ways to meet those needs.

Finding an accountability partner is a great idea. Maybe post again specifically looking for someone in a similar situation, or check out some online support groups. Knowing someone else is in your corner can make a huge difference. You've got this!

t3_olcivn,21 and lost [need advice],"Hello I’m armando, I’m 21 and don’t know what the fuck is going on in life. I was mentally abused my whole life and had a horrible childhood. Very poor, single mother household (mostly), counted how many places we had to live before I was 20, 25 places I’ve lived, probably more I just don’t remember all of them. I let my moms opinions ruin everything I’ve ever done. I have ptsd, Bi polar, depression, anxiety. It literally runs my life. Sometimes I feel suicidal for days at a time. Depression has been the normal mood since 14. I used weed and porn to cope with my shitty existence. I “attempted” suicide twice, honestly didn’t think I as gonna live past 16. 
  Here I am, 21 years old with no dreams or ambitions other than to stay alive. I did 1 year of community college, but I don’t know What I want from life. Just moved 2 hours away in may. Still don’t have a “real job”. I’ve been doing Uber eats to get by, I feel like my brain is mush and I’m just roughting away. I feel so old (I know I’m not old but I’ve been cooking and doing my own laundry since like eight years old I had to be the dad of the house ok) I’m tired of thinking/feeling this way. I just want to live already, I know i have a good life to live I’ve just been dealt shit. I’m a hard worker with no motivation. I still feel suicidal, but I know I can’t kill myself now. Is it weird that I feel like being alive and wanting to live is a burden? Wish i could just die and leave this planet.
 Thank you for listening to my tedtalk","Go to my YouTube lol but seriously… way to go for being here after ALL that! If you’ve made it this far there’s nothing you can’t do. Head up my brother, allow your mind and heart to rest, try to find better ways to cope than self-destructing habits. Right now your number 1 thing is to re-parent yourself… give yourself all the love and attention and appropriate care you did not receive… things will turn around, God is with you and I’m sending you love and prayers, reach out if you need to talk. 

Xo","I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life, I just turns 22 last month. Everyday I wake up to the same abusive brain. Hearing your story really puts it into perspective how good I’ve had it, and I’m sure there’s stories out there where you can find empathy and go wow, maybe it’s not so bad myself. You have a head that wants to kill you, don’t listen to it. Fitness was my liberation, using my body. Maybe trying something new in your free time can help, or starting something old that you enjoy. Don’t think, just do more. There isn’t a cure for this disease of ours, but their is a solution. I realised every day I felt like shit because what the fuck did I do in that day but sit around, complain and feel sorry for myself. Motherfucker, I need to earn my happiness every, single, day. I need to apply treatment everyday or else I get soft, and my brain goes wild. Treatment being I need to work, workout, or do something I’m passionate about. I need to grind. Build your self worth.

I don’t know if this outlook is for everyone, but the way I see it nothing really matters in the best way possible. We are so insignificant in the timeline of human beings, I doubt my casual existence will be remembered in history. This is amazing for me, liberating. I know my depression doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, my fuckups don’t matter, what colour top I wear doesn’t matter. Obviously you can go to the full extent and go bad with this train of thought, hurt people and yourself, or you can use it to liberate yourself. What matters is how I perceive myself, and I know the truth is I can’t trust my brain. People seem to like me, I think I’m ok at some things like computer games. I know deep down under those first thoughts of Self hatred, I have it in me.

Don’t live in the past, that’s depressing. Don’t live in the future, that’s anxiety. Just do what u can do right now. It’s not about the harvest you reap, it’s about the seeds you plant. You have it in you brother, hard working and you sound like a good person. Very admirable for someone whose had a hard life. You feel old because you are wise and have had a very big dose of ‘life’ at an early age. It’s ok mate, you are not doomed. If you ever need to talk, feel free to hit me up.","Hey Armando, first off, I want to say that it's really brave of you to share your story. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable to feel lost. You're not alone in this, and there are steps you can take to start feeling more in control of your life.

Start small. It might sound cliché, but building discipline begins with tiny, manageable steps. Pick one thing you want to improve or change, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a hobby or exercise. The key is consistency, not perfection.

Consider reaching out for professional help if you haven't already. Therapy can be a game-changer, especially when dealing with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. There are also support groups and resources that can help you feel less isolated.

As for finding direction, it's okay not to have everything figured out at 21. Try exploring different interests or skills, even if it's just for fun. Sometimes, new experiences can spark unexpected passions or career ideas.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help and lean on others. You're not a burden, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels tough. You've already shown incredible resilience, and that strength will help you build a life you want to live.","Hey Armando - first off, you're incredibly strong for making it this far despite everything you've been through. Moving away and supporting yourself through Uber Eats shows you've got grit, even if it doesn't feel that way right now.

Let's focus on small steps to help you move forward. Your brain isn't mush - it's been in survival mode for a long time and needs some structure to thrive. Start with one tiny routine each day, like making your bed or taking a 10-minute walk. These small wins build momentum.

For finding direction, try this: spend 30 minutes each morning writing down anything that sparks even slight interest. Could be random stuff like ""I enjoy talking to delivery customers"" or ""That one psychology class was cool."" Do this for two weeks without judgment. Patterns will emerge that can point toward potential paths.

The community college experience is valuable - you've proven you can handle coursework. Consider taking just one class next semester in something that catches your eye. Many trade programs also offer short certificates that can lead to stable careers.

Most importantly, please reach out to a counselor or therapist. Many offer sliding scale payments, and some community health centers provide free services. You deserve professional support in processing your past while building your future.

You've already shown incredible resilience. Now it's time to shift from survival mode to building the life you want, one small step at a time. Keep checking in here - this community has your back.","Armando, thanks for sharing your story with us - it takes a lot of courage to be so open about the struggles you're facing. First off, let's acknowledge that you've made it through some incredibly tough circumstances, and that in itself is something to be proud of. It's understandable that you feel lost and unsure about what you want from life right now, especially given everything you've been through. 

One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to figure out your entire life's purpose, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable goals. What are some things you enjoy doing, or things you've always wanted to try? It could be something as simple as taking a different route on your Uber Eats deliveries, or trying out a new hobby in your free time. Having something to look forward to, no matter how small it seems, can help build momentum and motivation.

It's also really important that you're recognizing the coping mechanisms you've been using (like weed and porn) might not be serving you well in the long run. That takes a lot of self-awareness, and it's a great first step towards making some positive changes. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the trauma and mental health struggles you're facing? It might be really helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and guidance as you navigate all this.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel like being alive is a burden sometimes - especially when you've been dealing with as much pain and hardship as you have. But here's the thing: you're still here, and that means you've got a chance to create a different future for yourself. It might not feel like it right now, but you do have the strength to get through this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep taking things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't figure everything out overnight. You got this, Armando.","Hey Armando, that sounds like a really tough journey so far, and it takes guts to share all that. It's definitely not weird to feel like living is a burden when you've been through so much. A lot of people feel that way sometimes.

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but also like you're ready for a change, which is huge. Since you're feeling unmotivated but know you're a hard worker, maybe try breaking things down into super small, manageable steps. Instead of thinking about a ""real job,"" could you spend 30 minutes a day just browsing job postings or updating your resume? Even that small action can build momentum.

Also, since you mentioned past trauma and mental health struggles, are you currently seeing a therapist or psychiatrist? If not, that could be a really valuable step. Even if it feels overwhelming to find one, there are online options and resources that can help you connect with someone. Taking care of your mental health is the foundation for everything else.

As for feeling like your brain is mush, maybe try incorporating some simple brain-boosting activities. Even 15 minutes of reading, doing a puzzle, or learning something new online could help you feel more engaged.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself to figure everything out at once. Focus on small, consistent actions that move you in a positive direction. You've already survived a lot, and you're capable of building a better future for yourself.

t3_1005h9f,"[Need Advice] What does your daily schedule look like (including weekends)? Just trying to get a sense on how to organize the day to be most productive… Would like to include exercise, studying, pleasure reading, housework, and volunteer work, and still have time for family.",It helps me to see what others are doing and create my own schedule based upon others’ successes.,Thx in advance for the ideas!,,"Creating a balanced schedule that includes all those activities can be challenging, but it's definitely doable with some planning. Here's a general approach that might help:

1. **Prioritize**: Start by listing all the activities you want to include and rank them by importance. This will help you allocate time more effectively.

2. **Time Blocking**: Dedicate specific blocks of time to each activity. For example, you might exercise in the morning, study in the afternoon, and do housework in the evening. This helps create a routine and ensures you’re not neglecting any area.

3. **Flexibility**: While having a schedule is great, life happens. Allow some flexibility for unexpected events or changes, especially on weekends.

4. **Combine Activities**: Look for ways to combine activities. For instance, you could listen to audiobooks while doing housework or go for a family walk as part of your exercise routine.

5. **Review and Adjust**: At the end of each week, review what worked and what didn’t. Adjust your schedule accordingly to improve balance and productivity.

Remember, the goal is to create a sustainable routine that works for you, so feel free to tweak it as needed. Good luck!","Here's my typical schedule that helps me balance productivity with life - hopefully it gives you some ideas to work with!

Weekdays:
5:30am - Wake up, quick meditation
6:00-7:00am - Exercise (alternating cardio/strength)
7:00-8:00am - Shower, breakfast, prep for day
8:00-12:00pm - Most productive work/study hours
12:00-1:00pm - Lunch break, short walk
1:00-5:00pm - More work/study
5:00-6:00pm - House tasks, meal prep
6:00-8:00pm - Family time, dinner
8:00-9:00pm - Reading, light chores
9:30pm - Wind down routine
10:00pm - Sleep

Weekends are more flexible but I keep the same wake/sleep times. I batch most housework and meal prep on Saturday mornings, do volunteer work Saturday afternoons (2-3 hours), and keep Sundays mainly for family, hobbies and planning the week ahead.

The key is being realistic - you won't fit everything in perfectly every day. I rotate priorities throughout the week (e.g. deeper cleaning on weekends, different study topics on different days). Start with your non-negotiables (sleep, exercise, key work hours) and build around those. Track what works for a few weeks and adjust. Your ideal schedule will look different than mine, but having a consistent framework really helps build those habits.","I've found that having a balanced daily schedule is key to staying productive and disciplined. For me, it starts with prioritizing the most important tasks, like exercise and studying, early in the morning. I try to wake up around 6:00 AM, get in a workout, and then dedicate a few hours to focused study or work. After that, I make time for household chores and volunteer work, usually in the late morning or early afternoon. The evenings are reserved for pleasure reading and spending time with family - it's essential to have that downtime to recharge. On weekends, I try to maintain some consistency with my weekday routine, but also leave room for flexibility and relaxation. One thing that's helped me is using a planner or calendar to block out dedicated time for each activity, including self-care and leisure. It might take some experimentation to find the right balance, but seeing how others structure their day can definitely provide inspiration. What specific areas of your life are you struggling to schedule, and maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together?","Hey! It's awesome you're looking to build a more structured day. It's definitely a juggling act to fit everything in, but totally doable.

Instead of trying to copy someone else's schedule exactly, I'd suggest starting by tracking your time for a few days. Just write down what you do and when. This will give you a realistic picture of where your time actually goes. You might be surprised!

Then, prioritize. What are the non-negotiables? Family time, maybe a certain amount of studying? Block those out first. Next, think about when you're most energetic for different tasks. Are you a morning person who can knock out exercise before work? Or do you prefer reading before bed?

Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one or two things to focus on each week. Maybe this week it's just getting in 30 minutes of exercise three times. Next week, add in 30 minutes of pleasure reading. Small, consistent changes are way more sustainable than trying to do everything perfectly from day one.

Finally, be realistic and flexible. Life happens! Some days you'll nail your schedule, and other days you won't. The key is to just keep showing up and making progress. Good luck!

t3_x5oxom,[Need Advice] How do I control myself from buying unnecessary things and improve my spending habits?,Idk if this is the right sub but I have trouble controlling my spending habits. Every time I have money I always spend it to buy unnecessary things because it made me feel good. Idk why but shopping is just satisfying and I just can’t help it. I think it’s just me coping with my negative feelings like whenever I feel sad or mad at someone because these are the times I usually decided to get something for myself to feel better. It made me feel good for a moment until I realised that I’ve spent a lot of money and could have saved it for something more important. Can anyone help and give me tips on how to control myself? How do I become more responsible and save money?,"Every time you want to buy something, add it to the list. And then keep adding things to the list as you think of things to buy. I don't actually buy them though. And then eventually you'll realize that these things have been on the list for a really long time but you never really needed them so you'll be fine. You can do this thing where you just don't spend any money for a month called No buy month",get yourself into severe debt,"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with some emotional spending, which is super common. Here are a few tips that might help you get a handle on it:

1. **Awareness**: Start by tracking your spending. Use an app or a simple notebook to jot down every purchase. This will help you see patterns and understand where your money is going.

2. **Budgeting**: Set a budget for yourself. Allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending each month. Once you hit that limit, try to hold off on more purchases.

3. **Delay Gratification**: When you feel the urge to buy something, wait 24 hours before making the purchase. This can help you determine if you really need it or if it's just an impulse buy.

4. **Find Alternatives**: Since shopping is a way to cope with negative feelings, try to find other activities that make you feel good. This could be exercising, reading, or even just going for a walk.

5. **Set Goals**: Think about what you want to save for. Having a clear goal can make it easier to resist unnecessary purchases because you know your money is going towards something important.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself as you work on building better habits. You've got this!","Thanks for being open about your spending habits - recognizing the pattern is an important first step. What you're describing sounds like emotional spending, and there are practical ways to get it under control.

Start by creating a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before any non-essential purchase. When you feel the urge to buy something, add it to a wishlist instead of your cart. After 24 hours, you'll often find the emotional trigger has passed and you no longer want the item.

For immediate help managing impulse buys, delete shopping apps from your phone and unsubscribe from promotional emails. These constant reminders and easy-access shopping make it much harder to break the habit.

Set up automatic transfers to move money into a separate savings account as soon as you get paid. This creates a psychological barrier - you'll think twice before moving money back to spend it. Even starting with a small amount helps build the saving habit.

When you feel those negative emotions coming on, have alternative activities ready that don't involve spending. Could be going for a walk, calling a friend, working out, or any hobby that gives you a similar mood boost. The key is breaking the automatic link between feeling bad and shopping.

Track your spending for a month in detail. Sometimes seeing the real numbers in black and white can be eye-opening and motivating. Use this to create a realistic budget that includes some ""fun money"" - being too restrictive often backfires.

Remember that changing financial habits takes time. Focus on progress rather than perfection, and be proud of each small win along the way.","It sounds like you're using shopping as a way to cope with negative emotions, which is a pretty common phenomenon. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - in your case, it seems like feeling sad or mad at someone can set you off. When you feel those emotions coming on, try to pause and do something else instead of reaching for your wallet. This could be going for a walk, calling a friend, or doing some exercise - anything that can help distract you from the urge to shop. 

Another thing you might find helpful is to implement a 30-day rule: when you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before actually making the purchase. This can help you figure out if the item is something you really need or if the desire to buy it was just an impulsive want. You could also try setting up a budget and prioritizing your spending - make a list of what you need to save for, and see if you can allocate your money towards those goals instead of impulse purchases.

It might also be helpful to find other ways to cope with your emotions that don't involve spending money. Could you try journaling, meditation, or talking to a therapist? These can be really powerful tools for managing negative feelings without breaking the bank. Remember, developing self-control and better spending habits takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't get too discouraged if you slip up - just acknowledge the setback and keep moving forward.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to use shopping as a way to cope, but it definitely sounds like you're ready to make a change.

First, try to identify your triggers. You mentioned feeling sad or mad – keep a little journal for a week or two and jot down what you're feeling right before you get the urge to shop. Recognizing those feelings is the first step.

Next, create some friction. Unsubscribe from marketing emails, delete shopping apps from your phone, and maybe even avoid going to the mall if that's a trigger. The harder it is to shop impulsively, the better.

Also, try to find healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of shopping when you're feeling down, try going for a walk, listening to music, or talking to a friend. It might not give you the same immediate rush, but it'll be better for you in the long run.

Finally, set some financial goals. Having a specific reason to save money (like a vacation, a new car, or just a safety net) can make it easier to resist impulse buys. Maybe even create a separate savings account specifically for that goal and track your progress. You got this!

t3_t0mi6z,[Need Advice] How are you supposed to do EVERYTHING?!,"How are you supposed to study, and work, and spend time with your family, and learn a musical instruments, and clean the house, and cook, and read books, and watch movies, and buy groceries, and workout, and ....

this is not a complain or anything. I'm generally interested in how is it possible to live like this...
like I really want to study, and I do want to work, and also I want to learn piano, and so on...
but it just doesn't seem possible. either there's not enough time, or I forget, or I'm to tired from one task that I just wanna go to sleep or ...

so how does someone go about living like this? how can you do everything? 


im 22, I've been trying to turn my life around for the past year. I have done many things I'm proud of since last year. I got way more productive than I ever was.
But here's the thing, whatever I do, it doesn't seem like I can manage to do everything I want to....","Random Advice:  get a Slow cooker and a rice cooker. You can go out to work or stuff come back and food is ready. 

I still have no idea how people do so many things. Work takes the majority of my time but I still want to go back to school and do many other things too!","This is the way, particularly with new habits.

Write a list of things you would like to do/ do more of, prioritise it, then start adding things into your schedule slowly.

15 mins every day doing one new thing. Once you have done that for a couple of weeks you can think about adding the next thing.

That said, don’t stress over not doing all things you want to all at the same time - there are going to be times that you don’t have time to practice piano, or cook, or whatever and that’s fine.

I go through phases of being at the gym 5 days a week, and phases when work gets in the way and it is only once a week, and that’s fine because I can get back on it the following week. 

Be persistent at trying to be consistent. You haven’t failed until you stop trying.","Hey there! It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's great that you're motivated to do so many things. The key here is to prioritize and manage your time effectively. Start by identifying your top priorities—what's most important to you right now? Focus on those and be okay with not doing everything at once. It's also helpful to create a schedule or routine that includes time for rest and relaxation. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly, but about making consistent progress. You might also want to try habit stacking, where you pair a new habit with an existing one, to make it easier to incorporate into your day. Lastly, don't forget to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. You're already doing great by being more productive than before, so keep building on that!","The short answer is: you're not supposed to do everything, at least not all at once. And that's totally okay.

Think of your time and energy like currency - you have a limited amount to spend each day. Just like you can't buy everything in a store at once, you can't do all activities simultaneously. The key is prioritizing what matters most right now.

At 22, you're already ahead of the curve by thinking about this. The fact that you've made progress over the past year shows you're on the right track. Now it's time to be strategic.

Pick 2-3 main priorities for this season of your life. Maybe that's work, studying, and family time. Focus on those first. Then choose 1-2 smaller activities that bring you joy (like piano) and schedule them in smaller chunks. 15-30 minutes of focused practice is better than no practice at all.

As you get better at managing your core priorities, you'll naturally find ways to fit in other activities. Some things might need to wait until you have more time or energy - and that's perfectly fine. Life is long, and you don't need to master everything right now.

Remember that successful people aren't doing everything every day. They're doing a few important things consistently well. Start there, and build gradually. You've already proven you can make positive changes - now it's just about being selective with what you tackle next.","I totally get where you're coming from - it can feel overwhelming when you have a long list of things you want to accomplish. The key is to realize that you don't have to do everything at once, and that prioritization is crucial. Instead of trying to fit in every single activity, try to identify your top 3-4 non-negotiables - the things that are most important to you, like studying, working, and spending time with family. Once you've got those covered, you can start allocating smaller chunks of time to other activities, like learning piano or reading. It's also important to learn to say no to things that aren't essential, and to leave some buffer time in your schedule for rest and relaxation. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly - it's about making progress and being consistent. You've already made some great strides in the past year, so keep building on that momentum! One strategy you might find helpful is the ""Eisenhower Matrix"" - it helps you categorize tasks into urgent vs important, and focus on the most critical ones first. Maybe give that a try and see how it works for you.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It feels like there's never enough time in the day, right? The truth is, you probably *can't* do absolutely everything. And that's okay! The key is prioritization and being realistic.

First, acknowledge that you're already making progress. You said you've become more productive, which is awesome! Build on that momentum.

Instead of trying to do everything at once, try focusing on a few key areas. What are the 2-3 things that would make the biggest difference in your life right now? Maybe it's studying and working, or learning piano and working out. Focus on those first.

Then, break those down into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of ""learn piano,"" it's ""practice piano for 15 minutes, 3 times a week."" Instead of ""workout,"" it's ""go for a 30-minute walk on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.""

Also, be honest with yourself about what you *actually* enjoy. Maybe watching movies isn't as important as reading books, or vice versa. Don't feel pressured to do things just because you think you *should*.

Finally, remember to schedule in rest and downtime. You can't pour from an empty cup. If you're constantly running on fumes, you'll burn out quickly. Even 15-20 minutes of relaxation each day can make a huge difference.

It's a marathon, not a sprint. Keep experimenting, keep adjusting, and be kind to yourself along the way. You got this!

t3_xgqh0u,"[Need Advice] Feeling lonely, demotivated & stagnant","I am 30 year old. I work as a software Engineer in a service based IT company. Due to pandemic I have been living at my hometown (a small town) since about 2 years. So my social life is totally down. Just before the pandemic my girlfriend broke up withme & moved to a different countryfor higher studies. 

I had graduated in Electronics engineering but because of lack of awareness & fearing of missing out, I took up a job in IT as I didn't want to waste a year. Because of that rush & bad decision, I couldn't pursue a master's degree in my field. And now, after 7 years, my job is getting on my nerves. Though it pays decent salary, the pressure & responsibility keeps increasing. I have to keep learning new tech & certification Tobe relevant. 

I have symptoms of ADHD too which is why my decision making & motivation has been on low. I am shorter than average height in boys which is why I have always faced criticism & comments since childhood which led to my under confidence. Right now, almost every friend of mine is married and they are all busy in their lives. Some of my cousins are doing much better than I am. They are travelling foreign countries, getting masters degree from good colleges, earning good, have a companion, making babies etc while here I am, living alone doing 9-10 hours work each day only to wake up next day with a sad face. There's also a constant subconscious pressure of working on the code to meet sprint deadlines.  the challenges get more difficult. 

It seems even my parents have stopped caring. When I try to talk to them they don't even reply properly, they listen to me & say nothing more than ""everything is/will be fine"". 

I have no motivation to get up & work 9-8. Sleep. Get up work again. No one to talk to. I get no calls or messages anymore. Rarely a friend calls, talks formally. That's all. 

I don't know where to start. I feel depressed & crippled. Any advice or help or motivation will be","Sorry to hear this bro. How you feel determines what you think. And what you think determines how you feel. Both are interlinked and you will have to with on both. 

Think good to yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be a friend to yourself. Accept your mistakes. Understand everyone makes them. Don't be too harsh or berate yourself over it.

Focus to change yourself. Slowly but surely. Take small but consistent steps to a better you. Start eating well. On time. Healthy food. Get up an hour early. Excercise. Go for walks daily. Atleast an hour. Or better still join a gym. Read some good books. Readily suggest Atomic habits by James Clear. Or Awaken the giant within or Unlimited Power by Anthony Robbins. Borrow from a library or buy a copy online. It is a good investment.","Understand Bro. You are on the way. 30-45 days streak is good. The problems happen when we ""listen"" to the negative voice in our head. You can tell it to get lost. Refute it. Argue why you are a winner. Act like one.  Re. Loneliness, you need to work on relationship angle as well. Just post your profile on Shaadi dot com. Be bold. Put your photograph as well. You will be surprised to know how good a response you will get. Few people I know have met their life partnersbthru Shaadi.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. First, know that it's okay to feel this way, and you're not alone. Many people have faced similar challenges and found a way through.

Start small to regain some control and build momentum. Consider setting a simple daily routine that includes a few non-work activities you enjoy or want to try. This could be a short walk, reading a book, or even learning something new online that interests you. These small steps can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.

Connecting with others, even virtually, can also make a big difference. Try reaching out to old friends or joining online communities related to your interests. It might feel awkward at first, but it can help rebuild your social life and provide some support.

Regarding your career, it's never too late to pivot or explore new opportunities. Reflect on what you truly enjoy and consider taking small steps towards that path, whether it's through online courses or networking with people in that field.

Lastly, if you're feeling persistently low, it might be helpful to talk to a professional who can provide guidance tailored to your situation. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as any other aspect of your life. You've got this, and things can get better with time and effort.","Hey there. Your situation sounds really challenging, but it's good that you're reaching out. Let's break this down into manageable pieces you can actually work on.

First, the isolation needs to be addressed. Since you're working remotely, you'll need to be proactive about creating social connections. Consider joining local meetup groups or sports clubs - even in a small town, there are usually some activities happening. If tech meetups aren't available locally, start with virtual ones. This gives you both social interaction and professional networking.

For your career situation - you're not as stuck as you might think. Many electronics engineers transition into embedded systems or IoT roles, which could blend your original degree with your current IT experience. Start exploring these hybrid roles. They often offer better work-life balance and could feel more meaningful to you.

The daily grind becomes more manageable when you have something to work towards. Set aside 30 minutes each morning (before work) to work on a personal project or study something you're genuinely interested in. This gives you a sense of progress outside of work deadlines.

For the immediate term, create a simple evening routine. Go for a 20-minute walk after work, do some basic exercises, and try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Physical movement helps clear your head and improves sleep quality, which directly impacts motivation.

Don't compare yourself to others' timelines. Instead, focus on small, daily improvements. Start tracking these improvements - whether it's learning something new, making a new connection, or just maintaining your routine. Small wins build momentum.

Remember that seeking professional help for ADHD is a perfectly valid step - proper support could make a significant difference in your daily functioning and decision-making.

Take it one day at a time. Focus on building one good habit this week. Then add another next week. It's not about massive changes - it's about consistent, small steps forward.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed right now. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, especially given the significant changes and challenges you've faced in recent years. It's great that you're recognizing your struggles with ADHD and how it affects your motivation and decision-making - that's a big step.

One thing that might help is to break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to tackle everything at once, try focusing on one area of your life that you'd like to improve. For example, you could start by setting aside some time each day to work on a personal project or hobby that brings you joy. This could be anything from learning a new programming language to working on a creative project.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that help you relax and reduce stress. Exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature can all be great ways to improve your mood and energy levels. Since you mentioned feeling lonely, you might consider joining online communities or forums related to your interests - this could be a good way to connect with others who share your passions.

In terms of your career, it might be helpful to explore ways to make your current job more engaging or fulfilling. Could you talk to your manager about taking on new challenges or responsibilities? Or, you could start looking into other job opportunities that might be a better fit for your skills and interests.

Lastly, don't give up on reaching out to your friends and family, even if it feels like they're not responding the way you'd like. It's possible that they're busy or struggling with their own issues, but that doesn't mean they don't care about you. Keep trying to connect with them, and consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide you with additional support and guidance.

Remember, getting your life back on track takes time and effort, but it's worth it. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging your struggles and reaching out for help - now it's time to start making small changes and working towards a more fulfilling life.","Hey, that sounds like a really tough spot to be in, and it's understandable you're feeling this way. It's easy to get caught in a rut when things feel stagnant.

First, it sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure from different areas. Let's break it down. You mentioned ADHD symptoms – have you ever been officially diagnosed? If not, getting an assessment could be a game-changer. Understanding how your brain works can unlock strategies for managing focus and motivation. Even without a diagnosis, look into ADHD-friendly productivity techniques like breaking tasks into smaller steps, using timers (Pomodoro), and minimizing distractions.

Regarding your career, it's great that you recognize the need to keep learning. Instead of viewing it as a burden, could you reframe it as an opportunity? Maybe pick one area that genuinely interests you, even if it's slightly outside your current role, and dedicate a small amount of time each week to learning it. Even 30 minutes a day can make a difference and give you a sense of progress.

Socially, it's tough when everyone else seems to be on a different path. Instead of comparing yourself to your cousins, focus on building your own connections. Since you're in your hometown, are there any local groups or activities you could join based on your interests? Even something small like a hiking club or a volunteer organization can help you meet new people. If that's not an option, try reconnecting with old friends online, even if it's just a quick message to say hello.

Finally, about your parents, it's frustrating when you don't feel heard. They might not know how to help, so try being specific about what you need. Instead of saying ""I'm feeling down,"" try ""I'd really appreciate it if we could talk about my career for a bit.""

Start small. Pick one thing from above and focus on it for a week. Celebrate small wins. You've got this.

t3_x26v62,[Need Advice] How do I get out of a rut?,"I have been in a rut for about 6 months now (maybe even more) and I have been doing the bare minimum in everything. I stopped going to the gym and all I do everyday is sit at home, play video games, watch meaningless youtube videos, and succumb to a pornography addiction that I have been trying to fight off for a while now.

I am in my last year of university and need to take a graduate exam to move onto masters and because of this I quit my job to dedicate more hours to studying. This was 3 months ago and I have barely studied at all. And all the hours that I should be using to study are being wasted on the things I mentioned above.

Every time I make a promise to myself to complete a task or plan out my day to meet certain goals I always end up doing nothing. As a result of this, I stopped believing the promises I make to myself because I'll just end up sitting on the couch doing nothing either way. And even if I go two days while being productive I will always end up relapsing back into my rut on the third day, and if not the third day, then surely the fourth, or fifth, and so on. I can never be consistent at anything. My attention span and focus is probably less than an insect's. I do not respect myself and lack confidence and even if I come forward to talk about my struggles with a friend they never take me serious and ALWAYS misunderstand me.","Try maybe very small. One easy task a day. Then two tasks, and so on, until you find a balance that works for you.","What you might need is better clarity. Rather than setting up end goals try to break down all the task into bits and pieces. What I'm trying to say is have every step clear in your mind, strategize everything like it's a war you must win. Maybe write things down, every detail about how you are gonna study. How you are gonna tackle every part, be extremely practical and know your limits. Don't put too much expectations and stop planning out things roughly. Being specific will bring more clarity. As you start being productive into studying you can now slowly start adding workouts into your routine. When one thing is sorted and you feel productive other things would get back on track on their own.","Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out for advice is a great first step. Here are a few things you might try to help get out of this rut:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small habit to change. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 10 minutes of study or going for a short walk each day. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Limit your time on video games and YouTube. Use apps or tools to block these distractions during study hours. This can help you focus on what you need to do.

3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for study, exercise, and relaxation. Consistency can help you regain control over your day.

4. **Accountability**: Find a study buddy or someone you trust to check in with regularly. Sharing your goals with someone else can help keep you accountable.

5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have setbacks. What's important is getting back on track. Celebrate your small victories and don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as planned.

6. **Professional Help**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You've got this!","First off - you're not alone in this struggle. Many people hit similar ruts, especially during important transition periods like preparing for grad school. The good news is that you're aware of the patterns and actively seeking change.

Let's start small. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick ONE thing to focus on for the next week. Given your grad exam priority, I'd suggest starting with studying. Set a ridiculously easy goal - like studying for just 25 minutes each morning. That's it. Don't worry about the gym or other habits yet.

The key is rebuilding trust with yourself through small wins. When you consistently hit that 25-minute target, you'll start believing in your own promises again. Use the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. During those 25 minutes, put your phone in another room and block distracting websites.

For the gaming and YouTube habits - don't try to quit cold turkey. Instead, make them rewards. After completing your study session, give yourself permission to play for a set amount of time. This helps break the cycle of guilt and creates positive reinforcement.

Regarding consistency - forget about perfect streaks. If you miss a day, just pick up where you left off the next morning. Think of it like GPS navigation - when you take a wrong turn, it doesn't berate you, it just recalculates the route.

Consider finding an accountability partner - maybe another student preparing for grad exams. Sometimes external accountability can help bridge the gap while rebuilding self-trust.

Remember: progress isn't linear. Focus on taking small, consistent steps rather than massive changes. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging the situation and seeking help. Now it's time for that 25-minute study session.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and struggling to break out of some negative patterns. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well, so kudos to you for recognizing your issues and seeking help. 

One thing that might be helpful is to start small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire routine at once, try setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. This could be something as simple as studying for 10 minutes, or going for a short walk outside. The idea is to build momentum and start to rebuild your sense of self-efficacy.

It's also important to recognize that consistency is not an all-or-nothing thing. Just because you have a setback on the third or fourth day doesn't mean you've failed. It means you're human, and you're going to have ups and downs. The key is to learn from those setbacks and keep moving forward.

In terms of your studying, you might find it helpful to create a schedule and stick to it, at least for a few hours a day. Break your study sessions into smaller chunks, and take regular breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing. This can help make the process feel less overwhelming.

Lastly, don't give up on talking to friends about your struggles. It's possible that they're not taking you seriously because they don't understand what you're going through, but that doesn't mean you should stop reaching out. You might consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and supportive space to discuss your issues.

Remember, getting out of a rut takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't expect to change everything overnight. You got this, and you can start making progress one small step at a time.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out is a great first step. It's super common to feel this way, especially with the pressure of grad school looming.

First, be kind to yourself. You're not alone in struggling with consistency. Instead of aiming for huge changes, try micro-wins. Seriously, tiny steps. Like, instead of ""study for 8 hours,"" aim for 15 minutes. Set a timer, no distractions. When it goes off, you're done. You can always do another 15 later if you feel up to it. The goal is to break the inertia.

Regarding the other habits, try replacing instead of just stopping. If you're reaching for the video games, have a book or a quick workout ready to go instead. Even just 10 push-ups can shift your focus. For the pornography addiction, there are some great subreddits and resources out there (I can't link them here, but a quick search will find them) that offer support and strategies.

As for your friends not taking you seriously, that's frustrating. Maybe try framing it differently, like ""Hey, I'm really trying to make some changes, and I'd appreciate it if you could just listen without judgment."" If they still don't get it, maybe find a study buddy or online community where people are working towards similar goals.

The key is to build momentum with small, achievable goals. Don't beat yourself up when you slip up – just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You've got this!

t3_yzepya,[Need Advice] Help me find a good habit tracker,"Hello! I've been trying out different habit trackers but struggle to find one that fits my needs.

I would like it to have most or all of the following functions:

- be able to add both one-time tasks and habit chains

- be able to add subtasks and -goals

- be able to add non-tracked tasks and appointments

- be able to set a deadline for tasks with reminder notifications and graphics (such as bright red text) for when a task is near its deadline

- be able to use the app as a calendar

- be able to use images or imagery

- that it has widgets

- that it works on Android


So far I've enjoyed Fabulous for habit formation. Its imagery depicting a journey really works for me. Unfortunately it's only for habits, not tasks. I really would prefer not to have to use several apps for this.

I recently found HabitNow that comes really close to what I'm looking for, but I find its graphics uninspiring and tasks only show up in the daily list if you don't assign a deadline for some reason. Also, you can only get reminders on the day of the deadline and not before, which is lacking for me.

Ideally the app would show a list of items each day like the following example:


Tuesday

Pay rent (monthly task, this day at the top and in bright red because deadline is next day)

Floss (habit tracking)

Go to the gym (also habit tracking) 

Movie night (one time task, set on this specific day) 

Buy a new umbrella (another one time task, set to show up as a reminder every day until it is completed)


I am aware that what I'm looking for might not exist, but I'm very appreciative of any suggestions!",I really like Daylio.,"Seem like a nice app, thanks for the suggestion! Unfortunately there's only habit formation, no tasks, so it doesn't do it for me.","Hey there! Finding the perfect habit tracker can be a bit of a quest, but it sounds like you have a clear idea of what you need. Based on your requirements, you might want to check out ""TickTick."" It’s a versatile app that combines task management with habit tracking and has a calendar view. You can set deadlines, reminders, and even use widgets. It also works on Android and allows for subtasks and goals. While it might not have the same journey-style imagery as Fabulous, it’s pretty customizable, so you might be able to tweak it to make it more visually appealing for you. Another option could be ""Todoist,"" which is great for task management and has some habit tracking features. It’s not as visually driven, but it’s very functional and might meet most of your needs. Good luck, and I hope you find the right fit!","Thanks for the detailed breakdown of what you're looking for! Based on your requirements, I'd recommend checking out TickTick. It hits most of your criteria - you can track both habits and one-time tasks, set subtasks, use it as a calendar, and get customizable reminders before deadlines. The interface includes visual elements and widgets for Android, though not quite as journey-focused as Fabulous.

Another solid option worth considering is Microsoft To Do. While it's not primarily marketed as a habit tracker, you can create recurring tasks for habits, set due dates with advance reminders, and organize everything with subtasks. The interface is clean and it handles your example scenario really well.

If you're willing to try something a bit different, Notion can be customized to do everything you've described. There's more of a learning curve, but you can design it exactly how you want, including adding whatever images and visual elements motivate you most. The mobile app works well on Android and you can create widgets.

The key is finding a system that you'll actually stick with long-term. Even a slightly imperfect tool that you use consistently will serve you better than a ""perfect"" one that feels like a chore. Maybe try one of these for a couple weeks and see how it fits into your routine?","You're looking for an all-in-one habit tracker and task manager that's both functional and visually appealing. I totally get why you'd want to avoid using multiple apps. Have you considered checking out Todoist or Trello? Both have Android apps and offer a wide range of features, including the ability to add one-time tasks, habit chains, subtasks, and goals. They also allow you to set deadlines with reminder notifications and use calendars to organize your tasks. Todoist has a more traditional task management approach, while Trello uses a board-based system that might appeal to you if you like visualizing your tasks. Additionally, you could look into Any.do or TickTick, which offer similar features and have customizable widgets. As for the graphics and imagery, some of these apps allow you to add images or customize the appearance, so it might be worth exploring their settings to see if you can make them more inspiring. It's also worth noting that you could try using a digital planner or bullet journal app like Evernote or OneNote, which offer a lot of flexibility in terms of customization and organization. I'd love to hear if any of these options resonate with you, or if you've already tried them and are looking for something else!","Hey! Finding the right habit tracker can be a real pain, so I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've put in some solid effort already.

Since you like the visual journey aspect of Fabulous, maybe you could try pairing it with a separate task manager that handles the more complex scheduling and reminders you need. It might not be ideal to use two apps, but if Fabulous really motivates you for habit formation, it could be worth it.

For the task manager, have you looked into TickTick? It's available on Android, has pretty robust task management features (subtasks, deadlines, reminders), and a calendar view. I'm not sure about the exact level of visual customization you're looking for, but it does offer some theming options and widgets. You can definitely set recurring tasks and one-off tasks with specific deadlines and reminders.

Another option to consider is Todoist. It's also available on Android and has a lot of the features you mentioned, including subtasks, deadlines, and reminders. It might not be as visually driven as Fabulous, but it's a solid choice for managing tasks and projects.

Ultimately, the best app is the one you'll actually use consistently. Maybe try a free trial of TickTick or Todoist and see if they click for you. Good luck with your search!

t3_u66lyr,[Need Advice] I feel like a waste of space,"Ever since I started college (2020) I’ve been a total waste of space. I procrastinate on every assignment, spend all day every day mindlessly scrolling or watching Netflix, overeat constantly, avoid making friends and struggle to get out of bed. I want to blame it on mental health issues (I’m very anxious around people and in general), but I know that won’t help me overcome it. I constantly feel exhausted, overwhelmed or like nothing matters. 
I have great parents, a good support system, am set financially, have a great relationship and am paying to see a therapist as well as taking antidepressants. There is no logical reason for me to be this way. And yet no matter how many times I’ve tried to pull myself out of it over the past two years, I keep falling into my old patterns. I’m starting to worry that I’ll never amount to anything and I’ll disappoint everyone who has been there for me. 
Am I the worst person ever? How do get better?",,,"Hey there! First off, you're definitely not the worst person ever. It's great that you're reaching out and looking for ways to improve. It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, which is something many of us go through, especially with the added stress of college and everything else going on.

One thing that might help is starting small. Pick one habit you want to change and focus on that. For example, if you want to cut down on mindless scrolling, set a timer for 30 minutes of screen-free time and gradually increase it. Celebrate those small wins because they add up over time.

Also, try to establish a simple daily routine. It doesn't have to be anything major—just a few things you do every day, like making your bed or going for a short walk. Routines can provide a sense of stability and accomplishment.

Since you're already seeing a therapist, maybe discuss these goals with them. They can offer personalized strategies and support. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep moving forward. You've got this!","First off - you're not the worst person ever. Not even close. What you're describing is actually really common, especially for college students who started during the pandemic. The transition to college is tough enough without throwing a global crisis into the mix.

The good news is you're already taking positive steps by seeing a therapist and getting treatment. That shows you're willing to work on yourself, which is huge.

Let's start small. Instead of trying to fix everything at once, pick ONE tiny habit to build. Maybe it's making your bed right when you wake up, or walking outside for 5 minutes each morning, or reading one page of a book before bed. The key is to make it so small it feels almost laughably easy.

Once you've got that first tiny habit locked in (give it 2 weeks), add another small one. The momentum builds naturally. When you start seeing yourself as someone who follows through on small commitments, the bigger ones become less daunting.

For the procrastination specifically - try the 5-minute rule. Tell yourself you only have to work on something for 5 minutes. Usually once you start, continuing isn't as hard as you imagined. If after 5 minutes you still want to stop, that's fine - you still succeeded by starting.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect. It's about getting back up when you slip. Each day is a new chance to take a small step forward. You've got support systems in place and you're asking for help - those are strengths, not weaknesses. Keep building on them, one tiny habit at a time.","It sounds like you're really struggling with self-discipline and feeling stuck in a rut. First, let's acknowledge that having a good support system, financial stability, and access to therapy are all huge advantages - it's great that you have these resources available to you. Now, rather than beating yourself up over your habits, try to focus on making small, incremental changes. For example, start by committing to one productive task per day, like doing a load of laundry or working on an assignment for 25 minutes without any distractions. As you build momentum, you can gradually increase the duration and intensity of your efforts. It might also be helpful to set specific, achievable goals for yourself, like attending a certain number of social events per week or cooking healthy meals a few times a week. Remember that developing discipline is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. By making tiny changes and celebrating your small wins, you can start to build confidence and develop healthier habits. And hey, it's not about being the ""worst person ever"" - it's about recognizing that you have the capacity for growth and improvement, and taking steps towards becoming the best version of yourself.","Hey, you're definitely not the worst person ever. College is a huge transition, and it sounds like you're dealing with a lot. It's great that you're already in therapy and on antidepressants – that's a solid foundation.

It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle, and breaking that cycle is tough, but totally doable. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, try focusing on one small, manageable change. Since you mentioned struggling to get out of bed, maybe that's a good place to start. Could you set your alarm just 15 minutes earlier and use that time to do something you enjoy, like listening to a favorite song or stretching?

Procrastination is a big one too. Instead of thinking about the entire assignment, break it down into tiny, achievable steps. Can you commit to just working on it for 15 minutes? Often, once you get started, it's easier to keep going. If not, that's okay, you still did 15 minutes.

Also, be kind to yourself. You're already putting in the effort by seeking help and recognizing the problem. Progress isn't always linear, and there will be setbacks. The important thing is to keep trying and celebrate the small wins along the way. You've got this!

I procrastinate things till last minute or start after a deadline. I know I can work better if I take things slow and properly prepare but instead waste my time. I am really bad at time management too. I need help.","I would begin by learning about procrastination and how it works. You're fighting blind if you don't comprehend what you're up against.   


The fact that procrastination is a consequence of ineffective emotional regulation can point you in the right direction.","One possible solution is that don't start with some upheaval task or don't try to finish a task at once. Tell yourself that you're gonna spend only 40 mins on this and no more even if you have really gotten into the rythm. This is because it will help your mind to condition it in a way that you'll think no matter how horrible a task is you won't spend more than 40 mins at a time. Do this with pretty much every task. Whether you love or hate it. Allot it 40 mins or any short period of time and don't extend no matter what.

So you just need to fight that resistance. A lot of times if you're able to fight that resistance you realise that this task wasn't as tough as you thought it'd be. 

Also fear can drive people. Be fearful and really force your mind to think the consequences so that you can induce a visceral emotion in yourself about the consequences or the embarrassment you might have to face. 

Also have some hobby(small or big doesn't matter) that you can look forward to. That can help you to keep going when thinks get tough. You'll think that once you're done with all the crap you can spend some time on that and enjoy yourself. Hope this was helpful!","Hey there! It sounds like you’ve got a lot on your plate, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here’s a simple approach that might help:

1. **Break it Down**: Start by breaking your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This can make them feel less daunting and easier to tackle.

2. **Prioritize**: Identify what’s most urgent and important. Focus on completing those tasks first. This can help reduce the stress of looming deadlines.

3. **Set a Timer**: Use the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make tasks feel less overwhelming.

4. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes specific times for work, study, and house chores. Consistency can help improve time management.

5. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize it. This could be social media, TV, or even certain environments.

6. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, it’s okay to struggle sometimes. Progress is progress, no matter how small. Celebrate your wins, even the little ones.

You’ve got this! Just take it one step at a time. 😊","Hey there - I totally get the challenge of balancing housework responsibilities with everything else. The good news is that procrastination and time management are skills we can improve with the right approach.

Start by breaking down your tasks into really small chunks. Instead of ""do assignment,"" try ""write introduction paragraph"" or ""research 3 sources."" For housework, maybe ""clean kitchen counter"" rather than ""clean kitchen."" These smaller tasks feel way more manageable.

A technique that might help is the ""2-minute rule"" - if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This builds momentum and prevents small tasks from piling up. For bigger tasks, try working in 25-minute focused blocks (Pomodoro technique), then take a 5-minute break.

Since you mentioned having 1-2 hours of housework, try to establish a consistent time for it. Maybe right after breakfast or before dinner. This creates routine and removes the mental burden of deciding when to do it.

For deadlines, use a simple calendar or task list (digital or paper) and work backwards. If an assignment is due Friday, mark mini-deadlines: research by Tuesday, rough draft by Wednesday, etc. This prevents that last-minute rush.

Remember - you don't need to transform overnight. Pick one small change to implement this week. Maybe it's the 2-minute rule, or setting mini-deadlines. Build from there. You've already taken the first step by recognizing what needs to change.","It sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation, especially with the added responsibility of housework on top of your other tasks. One thing that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and then schedule them into your day. This can make it feel less overwhelming and allow you to focus on one thing at a time. For example, you could allocate specific times for housework, work, and study, and try to stick to those times as much as possible. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like ""I will work on this task for 25 minutes without any distractions,"" and then take a short break before coming back to it. This can help you build momentum and make progress without feeling too overwhelmed. Additionally, you might consider talking to your family about your workload and seeing if there's a way to distribute the housework more evenly, or find ways to make it more efficient so it takes up less of your time. Remember that developing better time management skills takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't give up - you can get better at this with consistent effort.","Hey, I get it, deadlines can be brutal, especially when you're juggling family responsibilities too. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's totally understandable.

One thing that might help is breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have to write this whole paper,"" try ""I'm going to spend 30 minutes outlining the introduction."" Even small progress can build momentum.

Also, try to schedule your housework and study time. Even if it's just blocking out specific hours in a planner or using a time management app, it can help you visualize your day and make sure you're allocating time for everything. Maybe you can even find ways to make housework a little less dreadful – listen to a podcast or music while you're doing it?

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's easy to beat yourself up for procrastinating, but that just makes things worse. Acknowledge that you're struggling, and then focus on taking one small step forward. You got this!

t3_zll6dd,[Need advice] how to give yourself a deadline and take it seriously?,"I usually work great if I have a deadline imposed by someone else. Even for assignments with not so strict deadlines, it still pushed me to turn in my work on time. Now that I don't have someone giving me a deadline, I can't seem to get work done unless I force myself to. How can I give myself a deadline and take it seriously? I read about owing someone money or having it donated to a charity if you don't finish on time but, that is something I don't have an interest in. Any advice is appreciated.","Set up a gmail account for Mr Smith.

Mr Smith is now your boss. Mr Smith will be emailing you with your tasks and deadlines. If you don't make a deadline you need to explain yourself to Mr Smith and what you are going to do to prevent that happening again.

You will also be the one sending Mr Smith's emails setting the tasks.","I think the book ""Better than before "" talks about how people are different in their motivations and gives techniques for your type (needing external motivation).","One approach you might find helpful is to create a system of accountability that works for you. Try setting up a regular check-in with a friend or colleague where you share your goals and deadlines. Knowing that someone else is aware of your timeline can add a layer of pressure similar to external deadlines. You could also use tools like calendar reminders or project management apps to break your tasks into smaller, manageable parts with mini-deadlines. This can make the overall deadline feel more tangible and less overwhelming. Lastly, reward yourself for meeting your deadlines. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something that makes you look forward to completing your task. Over time, this can help reinforce the habit of taking your self-imposed deadlines seriously.","External accountability is a powerful motivator, and it's totally normal to struggle with self-imposed deadlines. Here's what's worked really well for me and others: get an accountability partner. Find a friend, family member, or colleague who can check in on your progress. Set clear deadlines with them and schedule regular check-ins. The key is making it official - actually put it in both of your calendars and treat it like any other important commitment.

Another effective approach is breaking down your work into smaller chunks with mini-deadlines. Instead of one big deadline that feels distant and abstract, create a schedule with specific milestones. For example, if you're working on a project, decide ""I'll complete the outline by Wednesday, first draft by Friday"" etc.

You can also try time-blocking your calendar. Actually schedule your tasks like appointments with yourself. This creates structure and makes the deadlines feel more concrete. Plus, seeing the blocked time serves as a visual reminder of your commitments.

The most important thing is to start small. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one project or task, set up your accountability system, and build from there. As you successfully meet these self-imposed deadlines, you'll develop more trust in yourself and your ability to follow through.","One strategy you could try is creating a schedule with specific, achievable milestones and sharing it with a friend or accountability partner. This way, you're still holding yourself accountable to someone, even if it's not a traditional authority figure. You can also try setting up a reward system for yourself when you meet your deadlines - this could be something small like taking a break to watch a movie or going for a walk. The key is to make the deadline feel more tangible and consequential, so it doesn't just feel like a arbitrary goal you've set for yourself. Another approach might be to focus on building a consistent daily routine, rather than just focusing on the end deadline. By making progress every day, you can create a sense of momentum that helps carry you through to the finish line. Ultimately, it's about finding a system that works for you and your motivations, so don't be afraid to experiment and try out different approaches until you find one that sticks.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's way easier to meet deadlines when someone else sets them! Since the money/charity thing isn't your style, here are a few other ideas that might help:

First, try breaking down your work into smaller, super-specific tasks. Instead of ""Work on project,"" make it ""Write intro paragraph"" or ""Find 3 sources."" Smaller tasks feel less overwhelming and easier to start. Give each of those mini-tasks a deadline.

Second, make your deadlines public, even if it's just to a friend or family member. Tell them, ""Hey, I'm aiming to finish X by Friday. Can you check in with me?"" Knowing someone else is expecting you to deliver can add some pressure.

Third, experiment with timeboxing. Block out specific times in your day for working on your project and treat those blocks like unbreakable appointments. Even if you don't feel like it, sit down and work during that time. You might be surprised how much you get done.

Finally, reward yourself when you meet a deadline! It doesn't have to be anything huge, but a little treat can help reinforce the behavior. Good luck!

t3_se5nrl,[Advice] I can't eat the 3000 calories I need every day to add mass muscle and I need advice,"I'm a guy who has generally always been insecure about his body because I was always so skinny. In fact, my low self-esteem from being skinny made me miss out on a lot of opportunities in general and I even stopped going to the beach with my friends because I looked humiliating (or that's what I thought). 

Now, I'm not so skinny anymore and I've started to build my self-esteem because I've met amazing people in my life who have supported me and let me see that I'm actually ""attractive"". 

I know attractiveness has nothing to do with it, but at least I know consciously that I'm not the monster I imagined. 

I have managed to improve my grades, I have begun to dress better and the way I like it, I have begun to get a hairstyle that I like and that suits me, and in general I am happy. 

HOWEVER, I still have the last and most complex, and that is to increase muscle mass even if it is very small. I just want to have some muscles (I don't want too much either). 

The problem is that my high school is far from my house and I always get up very early and stressed to get there. 
Therefore, I have a bad breakfast. 

Although I eat well in high school, once I return home it takes a long time and when I arrive I am usually too tired and stressed to start studying everything that accumulates on me. 

Summary: I am a person who had low self-esteem and I am improving, but I cannot follow my diet because my routine is impossible. And of course, I can only go to gym 2 days a week :(

Any advice to those who are now following a diet and going to the gym?","Hey man, the easiest way to up your calories is through calorie dense food. Try adding a tablespoon or two of natural peanut butter to smoothies or protein shakes, a bit of olive oil to salads or roasted veggies, and snack on nuts. 

Whole milk is also really great for gaining mass. Decently calorie dense with a good amount of protein and fats.

Other healthy, calorie dense foods with decent protein include avocado, chicken with the skin on and naturally oily fish.","First off, how much did you eat before 3000 calories?

You've got the human anatomy working against you. Stomach distensibility (how the stomach stretches when you eat food) is something that you can't change overnight. For underweight people, their stomach barely stretches so it feels painful to eat more than their usual portion. For overweight people, their stomach stretches a lot so eating less than usual makes them feel excessively hungry.

This is why you should go with a gradual increase in calories. Plus, the bigger your calorie surplus is, the more fat you're putting on, not muscle. Your ideal surplus should be about 300-500 kcal above your maintenance per day, irrespective of how much you weigh.","Hey there! First off, it's awesome to hear about the progress you've made in building your self-esteem and making positive changes in your life. When it comes to gaining muscle mass, consistency is key, even if your schedule is tight. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Meal Prep**: Try preparing your meals in advance. You can cook in bulk on weekends or whenever you have some free time. This way, you can have calorie-dense meals ready to go, which can help you hit your calorie goals without having to cook every day.

2. **Calorie-Dense Foods**: Incorporate more calorie-dense foods into your diet. Things like nuts, seeds, avocados, and whole grains can help you increase your calorie intake without feeling like you're eating a ton of food.

3. **Smoothies**: Consider making smoothies with protein powder, fruits, oats, and nut butter. They're quick to make, easy to consume, and can pack a lot of calories and nutrients.

4. **Snacking**: Keep healthy snacks with you throughout the day. Things like protein bars, trail mix, or yogurt can be great for getting extra calories in between meals.

5. **Efficient Workouts**: Since you can only hit the gym twice a week, focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups. This will maximize your time and help you build muscle more effectively.

Remember, progress takes time, and it's great that you're already on the right path. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing great!","First off, congrats on the progress you've made with your self-image and overall lifestyle improvements. That's seriously impressive and shows you've got what it takes to make positive changes.

For your specific situation with calories and gym time, here are some practical workarounds:

Meal prep is going to be your best friend. On weekends, prepare several days worth of high-calorie meals and snacks. Pack portable options you can easily eat during your commute or between classes - think nuts, protein bars, peanut butter sandwiches, or protein shakes.

Speaking of shakes - they're a game changer for getting calories in when you're busy. Mix protein powder, oats, peanut butter, banana, and whole milk. You can easily get 800-1000 calories in one shake. Make it the night before and drink it during your morning commute.

As for only having 2 gym days - that's totally workable for a beginner. Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc.) to maximize your limited gym time. The key is consistency with those 2 days rather than trying to force more sessions into an already packed schedule.

Remember that building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. Small, sustainable changes you can maintain will get you much further than trying to make dramatic changes that burn you out. Start with getting your breakfast and post-school nutrition sorted, then build from there.

When you're feeling overwhelmed, just focus on the next meal, the next workout. You've already proven you can make positive changes in other areas of your life - this is just another challenge to tackle one step at a time.","It's great that you've made significant progress in building your self-esteem and improving various aspects of your life. Now, tackling your nutrition and fitness goals is a fantastic next step. Given your busy schedule and limited time for the gym, it's essential to focus on making the most of your diet and workouts. 

Firstly, consider meal prepping or planning your meals in advance, especially for breakfast and post-school snacks. This can help ensure you're getting a balanced mix of nutrients even on hectic days. You might also look into calorie-dense foods that are easy to consume quickly, such as nuts, dried fruits, or energy bars, to help meet your daily caloric needs without feeling too full.

For your gym days, prioritize compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, which work multiple muscle groups at once. This will help you make the most of your limited gym time. Additionally, look into bodyweight exercises or resistance band workouts that you can do on your non-gym days to keep your muscles active.

Lastly, don't underestimate the importance of rest and recovery. With a stressful schedule, it's crucial to get enough sleep (aim for 7-9 hours) and allow your muscles time to recover between workouts. This will help your body adapt to the demands you're placing on it and support muscle growth.

Remember, consistency and patience are key. You've already shown that you can make significant changes in your life, so apply that same determination to your fitness journey. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two - just get back on track as soon as you can. Good luck!","Hey, congrats on the progress you've made so far! It sounds like you've tackled some big challenges already, and that's awesome.

Regarding the calorie intake, 3000 is a lot, especially with a busy schedule. Don't feel like you need to hit that number perfectly every single day. Consistency is key, not perfection.

Since mornings are tough, could you prep a high-calorie shake the night before? Throw in some protein powder, oats, banana, peanut butter, and milk (or a dairy-free alternative). It's quick to drink on the go and packs a lot of calories.

For when you get home, try to break down your studying into smaller chunks. Maybe eat a quick, calorie-dense snack (nuts, Greek yogurt, etc.) *before* you start studying. That way, you're fueling your brain and body. Then, set a timer for 25 minutes of focused studying, followed by a 5-minute break. During the break, you could have another small snack. This can make the whole process less overwhelming.

Also, two gym days are better than zero! Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows) to get the most bang for your buck. Make sure you're progressively overloading (lifting slightly heavier or doing more reps each week).

Finally, be patient with yourself. Building muscle takes time and consistency. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. Keep showing up, keep making small improvements, and you'll get there. Good luck!

t3_11xxjim,[Need Advice] How can I summon the same motivation I have for fitness to academic tasks?,"I'm someone who has endless energy for working out and fitness, like will do it to an almost excessive amount, always happy to do it, don't care much about pain, love pushing myself and trying to break PRs. However, getting me to sit down and do any kind of work or academic task is like pulling teeth. I hate it, I feel anxious about it, I do it for 5 minutes and my brain is screaming at me to quit and do something fun. I have the ability to succeed academically when I apply myself, it just feels like a near impossible task to ever sit down and do it whenever it's not a high stakes situation. How can I channel even a fraction of the discipline and enthusiasm I have for fitness into studying and learning?","Hey there! 

This is a fantastic question. 

Although I’m now doing college consulting and academic coaching, I no no longer teach in a classroom setting. 

Nonetheless, I’ve noticed a lot of my students have the same problem you have. They can listen to an interesting documentary about the fall of Babylon because it’s fun; or, they can read gushy romance manwhas in class for forever and a half.

However, even 2 minutes writing an analytical essay on Of Mice and Men is like pulling teeth! 

I believe this is because students are often unfamiliar with the different kinds of motivation. There’s the “fun” motivation and there’s the “flow state” motivation. (These aren’t official terms btw I just made them up) 

Fun motivation is when you’ve finished grading papers for the day and can sit at home playing Skyrim for hours until night. Your mind finds the activity engaging and therefore can do it for a long period of time. 

The “flow state” of motivation is when your mind is at peace. There’s no distractions; and, you can do seemingly boring tasks for a long stretch of time. You’re not really happy; but, you’re not in pain either. You’re just at peace. A good analogy for this is to think of long distance running. The first bit sucks. But, later on, you don’t really feel fatigued from running anymore. It’s not super good or bad; it just… is. 

The flow state may never be as engaging as fun. Academic tasks may never be as fun as fitness. Learning about derivatives is probably not as fun as playing God of War. 

But, you can condition yourself to become accustomed to the flow state. So, you mind can bear the burden of boredom and find it tolerable rather than torture. 

One method I recommend for this is to eat bland food. It sounds weird. But, next time you have to decide what to eat, choose the second best option. 

Sushi —> cooked salmon 
In n Out Burgers —> Mc Donald’s
Boba —> Lemonade

The reason you do this is to condition the mind to get accustomed to not having its way. It’ll learn that not having the #1 choice isn’t the end of the world. You can apply this principle elsewhere as well. 

Need to take a break? Don’t play video games. Instead, sleep or take a walk. This compromise can help the mind be less spoiled and be more likely to do boring tasks even if it doesn’t want to, making the flow state easier. You can also apply the principle of depriving instant gratification to the Pomodoro method and many others. 

Also, final note: remember that this is going to take time. Your mind doesn’t get trained within a day, and you’re going to have days of relapse. A good analogy is fitness and bodybuilders. They often have days when they can be disciplined such as cutting for a show. But, they relapse every so often! It’s natural, and mistakes are going to be part of the process! 

Let me know if you have any questions at all!","Your narratives (I hate it, it makes me anxious, its not fun) are probably acting as a self fulfilling prophecy.
      
Definitely need to reframe those to stimulate the reward centres of your brain. 
      
Try breaking academic tasks into small chunks (eg 20mins at a time to do one tasks) so that you can get a sense of reward from smashing them out. 
      
With practice it does become easier. It's brain training to push past the 5 minute point and every time you do it you get better at it.","Hey there! It sounds like you've got a great handle on fitness, which is awesome. The key is to try and transfer some of that mindset to your academic work. One approach is to treat your study sessions like a workout. Set specific goals for each session, just like you would with fitness. Start with small, manageable tasks and gradually increase the difficulty as you build your ""academic stamina."" You can also try to create a routine or ritual around studying, similar to how you might have a pre-workout routine. This could be as simple as having a dedicated study space or a specific time of day when you always hit the books. Lastly, try to find ways to make studying more engaging. This could be through active learning techniques, like teaching the material to someone else, or using apps and tools that gamify the learning process. Remember, it's all about consistency and finding what works for you. Good luck!","The key is to start treating your academic work like you treat your fitness - as something that makes you stronger and builds your capabilities over time. Just like you track PRs in the gym, try setting concrete study goals and tracking your progress. Start with 25-minute focused study blocks (like sets in the gym) and gradually build up your ""academic endurance.""

You already know how to push through physical discomfort for gains - now apply that same mindset to pushing through mental resistance. That anxious feeling when sitting down to study? Think of it like pre-workout jitters. The urge to quit after 5 minutes? Similar to that voice telling you to rack the weights early. You've learned to push past these in fitness, and you can develop the same mental toughness for academics.

Consider creating a reward system where you earn your workout time by completing study sessions. This leverages your existing motivation for fitness to build momentum with academics. You could also try studying in different environments, like at the gym between sets or right after a workout when you're feeling accomplished and energized.

Remember that just like fitness results compound over time, so do academic gains. Small, consistent study sessions will build up your focus and knowledge base, just like consistent training builds muscle and strength. You've already proven you have the discipline gene - now it's just about applying it to a different domain.","It sounds like you've already developed a strong sense of discipline and motivation in one area of your life, which is awesome. One strategy you could try is to identify what specifically drives your motivation for fitness - is it the feeling of accomplishment, the thrill of competition, or something else? Once you pinpoint that, see if you can apply similar principles to your academic tasks. For example, if you love pushing yourself to break PRs, maybe set specific, challenging goals for your studying, like mastering a certain concept within a week. Additionally, try to make your study sessions more engaging by incorporating elements that work for you in fitness, such as tracking progress, creating a routine, or finding a study buddy to provide accountability and support. It might also be helpful to start small, dedicating a short amount of time each day to academic tasks and gradually increasing the duration as you build momentum. Lastly, consider exploring different learning methods, like watching video lectures or working on practical projects, which might make studying feel more enjoyable and interactive, similar to how you approach fitness.","Hey, that's a really common problem! It sounds like you've already got the discipline muscle built, just gotta redirect it. Here's a thought: try framing your academic tasks like fitness challenges.

Instead of thinking ""I have to study for 3 hours,"" think ""I'm going to do 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute 'active recovery' break where I get up and move around."" Use a timer – the Pomodoro Technique is great for this. The short bursts might make it less daunting.

Also, what kind of rewards do you give yourself after a good workout? Can you apply something similar to studying? Maybe after finishing a chapter, you get to watch an episode of your favorite show, or listen to a song you love.

Finally, try to identify *why* you hate studying. Is it the subject matter? The environment? The feeling of being overwhelmed? Once you pinpoint the root cause, you can start to address it directly. Maybe you need to find a study buddy, change your study location, or break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Good luck, you got this!

1. **Identify Key Areas**: Start by listing out the main areas of your business that need attention. This could be sales, marketing, product development, etc. Once you have these, you can start to see where your time might be best spent.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Even if your company doesn't set goals, you can set personal ones. Think about what success looks like for you and your team. Is it increasing revenue, improving customer satisfaction, or something else?

3. **Time Blocking**: Try time blocking your day. Dedicate specific chunks of time to different tasks or areas. This can help you focus and ensure you're giving attention to all necessary parts of your business.

4. **Weekly Reviews**: At the end of each week, review what you accomplished and what needs more attention. This can help you adjust your priorities for the following week.

You might also want to check out platforms like LinkedIn or local business networks to find a coach or accountability partner. Good luck, and remember, it's all about finding a system that works for you!","You're on the right track recognizing that you need a systematic approach to prioritization. While a business coach could definitely help, here are some immediate steps you can take:

First, try implementing the Eisenhower Matrix for a week. Divide your tasks into four quadrants: urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not urgent/not important. This will help you identify what actually moves the needle for your business versus what just feels busy.

For revenue-producing activities specifically, track everything you do for 2-3 days, noting the approximate revenue impact of each activity. You'll likely find that 20% of your activities generate 80% of your results (Pareto Principle). These become your priorities.

As for structuring your day, time-blocking works well for autonomous roles. Set specific hours for your high-priority work when you're most productive. For example, dedicate your first 3 hours to your top revenue-generating activities before touching anything else.

For coaching, look into Vistage or similar executive coaching groups - they specialize in exactly what you're describing. They can help establish KPIs and create accountability systems tailored to your business.

In the meantime, start each day by writing down your top 3 revenue-impacting tasks. Don't move on to lower-priority items until these are complete. This simple habit can make a huge difference in your productivity and business growth.","It sounds like you're looking for help with prioritization and task management, which is a great step towards taking control of your day. Before hiring a coach, you might want to try implementing a simple framework like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize your tasks into urgent vs important and focus on the high-priority ones first. Additionally, you could start by identifying your core business's key performance indicators (KPIs) and aligning your daily tasks with those goals. This can help you determine which activities are likely to generate the most revenue. 

You might also consider using a tool like a planner or an app like Trello or Asana to schedule and track your tasks, and set aside dedicated time for planning and review each day or week. If after trying these strategies you still feel like you need personalized guidance, then hiring a coach could be a good investment. Some popular options for finding a business coach or accountability partner include websites like Clarity.fm, Coach.me, or even local business networking groups. Have you considered reaching out to your company's leadership to see if they'd be open to setting some clear goals and objectives, which could also help guide your prioritization?","Hey, that sounds like a common problem when you have a lot of freedom but not a lot of structure. It's great that you're recognizing the need for a system.

Finding a coach or accountability partner is a solid idea. Since you're looking for someone with a process, maybe search for business coaches who specialize in productivity or time management for entrepreneurs or small business owners. Look for testimonials or case studies that highlight their ability to help clients prioritize tasks and create daily structures.

In the meantime, you could try a few things yourself. Start by listing *everything* you do in a week, even the small stuff. Then, try categorizing those tasks by impact on revenue (high, medium, low). This will give you a clearer picture of where your time is actually going. From there, you can start experimenting with time blocking – dedicating specific blocks of time to high-impact activities. Good luck!

But I understand thats how life works, and recognize its importance, i have been fired, currently pissing off new friends

I am getting much better,  I have been taking a train that leaves at exactly the hr and its good training. But of course that is the time it leaves not the time it boards, so if you are not 5 mins early you are late. You just have to know this, no one says it. and i learned by missing it. I have been biking a lot because its faster than driving or transit, adaptive strategies

so what are your adaptive strategies",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're already making some great strides with the train and biking strategies. Here are a few more ideas that might help: 

1. **Time Buffer**: Try setting a personal rule to aim to be 10-15 minutes early for everything. This gives you a buffer for unexpected delays and can reduce stress.

2. **Visual Reminders**: Use sticky notes or phone reminders to keep track of important times. Seeing a reminder can help reinforce the habit of punctuality.

3. **Reverse Planning**: Start with the time you need to be somewhere and work backward to figure out when you need to leave. Factor in all the steps, like getting ready and travel time.

4. **Accountability Partner**: If possible, find a friend or colleague who values punctuality and can help keep you on track. Sometimes knowing someone else is counting on you can be a great motivator.

5. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for being on time. Positive reinforcement can help solidify the habit.

Keep up the good work, and remember, it's all about progress, not perfection!","Being chronically late is a tough habit to break, but you're already making progress with the train situation - that's a great start! Here are some practical strategies that have worked for others:

Set all your clocks 10-15 minutes fast. Yeah, you'll know they're fast, but it creates a helpful buffer and reduces stress.

Work backwards from your arrival time. If you need to be somewhere at 9am, map out each step: travel time + getting ready + buffer time for unexpected delays. Then add 15 minutes. That's your real departure time.

Reframe ""on time"" as ""early."" If something starts at 10am, mentally set 9:45am as your target. This gives you wiggle room for those unpredictable bathroom breaks or other surprises.

For recurring commitments, prep the night before. Lay out clothes, pack your bag, charge devices, etc. This eliminates morning scrambling and makes it easier to stay on schedule.

Your biking solution is smart - finding faster routes and methods is definitely part of the solution. Keep looking for those efficiency gains while building in time cushions.

Remember: being on time isn't about rigidity, it's about respect - both for others and yourself. You're already improving, so keep building on that momentum.","I totally get where you're coming from - it can be tough to adjust to the rigidity of schedules when life is inherently unpredictable. It sounds like you've made some great progress with taking the train and biking, which is awesome. One strategy that might help is to build in some buffer time to your daily routine, so if something unexpected comes up, you're not thrown off entirely. For example, you could aim to arrive 10-15 minutes before the train boards, just to give yourself some wiggle room. Additionally, you might consider using a planner or app to stay organized and on track - sometimes having a visual reminder of your schedule can help you stay focused. It's also great that you're recognizing the importance of punctuality, even if it doesn't come naturally to you. Keep working at it and celebrating your small wins, like making that train on time! What do you think about setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, like being on time for a certain number of days in a row?","Hey, I totally get the struggle with punctuality. It's frustrating when you feel like you're fighting against the clock all the time. It sounds like you're already making some solid progress with the train and biking!

For adaptive strategies, a few things have helped me:

*   **Reverse Engineering:** Instead of just aiming to be ""on time,"" figure out *exactly* what time you need to *start* getting ready. Work backwards from the departure time, factoring in everything – getting dressed, grabbing your stuff, travel time, and that crucial buffer.
*   **The ""5-Minute Rule"":** If something will take less than 5 minutes, do it *immediately*. This prevents those little tasks from piling up and making you late.
*   **Visual Reminders:** Set alarms, but also use visual cues. Leave your keys by the door, put a sticky note on your mirror with your departure time, anything to keep it top of mind.
*   **Embrace the ""Boring Buffer"":** Accept that you might sometimes arrive early and have to wait. Bring a book, listen to a podcast, or just people-watch. It's way less stressful than rushing.
*   **Forgive Yourself (and Learn):** You're going to slip up sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just analyze what went wrong and adjust your strategy for next time.

It's a process, not a switch you flip. Keep experimenting and finding what works for you! Good luck!

t3_v3f7wv,[need advice] how to effectively lessen time on social media ¿,I use my phone when I get tired of doing tasks but I realized that I waste most of my time just scrolling down my phone and I tend not to notice how much time it consumes. I want to get disciplined but I just keep on doing the same thing every day. wish anyone could help me out.,"Try putting your phone away when doing tasks. I keep my phone outside of my room (where my desk is) inside my bag by the front door. It's many walks away from me when I'm working which makes it inconvenient to use. 

Another inconvenient tactic - I moved all my social media apps on my phone to the third page of my home screen inside the 5th page of a folder. It takes me 5 swipes to get to my distracting apps. Definitely helps!",Use the mobile browser version of social media apps. The experience is so garbage you won’t want to use it for long,"Hey there! Cutting down on social media can be tough, but it's definitely doable with some small changes. Start by setting specific time limits on your apps using your phone's settings or a dedicated app. This way, you'll get a reminder when you've hit your limit. Also, try to replace the habit with something else you enjoy, like reading a book or going for a walk. It might help to schedule these activities into your day so you have something to look forward to. Lastly, consider keeping your phone out of reach when you're working on tasks to reduce the temptation to pick it up. Remember, it's all about small, consistent changes. You've got this!","Here's what helped me break the endless scrolling cycle: start by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete social media apps and only access them through your browser. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less appealing.

Next, create ""speed bumps"" that make you pause before mindlessly grabbing your phone. Move social media apps into a folder on your second or third home screen. Set up app timers (both iPhone and Android have these built in). Put a rubber band or sticky note on your phone as a physical reminder to ask ""do I really need to check this right now?""

The key is replacing the habit with something else when you need breaks. Keep a book nearby, do some quick stretches, or even just close your eyes for 2 minutes. These alternatives can still give you that mental breather without sucking you into the scroll vortex.

Start small - try setting a 15-minute daily limit on your most-used social media app. Once that feels manageable, gradually reduce limits on other apps. You'll likely slip up sometimes, but that's normal. Just reset and try again the next day.

Remember: your phone should be a tool that serves you, not the other way around. You've already taken the first step by recognizing the issue. Now it's just about making small changes that add up over time.","One strategy that might help is setting specific times when you allow yourself to check social media, and sticking to those times. For example, you could give yourself 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening to scroll through your feeds, but try to avoid mindless scrolling throughout the day. You could also try removing social media apps from your phone's home screen or using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl to limit your access to certain sites during certain hours of the day. Another approach is to replace social media with a different habit when you feel tired or need a break, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises. It might take some experimentation to find what works best for you, but starting small and being consistent can make a big difference over time.","Hey, I totally get that. Social media is designed to be addictive! Here's a few things that might help:

First, try setting a timer whenever you pick up your phone during a break. Even if it's just for 10-15 minutes. When the timer goes off, force yourself to put the phone down and get back to work. Awareness is the first step.

Second, think about *why* you're reaching for your phone. Are you bored? Stressed? Once you know the trigger, you can find a healthier alternative. Maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or listening to a song.

Third, make it harder to access social media. Delete the apps from your phone and only access them on your computer (which is less convenient). Or, use app blockers to limit your time on specific apps.

Finally, be patient with yourself. It's a process, and you're not going to break the habit overnight. Just keep trying, and celebrate small wins along the way. Good luck!

t3_qgkn3j,[Need Advice] I don’t respect my own schedule,"I’m in a hotel right now quarantining because I’m going on a business trip. I have all this time to my self but anytime I schedule something for me to do let’s “9:30am review forms” I don’t do it. I have a self dialogue with myself like “fuck you, do it later, watch some economics videos, you’ve got all this time”. It’s the third day and I’m still putting it off and every time I start I get distracted and do something stupid like snacking, calling friends on discord or watching YouTube",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut with sticking to your schedule, which is totally normal, especially when you're in an unusual environment like a hotel. One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of scheduling a full task like ""","Hey there - I totally get the self-sabotage cycle you're describing. The good news is that being in a hotel actually gives us a perfect environment to build some better habits. Here's what's worked really well for others in similar situations:

Start ridiculously small. Instead of blocking out ""review forms"" for an hour, commit to just 5 minutes. Set a timer. Anyone can do anything for 5 minutes, right? Often you'll find yourself naturally wanting to continue once you've started.

Create a ""workstation"" in your hotel room that's separate from where you relax/watch videos. Even if it's just sitting at the desk instead of the bed, your brain will start to associate that space with focus.

The ""temptation bundling"" technique could help too - only allow yourself to snack or watch those economics videos WHILE reviewing forms. Make the ""distraction"" activities contingent on doing the important stuff.

Most importantly, drop the self-judgment when you get off track. Just reset and try again with an even smaller commitment. ""Okay, just one form"" is a perfectly valid goal. Success builds on success, no matter how small the win.

You've already shown awareness by recognizing this pattern - that's actually a huge first step. Now it's just about creating the right environment and starting so small it feels almost too easy. You've got this.","It sounds like you're struggling with self-regulation and procrastination. One strategy that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and then commit to working on them in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break (this is called the Pomodoro Technique). This can make your tasks feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Additionally, try to eliminate or limit distractions during your work sessions - close unnecessary tabs on your laptop, log out of Discord, and put your snacks away. It might also be helpful to set a ""starting ritual"" for yourself, like making a cup of coffee or doing a quick stretch, to signal to your brain that it's time to focus. Remember, developing self-discipline is a process, and it's okay to start small and build up gradually. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't stick to your schedule perfectly at first - just acknowledge the setback and try to do better next time.","Hey, I totally get that feeling of rebelling against your own schedule, especially when you're stuck in a hotel. It's like your brain knows you *should* be doing something, so it actively tries to avoid it.

A couple of things that might help: First, try breaking down that ""review forms"" task into smaller, less intimidating chunks. Instead of ""review forms"" at 9:30, maybe it's ""review first 5 forms"" at 9:30. Smaller steps feel less overwhelming.

Second, ditch the all-or-nothing mentality. If you get distracted, don't beat yourself up and throw the whole day away. Just gently redirect yourself back to the task. Think of it like a muscle – the more you practice redirecting, the easier it gets.

Third, maybe those ""economics videos"" aren't the enemy. Could you schedule them *after* you've done a chunk of form reviewing? Use them as a reward. ""Review 5 forms, then watch 15 minutes of economics.""

Finally, and this is key: forgive yourself. Quarantine is weird. Business trips are stressful. You're not going to be perfect. Just try to be a little bit better each day. Good luck!

t3_qnn5nw,[Need advice] I’m not even functional under pressure. Only when threatened,"I’m failing miserably at work. Like, I can go days stressed but without doing a single thing and obviously it’s becoming a problem at work. Only when my boss threatens to fire I get motivated, but that motivation only lasts a couple of days.

Needless to say, I don’t even like my job. I am a lifestyle journalist so I have a lot of cool perks like gifts from luxury brands, trips, dinners at expensive restaurants. I have a totally glamorous life I couldn’t afford on my income. But other than that, I’m miserable. 

What can I do to be able to work like a normal person?","I have ADHD, so I have to basically give myself small windows of time to do specific tasks with “rewards.” Otherwise I experience similar stalling out.","life feels like a boring chore when I don't have gratitude for things. when gratitude is lost, my mind is only capable of coming up with excuses of why I shouldn't do the thing. I realised recently that I only accomplish goals and projects that I feel truly inspired to do. even if I need to come up with a narrative to tell myself of why THIS project is so important, for example if it's for somebody else I may feel more compelled to do a thing for them if I feel they deserve it. but what's really empowered me is finding all the reasons I want to complete these tasks that are for me, with my own vision in mind, visualizing it and bringing it to life is much easier than doing a measly task that somebody else told you to do a certain way. have fun and just know it takes practice so start with getting the gratification from completing small tasks and remember that your brain is hard wired currently to get gratification in more immediate ways so it won't be happy about this new delayed gratification thing for a while but stick with it, it takes6 weeks to rewire old habits","It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First, it's important to recognize that motivation driven by fear (like the threat of being fired) isn't sustainable. Instead, try to find small, intrinsic motivators in your work. Even if you don't love your job, there might be aspects you can find interesting or rewarding. 

Start by setting small, manageable goals each day. Break your tasks into smaller chunks and tackle them one at a time. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and make it easier to get started. Also, try to establish a routine. Having a set schedule can help you build momentum and make it easier to get into a productive mindset.

Consider using techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and prevent burnout. Lastly, reflect on what you truly want in your career. If this job isn't fulfilling, it might be worth exploring other opportunities that align more with your interests and values. Remember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself as you work through this.","It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of only responding to immediate threats rather than developing sustainable work habits. This is actually pretty common - our brains are wired to react strongly to immediate dangers while finding it harder to stay motivated for longer-term consequences.

The first step is to be honest with yourself about whether you want to stay in this job. The perks are nice, but if you're genuinely miserable, no amount of discipline techniques will fix that fundamental mismatch. Consider whether you'd rather redirect your energy toward finding a role that energizes you naturally.

If you decide to stay, here's what can help break the threat-response cycle:

Start incredibly small. Pick one tiny work task that takes 10 minutes or less. Do it first thing every morning, no exceptions. This builds momentum and gives you a small win to start the day. Once that becomes automatic (usually takes about 2 weeks), add another small task.

Create artificial deadlines for yourself. Break larger projects into smaller chunks with self-imposed deadlines. Share these deadlines with a colleague or your boss to add accountability. This mimics the urgency that currently only comes from threats, but in a controlled way.

Set up a reward system that isn't dependent on external perks. Maybe 25 minutes of focused work earns you a 5-minute break to do something you enjoy. This helps retrain your brain to associate work with positive outcomes rather than just avoiding negative ones.

Remember: sustainable discipline comes from systems, not willpower. Focus on building these small habits rather than trying to force yourself to suddenly become super productive through sheer determination.","It sounds like you're struggling with a classic case of procrastination and motivation issues. One thing that might help is to identify the underlying reasons why you're not motivated to work, beyond just the threat of being fired. Since you mentioned you don't like your job, it's possible that you're feeling unfulfilled or disconnected from your work. 

Try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set specific goals for yourself. This can help make your work feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, consider finding ways to make your work more meaningful or engaging, even if it's just in small ways. For example, you could try to focus on the aspects of lifestyle journalism that interest you the most, or explore ways to use your platform to tell stories that matter to you.

It might also be helpful to establish a routine or schedule for yourself, and stick to it as much as possible. This can help you build discipline and momentum, even when you're not feeling motivated. And when you do feel motivated, try to capitalize on that energy by getting as much done as you can, rather than letting it fade away after a couple of days.

Lastly, consider exploring what you would need to change in your job or career to make it more fulfilling for you. It's possible that there are other opportunities out there that would be a better fit for your passions and interests. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.","Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of procrastination and panic, fueled by a job you don't even enjoy. That's a tough spot to be in.

First, let's tackle the immediate problem: getting work done. Since threats are the only thing that seem to motivate you, maybe you can create artificial ""threats"" for yourself. Try setting really strict deadlines for yourself, and if you miss them, impose a consequence you actually care about. Like, donate to a cause you *don't* support, or skip one of those fancy dinners. It sounds silly, but it might trick your brain into action.

More long-term, it sounds like the real issue is the job itself. The perks are nice, but they're clearly not enough to make you happy or motivated. Maybe it's time to seriously consider what you *do* want to do. Could you leverage your journalism skills into a different field? Or maybe explore a completely different career path?

Start small. Spend 30 minutes a day researching other options, networking, or even just brainstorming what a fulfilling career would look like for you. Even small steps can build momentum and give you a sense of control. It's easier to be disciplined when you're working towards something you actually care about. Good luck!
",Overcoming
t3_109wkgv,"[Need Advice] I am slowly losing all respect for myself. I genuinely feel that no one respects me, because I have nothing to be respected. Only my parents trust me, and it hurts me they do, because I'm not worthy of that trust. I'm good at nothing.","I don't know where to begin. I don't think I'm good at anything. I'm not useful to anyone. I stay at home, enrolled in a distance learning university course, but I don't study at all. I have not been studying for the last 5-6 years, since I was in school. I even did my last year of school twice, and right now I'm failing my last two semesters, and I haven't told anyone about it at my home. I'm hiding it, and thinking that I'll pass those subs next semester, but I don't think I can. I just don't study. I know the solution is to just study, but no matter how much I think or plan about it I can't do it. I always start, and can't continue. I have no self control. I even made this goal to study 10 min previous year a day, and I can't follow it.

But the problem is not just about studying. I don't do anything else. I go to play some sport, and I always find myself to be worse than everyone else. My friends also play with me, and they are improving while I'm not and trust me I try to get better. I have lost the respect I once had of being a good player. Now no one even thinks about me, and no one wants to take me in their team. I feel like an outcast. I also go to the gym (and this is the only good decision I made almost 6 months ago), and for the last two months my partner has been lifting more than me, and I just don't push. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel unable to push my limits in the gym even when I try. I'm doing worse than I used to. And my partner also doesn't talk with me like he used to. He was my best friend, and now he just doesn't make any conversation with me. I try to talk with him, and he would answer my questions, but will not start the conversation from his side unless it's really necessary, and friends aren't supposed to be like this I think. I feel like I have lost a best friend because I used to be very careless when I talked to him before. I said anything, and most of the time I used to talk negative about things. Maybe this got him and now things aren't same between us. Also when I go to play sports, even there people aren't any bit attentive towards me. I don't feel like going to play sports anymore. I don't wanna improve my sports anymore. I feel sad about it and it hurts when I realise what I'm thinking, but it's true. Genuinely, inside of me, I just don't want to play sports anymore or push myself at gym. I feel unable to.

Most importantly, everyone around me doesn't treat me with any respect. I can tell, because nobody pays attention to me. No one listens carefully when I speak. Maybe I have got myself in a bad company, but then I think why would anyone respect me? What do I have to contribute? Nothing. I am only wasting my parents money day by day, and returning nothing to the outside world. I only use my screens all day, waste time watching pornography or browsing reddit or some other shit, and just want comfort. Now I know if I start doing some things and tried to establish some good habits then things will change, but I have been thinking like this and trying to change myself for the last 6 years, and I think I have gotten worse. I think something is highly wrong with me, because I just can't do things I want to do. Why am I like this? I have no respect for left for me, and I don't know why I am writing this. Maybe I just want to tell someone how I feel. I feel completely destroyed from inside. Day by day my respect decreases for myself. I try to not compare myself with anyone but myself, but then I think I'm extremely slow and if others can improve then I should too. 6 years is a lot of time. I am only escaping my reality, and when I face it then I go back to escaping it even harder.

Due to this mentality, I am not eating well, and taking care of myself. I don't even want to take shit on time, it's this bad. What do I do? I feel extreme sadness. I feel like I'm depressed.","Hi there. Are you a woman? Have you had your blood tested for vitamin D, B, iron levels, TSH? I found that my inability to concentrate was in fact due to very low iron levels. Basically, I was running on less oxygen than everyone else for years. It didn't matter how much I wanted to do stuff, I just couldn't. It also made me feel depressed. Also, are you on birth control pills? A lot of women in recent years found out that made them depressed as well.

I think before you conclude it's just your motivation, rule out any physiological causes, because you won't be able to will yourself out of a biological problem or deficiency. You may even have had it for so long you think your energy levels are normal when they're not (and people will look down on you for being lazy and unmotivated when it's really not in your control at all).

Also that's why it's even more important that you start to eat regularly and healthy again, even if you don't feel like it, because motivation really is tightly coupled to your energy intake. Eat well.","I am a man. I will try to rule out any physical causes. From now on I am making my physical health my top priority. I will try to eat well, and I will eat on time. I will also try to take care of my health in any way I can. Drink water properly, maintain good posture(this is very imp, because I can't even sit while I'm eating), sleep well, etc. Thanks for this new insight. I don't know why I didn't think about it for so long. I really want to get better.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to acknowledge how hard it is to feel stuck like this. First off, it's important to remember that everyone struggles at some point, and you're not alone in feeling this way. It might help to start with small, manageable changes. Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small thing you can do each day. It could be as simple as setting a timer for 5 minutes to study or going for a short walk. The key is consistency, not perfection.

When it comes to studying, try to create a routine that makes it easier to start. Maybe set up a specific time and place where you study every day, and remove distractions as much as possible. For the gym, focus on your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others. Everyone's journey is different, and improvement can be slow and steady.

As for your friendships, it might be worth having an honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Sometimes, just opening up can help rebuild connections. And remember, respect often starts with how you treat yourself. Try to be kind to yourself and recognize the small wins along the way.

Lastly, if you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to talk to a professional who can provide support and guidance. You're taking a big step by reaching out here, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and take it one day at a time. You've got this.","First off - you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people go through periods where they feel stuck and disconnected from their potential. The good news is that you've already taken some positive steps - you've been consistently going to the gym for 6 months, which shows you're capable of building good habits.

Let's start small. Really small. Forget about comparing yourself to others or trying to fix everything at once. Pick ONE tiny thing you can do today. Maybe it's studying for just 5 minutes (not 10), or making your bed, or drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. The goal isn't to transform overnight - it's to prove to yourself that you can follow through on something, no matter how minor it seems.

For your studies, try the Pomodoro technique but modified - start with just one 5-minute session per day. Set a specific time (like right after breakfast) and stick to it. After a week, try two 5-minute sessions. Build gradually.

Regarding your gym partner and sports - sometimes when we're struggling internally, we project that onto our relationships and performance. Focus on showing up consistently and doing what you can. Progress isn't linear - everyone plateaus sometimes.

Consider talking to your university's counseling services. What you're describing sounds a lot like depression, and getting professional support could help you break this cycle. They can also help you make a plan for your academic situation.

Remember - respect isn't about being the best at everything. It's about being someone who keeps trying, who owns their mistakes, and who takes small steps forward even when it's difficult. Start treating yourself with the same patience you'd show a good friend who was struggling.

Take one small action today. Just one. Then do it again tomorrow. That's how change begins.","It takes a lot of courage to share something as personal as this, so thank you for being honest about how you're feeling. It sounds like you're struggling with a deep sense of inadequacy and self-doubt, which is making it hard for you to motivate yourself to make positive changes in your life. First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean there's anything fundamentally wrong with you. Many people struggle with similar feelings, and it's possible to work through them.

One thing that stands out is that you've been trying to change yourself for six years, but you haven't seen the progress you want. This can be really frustrating, but instead of beating yourself up over it, maybe it's time to try a different approach. Rather than focusing on all the things you're not doing well, what if you started small and focused on one or two areas where you'd like to see improvement? For example, you mentioned that going to the gym was a good decision - what if you built on that by setting a specific, achievable goal for yourself, like increasing your workout frequency or intensity by a small amount each week?

It's also important to recognize that respect from others often starts with self-respect. When you take care of yourself and do things that make you feel good about who you are, you're more likely to earn the respect of others. This doesn't mean you need to be perfect or have all the answers - it just means you need to be willing to show up for yourself and try your best.

In terms of your daily habits, it might be helpful to start tracking what you're doing each day, including how you're spending your time and what you're eating. Sometimes, just becoming more aware of our patterns can help us identify areas where we'd like to make changes. You could also try setting a few simple, achievable goals for yourself each day, like taking a short walk or doing a few push-ups.

Lastly, it might be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling - not just about the specifics of your situation, but about the emotions that are underlying everything. A therapist or counselor could provide you with a safe and supportive space to explore these feelings and work through them. Remember, you don't have to do this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to be this honest about it. It's understandable that you feel lost and overwhelmed right now.

First off, be kind to yourself. You're recognizing these issues, which is the first and hardest step. Don't beat yourself up for past failures; focus on what you can do *today*.

It sounds like you're trying to tackle everything at once, which can be paralyzing. Instead of aiming for massive changes, try focusing on one tiny, manageable thing. You mentioned struggling with studying even for 10 minutes. Okay, how about 5? Seriously. Set a timer for 5 minutes, open your book, and just *look* at the page. No pressure to understand it, just be present with it for those 5 minutes. The goal isn't to master the material, it's to build the habit of showing up.

The same goes for the gym. Forget about what your partner is lifting. Focus on *your* personal best from *last week*. Can you beat that by even one rep? That's a win. Small, consistent progress is key.

Regarding your friend, maybe try a sincere apology. Acknowledge that you realize you've been negative and that you value the friendship. It might not fix things instantly, but it's a start.

As for feeling like no one respects you, respect is often earned through competence and contribution. But you can't contribute if you're stuck in this cycle. Start small, build momentum, and the respect will follow.

Finally, consider talking to a professional. You mentioned feeling depressed, and a therapist can provide tools and support to help you break free from these patterns. There's no shame in asking for help. You're not alone in this.

t3_s4kp0u,"[Need advice] I am lacking a purpose, hence procrastination","I feel I am lacking a purpose, I am comfortably living with my parents while pursuing my graduation, my expenses have always been pretty low and hence there is no do Or die situation, I don't need money at the moment, hence I lack the motivation to work. 
I don't have any immediate purpose to work, I do want to make a life for myself but I procrastinate a lot, I fail at taking action.maybe I am dreamer type of procrastinator I dream a lot and live in those dreams fail to take action in real life

I am clueless, I don't know what to do, can you all suggest something?",,,"Finding purpose can be tough, especially when there's no immediate pressure to act. One approach is to start small and build momentum. Try setting a simple daily goal that aligns with something you're curious about or enjoy. It could be reading a chapter of a book, learning a new skill online, or even just taking a walk to clear your mind. The key is consistency. As you build these small habits, you'll start to see progress, which can be motivating. Also, consider exploring different activities or volunteering; sometimes purpose comes from unexpected places. Remember, it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Focus on taking small steps and be patient with yourself.","Hey there - I totally get the dream vs action struggle. The good news is that you don't need an immediate crisis to start building a meaningful life. In fact, your current stability can be an advantage since you can focus on growth without pressure.

Here's what helped me break out of similar patterns: Start by picking ONE small project that interests you. Could be learning to code, starting a blog, or even mastering a new skill. The key is choosing something concrete rather than abstract life goals.

Set aside just 30 minutes each day - that's it. Use a timer. During that time, work on your chosen project with zero distractions. No phone, no daydreaming. The time limit makes it less daunting and more doable.

The magic happens when you string together a few days of actual progress. Those small wins create momentum and show you that you CAN move from dreams to reality. Your brain starts craving that sense of accomplishment.

Remember that motivation usually follows action, not the other way around. You don't need to feel motivated to start - you just need to start. Purpose often reveals itself through doing rather than thinking.

Want to share what kind of projects or skills interest you? That could help narrow down where to begin.","It sounds like you're struggling with a common issue - having too much comfort and not enough urgency to motivate you. One thing that might help is to set some personal goals for yourself, even if they're not necessarily related to making money right now. What are some things you've always wanted to achieve or learn? Try to identify a few areas where you'd like to see progress, whether it's in your studies, a hobby, or personal development. 

Then, break down those big goals into smaller, actionable steps. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of ""making a life for yourself,"" focus on taking one small step each day towards your goals. It could be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to studying, or an hour to working on a personal project. The key is to build momentum and get into the habit of taking consistent action.

Also, consider setting a ""stop doing"" list - identify things that are holding you back, like excessive screen time or procrastination habits, and make a conscious effort to stop doing them. It might be helpful to create a schedule for yourself, even if you don't have any external commitments, just to give your day some structure and purpose.

Lastly, don't worry too much about being a ""dreamer type"" of procrastinator - it's great that you have big aspirations! The important thing is to start taking small steps towards making those dreams a reality. You can always adjust your course as you go along, but the key is to get started and build some momentum. Good luck!","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough to get motivated when things are comfortable and there's no immediate pressure. It sounds like you're stuck in a bit of a dream-procrastination loop.

Here's a thought: maybe you don't need a grand ""purpose"" right now. Instead, try focusing on smaller, achievable goals that align with the kind of life you *want* to build. Think about skills you'd like to have, experiences you want to try, or even just things that genuinely interest you.

Pick *one* small thing and commit to working on it for just 15-20 minutes a day. It could be learning a new language, coding, writing, drawing – anything. The key is consistency, not perfection. Those small wins can build momentum and give you a sense of accomplishment, which can then lead to bigger things.

Also, try breaking down your bigger dreams into smaller, actionable steps. Instead of just dreaming about ""making a life for yourself,"" think about what that actually *means* to you. What does that life look like? What skills or experiences would you need to get there? Then, break those down into even smaller, manageable tasks.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and see what sticks. You might find that your ""purpose"" evolves as you try new things. Good luck, you got this!

t3_10su3r0,how do i start my journey to be disciplined? [need advice],,"Imagine you are a meter under water, with a large stone keeping you down.

Imagine the feeling of urgency, the focus and the strength.

You instantly get all you need to avoid drowning.

If you have a good enough reason you will get all the discipline you need.

Find that reason.",Damn that's true,"Starting your journey to become more disciplined can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down into small, manageable steps can really help. First, identify one area you want to improve—maybe it's waking up earlier, exercising regularly, or studying more consistently. Start with a small, specific goal related to that area, like waking up 15 minutes earlier or doing a 10-minute workout each day. Consistency is key, so focus on building the habit rather than the intensity or duration at first. Track your progress to stay motivated, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up—just get back on track the next day. Over time, as these small habits become part of your routine, you can gradually increase the challenge. Remember, discipline is like a muscle; the more you work on it, the stronger it gets. Good luck!","Starting your journey to discipline is a great first step. The key is to start small and build momentum gradually - trying to transform your entire life overnight usually backfires.

Pick one small habit you want to develop and focus on that for 2-3 weeks. It could be making your bed each morning, reading for 10 minutes, or doing a 5-minute workout. The specific habit matters less than consistently showing up each day.

Use habit stacking by attaching your new habit to something you already do automatically. For example, ""After I brush my teeth, I will make my bed"" or ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 10 minutes.""

Track your progress with a simple method like marking days on a calendar or using a habit tracking app. Seeing your streak builds motivation to keep going.

When you miss a day (and you will), just get back on track the next day. The goal isn't perfection - it's progress. Once your first small habit feels automatic, you can gradually add another while maintaining the first.

Remember that discipline is like a muscle - it gets stronger with consistent practice. Start small, stay consistent, and be patient with yourself as you build these new patterns.

What specific habit would you like to start with? That could help guide your first steps.","Starting your discipline journey can feel overwhelming, but taking that first step is a huge accomplishment in itself. I'd recommend beginning by identifying one area of your life where you'd like to see improvement, whether it's waking up earlier, exercising regularly, or being more productive with your time. Set a specific, achievable goal for yourself in that area, and then break it down into smaller, manageable habits. For example, if you want to start exercising regularly, your first habit might be as simple as putting on your workout clothes every morning, even if you don't actually work out at first. Focus on building one habit at a time, and be patient with yourself - discipline is a skill that takes time to develop, but with consistent effort, you can get there. What's one area of your life where you think you'd like to start building more discipline?","Okay, so you want to start being more disciplined? That's awesome! The best way to start is small. Don't try to overhaul your entire life at once. Pick *one* thing you want to improve. Maybe it's making your bed every morning, or studying for 30 minutes a day.

Once you've picked that one thing, make it as easy as possible to succeed. Lay out your clothes the night before if you want to exercise in the morning. Put your study materials on your desk. Reduce the friction.

Then, track your progress. A simple checkmark on a calendar can be surprisingly motivating. Don't beat yourself up if you miss a day, just get back on track the next day. Consistency is key, not perfection. Good luck, you got this!

t3_10tjbal,I really want to delete TikTok but unsure on how to. [Need Advice],I am definitely experiencing a problem a lot of other people are and it’s that I use tiktok to avoid the feeling stress and anxiety.  I’m wanting to delete tiktok in order to become more productive in my studies however when I have deleted it I’m struggling to face the realities with having to deal with stress and end up re-downloading it.   any suggestions ?,"If you think TikTok is that bad for you, then just delete your account, set a blocker in your phone or something. But really, try to find help to deal with your stress or you won't ever be ""productive""","What you need to understand is the root cause of your anxiety.
TT is a dopamine inducing app.. no wonder it’s hard for some people to delete that crap.
understand that , it’s acting as a gateway for your brain to not deal with the anxiety.. so you are masking the symptoms not addressing the root cause.

TT is trash, FB is trash depending how u use it.IG is trash.

Focus on becoming a better person, work on yourself and you’ll get better for sure","Deleting TikTok can definitely be a challenge, especially when it's become a go-to for stress relief. One approach is to gradually reduce your usage instead of going cold turkey. Set specific times during the day when you allow yourself to use it, and slowly decrease that time over a week or two. Meanwhile, try to find alternative ways to manage stress, like going for a walk, meditating, or even just taking a few deep breaths. You could also replace TikTok with apps that support your goals, like ones for studying or mindfulness. Remember, it's about creating a balance that works for you, so be patient with yourself as you make these changes. Good luck!","The key is to replace TikTok with better ways to manage stress and anxiety, rather than just trying to white-knuckle through deletion. When you're stressed about studying, your brain wants that quick dopamine hit that TikTok provides. But there are healthier alternatives that can both relax you AND keep you productive.

Try this approach: Instead of completely eliminating your breaks, schedule specific 10-15 minute ""decompress"" periods between study sessions. During these breaks, do something active but relaxing - stretch, take a short walk, do some breathing exercises, or even just step outside for fresh air. These activities help reduce stress while keeping you present, unlike TikTok which just numbs you temporarily.

You might also want to try the ""delete and replace"" method. Delete TikTok, but immediately download a meditation app or podcast app instead. When you feel the urge to reach for TikTok, you'll have a healthier alternative right there on your phone. The Pomodoro technique (25 min study + 5 min break) can also help structure your study time so you don't feel overwhelmed.

Remember that it's normal to feel uncomfortable at first - your brain needs time to adjust to new habits. Start with small changes, like ""no TikTok during study hours"" before going for full deletion. Each time you resist the urge to download it again, you're building stronger discipline muscles.","It's great that you're recognizing how TikTok is affecting your productivity and wanting to make a change. Deleting the app is a good start, but as you've found, it's not a magic solution for dealing with stress and anxiety. One approach might be to replace TikTok with other coping mechanisms that are healthier and more productive. For example, you could try journaling, going for a short walk, or practicing deep breathing exercises when you feel stressed. This way, you're still giving yourself a break and a chance to relax, but in a way that doesn't involve mindless scrolling. Additionally, you might consider setting specific study goals and rewards for yourself, so you have something to look forward to and can stay motivated. It's also important to address the underlying stress and anxiety - are there any specific study skills or time management techniques that you're struggling with? Focusing on building those skills could help you feel more in control and confident, making it easier to stay off TikTok for good.","Hey, I get it. TikTok can be a real time sink, especially when you're stressed. It's tough to just quit cold turkey. Instead of deleting it outright, maybe try a few things first.

One thing that helped me was setting a timer for TikTok use. Start with, say, 30 minutes a day and gradually reduce it. When the timer goes off, force yourself to close the app, no matter what.

Also, think about *why* you're reaching for TikTok. You mentioned stress and anxiety. Can you find healthier ways to cope with those feelings? Exercise, meditation, even just talking to someone can make a difference. If you have other hobbies, try to engage in those when you feel the urge to scroll.

Another trick is to make it harder to access TikTok. Move the app icon to a less convenient spot on your phone, or even log out after each use. A little friction can go a long way.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to slip up. The important thing is to keep trying and find what works for you. Good luck!

t3_v37kpt,[Need Advice] How to resist the urge to eat?,"I read the post about masturbation and it kind of put me in front of my problem: eating. Too much.
How to resist cravings? Like leftovers, etc… 
Send help. Right now I can only stay between 2.000 and 2.500 kcal while I should be at 1.500/1.7000.
I usually eat out of boredom. 

Any tips?","You have to know why you're eating. Are you bored? Is it emotional eating? Scarcity mindset? Body image problem? Eating disorder? Depression/anxiety?

You can't fix the problem until you know what it is. Eating is just the symptom."," A someone who struggled with dissorderd eating, imposing more restrictions when you are already (physically OR mentally) restricting WONT help your cause. For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.

When you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.

What helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very ""unhealthy"" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.

During that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot ""fail"" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. 

Btw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.

I know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.

F the bikini body, your happiness is more important. Treat the issue (could be anything, you gotta figure it out on your own), not the symptom (overeating).","Hey there! It sounds like you're trying to get a handle on your eating habits, which is a great step. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Since you mentioned eating out of boredom, try to pinpoint when these moments happen. Is it during a specific time of day or after certain activities? Once you know your triggers, you can plan alternative activities to distract yourself, like going for a walk, reading, or picking up a hobby.

2. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to your food, savoring each bite, and eating slowly. It can help you feel more satisfied with less food.

3. **Healthy Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks on hand for when cravings hit. Things like fruits, veggies, or nuts can be satisfying without adding too many calories.

4. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.

5. **Meal Planning**: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive eating. Knowing what and when you'll eat can help you stick to your calorie goals.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Small changes can lead to big results over time. You've got this!","Eating out of boredom is super common, but there are several practical ways to get a handle on it. First, try to make eating more intentional - sit down at a table without distractions and focus on your food rather than mindlessly snacking. This helps you feel more satisfied with proper meals.

For managing cravings and leftovers specifically, portion control starts in the kitchen. Store leftovers in individual containers with proper portion sizes right after cooking. Put them toward the back of the fridge and keep cut vegetables or other low-cal snacks front and center for when you want to munch.

The boredom aspect is key here - you'll want to build a ""menu"" of alternative activities to do instead of eating. Keep your hands busy with a hobby like drawing or crafts, go for a walk, call a friend, or tackle a small task you've been putting off. The urge to eat often passes after 10-15 minutes of doing something else.

Drinking water or herbal tea can also help curb false hunger. Try keeping a large water bottle with you and setting specific meal/snack times. This creates structure and makes it easier to stick to your calorie goals.

Remember that building new habits takes time. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself as you develop a healthier relationship with food. You've already taken a great first step by recognizing the pattern and seeking solutions.","Resisting the urge to eat, especially when it's driven by boredom, can be tough. One strategy that might help is to find alternative activities to do when you feel the urge to snack. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing a few jumping jacks, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Sometimes, our brains can mistake boredom for hunger, so giving yourself something else to focus on can help curb unnecessary eating. 

Another approach is to plan out your meals and snacks in advance, including healthy options that fit within your calorie goals. This can help reduce the temptation of leftovers or other high-calorie foods. You might also consider removing or limiting triggers - like keeping leftovers out of sight or finding healthier ways to cope with boredom, such as reading, drawing, or calling a friend.

It's also worth exploring why you're eating out of boredom. Is there something missing that food is filling? Addressing the underlying issue can make it easier to develop healthier habits. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it's about progress, not perfection. Small steps, like reducing your daily calorie intake gradually or finding one new activity to replace eating out of boredom, can add up over time.","Hey, I get it, food cravings can be tough! It sounds like you've already identified boredom as a trigger, which is a great first step.

A few things that might help:

*   **Hydration is key:** Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger. Try drinking a big glass of water when a craving hits.
*   **Find a replacement activity:** Since you mentioned boredom, have a list of go-to activities ready. This could be anything from reading a book, going for a walk, calling a friend, or working on a hobby. The goal is to distract yourself until the craving passes.
*   **Out of sight, out of mind:** Leftovers are your weakness? Maybe portion them out immediately after a meal into single-serving containers and freeze them, or give some away. Make it harder to mindlessly grab them.
*   **Plan your meals:** Knowing what you're going to eat and when can help you stick to your calorie goals. Pre-tracking your food in an app can also make you more aware of what you're consuming.
*   **Don't beat yourself up:** If you slip up, don't throw in the towel. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track with your next meal. Small changes add up over time!

You've got this! It's a process, so be patient with yourself.

t3_x68x18,[Need advice] How do I get back on track after a vacation?,"Might sound silly, but I had a 2-week vacation from work and I decided to actually relax and recharge my batteries.


Now I have some troubles getting back to my routine. I can hardly wake up on time and I am so so tired. I used to do lots of things but now even the bare minimum is hard. 

Any tips?","First, it is important to realize that vacation is good for you and it is ok to recharge and relax. That is the purpose of the vacation. 

Maybe biggest mistake was that you ruined your sleep schedule but that will correct itself soon. Don't snooze etc. You will be tired few days but eventually body adapts and pick up new schedule again. Remember to eat enough healthy food to fuel your body. 

Mindset : Decide that vacation is over, it was temporary and now you have work period again and that daily routine is what you need to follow now.","Hmm, now that you're asking these questions I might get a better picture.

 I stayed at home during the vacation to recharge my batteries. I still went to sleep at my usual time (10PM) but woke up relatively late (8 or 9AM, compared to 6 or 7AM) so idk if this threw off my sleep schedule?

No drinking, I might've enjoyed a glass of cider every noe and then but not to that extent.

During vacation I simply read, exercised, rested and watched some movies. It was, indeed, like a prolonged weekend. So that might be post vacation blues?","Getting back into the swing of things after a vacation can definitely be a challenge, but it's totally doable with a few small steps. First, try to re-establish your sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help reset your internal clock. Start with small, manageable tasks to ease back into your routine. Maybe focus on just one or two key activities you used to do, and gradually add more as you feel comfortable. Also, consider setting a short morning routine that energizes you, like a quick workout or a few minutes of meditation. Lastly, be patient with yourself—it's normal to need a little time to adjust. You've got this!","This is totally normal after a vacation! Your body and mind got used to a different rhythm, and now they need time to readjust. Instead of trying to jump right back to 100%, try easing back into your routine over the next few days.

Start with getting your sleep schedule back on track first - this will help with the tiredness and make everything else easier. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you're back to your usual bedtime. Even if you can't sleep right away, just lying down at a consistent time helps reset your body clock.

For your other activities, pick just 2-3 essential ones to focus on this week. Once those feel manageable, gradually add back the rest. Think of it like warming up before a workout - you wouldn't go straight to lifting your max weight after taking time off.

Remember that it usually takes about a week to readjust after vacation. Be patient with yourself while maintaining gentle consistency. By this time next week, you'll likely be back in your groove.","Getting back into a routine after a break can be tough, especially when you've been relaxing and recharging. One thing that might help is to start small - instead of trying to jump right back into your old routine, try easing into it by setting tiny, achievable goals for yourself each day. For example, if you used to wake up at 6am, try starting by waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually work your way back up to your old wake-up time. Also, make a list of the bare minimum tasks you need to get done each day and focus on completing those first, then you can start adding more tasks as you build momentum. It's also important to be kind to yourself and remember that it's okay to not be 100% productive right away - it takes time to get back into a routine, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything done at once.","Hey, it's totally normal to feel that way after a vacation! You basically hit the reset button on your routine, so it's like starting fresh.

Don't try to jump back into everything at once. That's a recipe for burnout. Instead, pick *one* thing you want to get back to this week – maybe it's waking up on time, maybe it's a quick workout. Focus on nailing that one thing, and then add another next week.

For the tiredness, make sure you're getting enough sleep *now*. Even if you were sleeping in on vacation, a consistent sleep schedule is key. Also, hydration and some light exercise (even a walk) can do wonders for energy levels.

Be kind to yourself. You earned that vacation! It's a process, not a light switch. You'll get there.

t3_130arkx,[Need Advice] How do you resist the urge to procrastinate after finally starting on a task?,"When I finally push myself on doing a certain task, I only end up doing it for a minimal period. I'm unable to keep streaks and I lack the consistency. It's the same when I try to form a new habit. I end up failing to be consistent on it until I pick it up again and the cycle goes on.

When I try advices I read relating to this, I manage to follow it on the first few days then end up not following it in the proceeding days. I also tend to get distracted a lot on every small changes in my life and some spontaneous events/schedules which makes me easily disregard what I'm currently doing or focusing on.

So, how do you resist the urge to procrastinate after finally pushing yourself on starting a task?","I always tell myself that done is better than perfect.

Break the task down into manageable small goals, which you can then proceed to complete one at a time without feeling rushed.","For me it’s a fear of imperfection (I removed “fear of failure”, I wonder if imperfection in my mind is actually failure…yikes). Once something is done it can evaluated on it merits. When incomplete it can’t yet be evaluated. If you don’t finish it, it can’t be wrong. God, I gotta get some help.","It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common struggle, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This way, you can build momentum with small wins and feel a sense of accomplishment that keeps you going. Also, try setting a specific time each day dedicated to working on your task or habit. Consistency in timing can help build a routine, making it easier to stick with it even when life throws distractions your way. 

Another tip is to minimize distractions by creating a dedicated workspace or using tools like website blockers during your work sessions. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. It's all part of the process. Just refocus and start again. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. Keep at it, and you'll find your rhythm!","Starting is often the hardest part, but it sounds like maintaining momentum is your bigger challenge. Here's what's worked for me and many others:

First, make your tasks smaller and more specific. Instead of ""study for 3 hours,"" try ""complete one practice problem"" or ""read one section."" This makes it less overwhelming and gives you clear stopping points.

The key is to build consistency through small wins rather than trying to transform everything at once. Pick just ONE habit to focus on for now. When you try to change too many things simultaneously, it's easy to get overwhelmed and fall back into old patterns.

For maintaining focus during tasks, try the Pomodoro technique - work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Set a timer and commit to just one session. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue after the timer goes off, but if not, that's okay too. You still made progress.

Keep a simple habit tracker (just checkmarks on a calendar work great) and focus on not breaking the chain. But here's the important part - if you do miss a day, don't let it derail you completely. Just pick back up the next day. Consistency doesn't mean perfection.

For dealing with distractions, create a dedicated workspace if possible. Put your phone in another room, use website blockers if needed. The goal is to make it slightly harder to get distracted and slightly easier to stay focused.

Remember that building discipline is like building muscle - it takes time, you'll have setbacks, but each attempt makes you stronger. Start small, be consistent with the basics, and gradually increase from there.","One strategy that might help is to focus on making progress rather than trying to maintain a perfect streak. Instead of aiming to work on a task for a certain amount of time, try setting a smaller goal, like completing a specific part of the task or working on it for just 10-15 minutes without any distractions. This can make it feel less overwhelming and allow you to build momentum. Additionally, consider implementing a ""stop doing"" list, where you identify common distractions that derail your progress, such as social media or email notifications, and make a conscious effort to avoid them while you work. It might also be helpful to create a schedule that includes some flexibility, so when unexpected events or changes come up, you can adjust your plan without feeling like you've completely fallen off track. Remember, consistency is not about being perfect, it's about showing up and making progress, even if it's just a little bit each day.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's super common to start strong and then fizzle out. Here's a thought: instead of focusing on resisting the urge to procrastinate *after* you've started, maybe try making the initial task even smaller and more appealing.

Think micro-goals. If you want to write, don't aim for an hour. Aim for 5 minutes. Seriously. Set a timer. When it goes off, you can stop guilt-free. Often, you'll find you want to keep going. If not, you still accomplished something. This helps build momentum and makes the task less daunting.

Also, about those distractions... try to identify your biggest triggers. Is it your phone? Social media? Specific people? Once you know what they are, you can put barriers in place. Turn off notifications, use website blockers, or let people know you need uninterrupted time.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Consistency isn't about perfection; it's about showing up more often than not. If you miss a day, don't beat yourself up. Just get back on track the next day. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck!

t3_t1rhmp,[Need Advice] How to deal with 'What makes you think you can do X' comments? AM I too stand-offish?,"Today I spoke to my mom about my dreams of going overseas to work and experience the culture.

My mom just went 'what makes you think its so easy'

Like, I know it's not easy, but can she just let me dream? I've never had such a big want before. The last time was in high school, and it's the same shit I got from my mom 'what makes you think you can be come a club president?' I never became the president, but I became the vice, and the president gave me full authority to handle training, events and competition while she spoke to the teachers, coaches etc.

Seriously. 'You can do sponsorship?' 'are you really that good a pianist?' 

I get it tho, that she's tired. I've not completed my degree yet at 27, and it's honestly difficult cuz I hate what I'm studying and I regret making the 'practical' choice. Also I've been working and have an online business while doing all this.

I just answered: what's wrong with dreaming big?, Look, if I want to do it, then I'll give it a go. At least I've tried even if I don't make it.' while I really wanted to say 'If you don't want to help, shut it.'

I realise now that this whole time, I've been waiting for her validation. I shouldn't be waiting, and I should head out and leave people with her kind of attitude behind. Got called an idiot for not knowing to cook when they wouldn't even alow me into the kitchen. 'We give you freedom' but that never actually happened. I had enough. I'm not waiting for their validation, praise, approval anymore. 

My school experience was the same: I trained my sopranos while my coach worked on the altos, she called me rude. I was the Head of stage managent for a uni event. There were boxes of sponsored items backstage, and no one informed us. I called the sponsorship team but no one picked up, so I moved the sponsored items out cuz we needed the space. As a result, some of the items got stolen. I got called stupid, and I gave them hell. 

It makes me standoff-ish, but I'm slowly realising I don't have a choice. (advice needed, DO I have a choice?). Standoff-is should have been my default mode. I need to learn to act without their validation.

As my friend said: people who aks you 'what makes u think u can do X' don't know what it takes to be great.

Advice on how to move forward?
- My habits are in sort of in place, working on it but it's slowly getting better.
- still dunno what I want to do, but I'm exploring slowly. Literally, I've asked God, bazi and tarot cards too. 
- how do u all deal with comments like my mom's?","You're 27. You should be putting this time and effort into your goals not asking strangers how to feel about what a person they don't know anything about feels about your goals.

Maybe your mom is mean... Maybe she's seen you lose interest or bite off more than you could chew one too many times.. We don't know. All the character analysis you got on her above are just assumptions and projections.

Your question was what to do about the comments and my answer is 'nothing'. 
You're an adult. 
You should set goals on your own, go after them on your own, earn them on your own. If people cheer you on or doubt you shouldn't matter.","> What makes you think you can do X?

It's that I don't think I can't.  That's the difference between us.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of external doubt, but it's great that you're recognizing the need to move forward without waiting for validation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your overseas dream. Break it down into smaller, actionable steps. This will help you focus on what you can control and make the dream feel more attainable.

2. **Build a Support Network**: Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your dreams. This could be friends, mentors, or online communities. Having a positive support system can make a huge difference.

3. **Practice Self-Validation**: Start acknowledging your own achievements and progress. Celebrate small wins and remind yourself of your capabilities. This can help reduce the need for external validation.

4. **Respond with Confidence**: When faced with skepticism, respond calmly and confidently. You can say something like, ""I understand it's challenging, but I'm committed to giving it my best shot.""

5. **Learn from Criticism**: While some comments can be discouraging, try to extract any constructive feedback that might help you improve. If there's nothing useful, let it go.

Remember, it's your journey, and you're allowed to dream big. Keep exploring and refining your path, and don't let doubt hold you back. You've got this!","Your friend is absolutely right - people who question ""what makes you think you can do X"" often speak from their own limitations and fears. The fact that you've already succeeded as a vice president, managed events, and run an online business while studying shows you're capable of achieving what you set your mind to.

Here's what's worked for many people dealing with unsupportive comments: First, recognize that seeking validation is natural, but make it a conscious practice to act independently of others' approval. When someone questions your abilities, respond with ""I'll figure it out"" or ""We'll see"" and keep moving forward. These responses acknowledge the challenge while maintaining your autonomy.

For your overseas work dreams specifically - start taking concrete steps. Research visa requirements, connect with people who've done it, maybe start learning the language. Each small step builds momentum and proves to yourself (not others) that you're serious about this path.

The standoffishness you're feeling isn't necessarily bad - it's your independence asserting itself. But instead of becoming defensive, channel that energy into quiet determination. Let your actions speak louder than any response you could give to doubters.

Remember: Every person who's achieved something meaningful faced doubters along the way. The key difference is they kept going anyway. You've already shown you can succeed despite skepticism - your track record proves it. Keep building those habits, keep exploring your interests, and keep moving forward. The best response to ""what makes you think you can do X"" is simply doing X.","It sounds like you're at a crossroads where you're trying to break free from seeking validation from others, especially your mom, and forge your own path. That takes a lot of courage, so kudos to you for recognizing the pattern and wanting to make a change.

When dealing with comments like ""what makes you think you can do X,"" it's essential to remember that they often stem from the other person's fears, doubts, or limitations. Your friend's quote is spot on - people who ask those questions might not understand what it takes to achieve greatness. Instead of taking their comments personally, try to see them as a reflection of their own mindset.

Your response to your mom, ""what's wrong with dreaming big?"" is a great start. It shows that you're not willing to let her doubts bring you down. To take it further, you could practice asserting yourself calmly and confidently, without feeling the need to justify or explain your goals. A simple ""I'm excited about this opportunity, and I'm going to give it a shot"" can go a long way in setting boundaries.

It's also important to surround yourself with people who support and encourage you. Having a network of positive influences can help counterbalance the negative comments and make it easier for you to stay focused on your goals.

As for being ""standoff-ish,"" it's not necessarily a bad thing to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries. In fact, it's a sign of self-awareness and self-respect. You don't have to choose between being standoff-ish and seeking validation; instead, focus on developing a sense of self-trust and self-compassion. That way, you'll be more resilient to negative comments and better equipped to make decisions that align with your values and goals.

Keep working on your habits, exploring your interests, and seeking guidance from various sources (including God, bazi, and tarot cards - whatever works for you!). Remember that it's okay to take your time figuring things out, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks. You're on the right path, and with persistence and self-awareness, you'll get closer to achieving your dreams.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but also like you're on the cusp of some real breakthroughs. It's tough when the people closest to you aren't supportive, especially when you're trying to figure things out.

First, about your mom's comments: It's classic negativity bias. Some people just default to pointing out potential problems. You're right, you don't need her validation. Her comments are more about her own fears and limitations than about you. The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge her point (internally, you don't have to say it out loud), and then just keep doing your thing. Think of it as background noise. You can't control what she says, but you *can* control how you react.

As for being ""standoff-ish,"" it sounds like you're setting boundaries, which is healthy. You don't *have* to be standoffish, but you *do* have a right to protect your energy and dreams. Maybe try reframing it as being selective about who you share your goals with. Not everyone deserves to hear them.

Moving forward, keep exploring! You're already doing the right things by trying different avenues to figure out what you want. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have all the answers right now. It's a journey, not a destination.

Regarding habits, small consistent steps are key. Celebrate the small wins, and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. It's all part of the process.

And finally, remember your friend's words: ""people who ask you 'what makes u think u can do X' don't know what it takes to be great."" Believe in yourself, even when others don't. You've got this.

t3_13xpkhy,"[need advice]I want to get a job, but my anxiety & mental health is preventing me from doing anything",".

Im just sick of myslef going back n forth about facing my fears. Im watching endless content about motivation on YouTube but nothing sparks my stupid brain. I don't know what's preventing me from doing anything. I tell myself everyday, I'll apply or call this place. Maybe learn a skill or sign up for courses but I end up just saying stuff and not doing any research. I just get so much anxiety and go into overthinking mode. Sometimes I feel stuck because I have no game plan to do the tasks accurately. Like creating a well structured resume, which websites and job titles to look for when applying. I just don't know. 
instead I'm doing other things in the house that isn't relevant to my life. Im doing chores and wasting time on phone. Yet in the back of my mind, I'm 24 hours worried about my life and it's driving me nuts. Today is already June 1st and can't believe how fast time flies. Im realizing all this that I'm wasting time and I'm not doing anything to work on my fears. Im just allowing fears, anxiety, overthinking eat me up. Instead of having that rage of anger. Im mellow down🤦","
Analysis Paralysis seems to be what you have. Possibly depression.

Setting aside a third space away from home like the library or coffee shop and blocking out time to plan steps… small steps in achieving what you need to do will help. It allows you to make small victories. “Therapy in a nutshell” is a good YouTube resource and “healthygamergg” on anxiety.

If you have things that saps up your dopamine and wearing your energy out line social media, tv, video games, drugs, alcohol, or pornography it’s time to ween off those.

Finding a job will be a lengthy process so you’d need to set expectations for that. Getting a professional resume reviewer and person to cater you to the right job with realistic expectations can help as well. You can find one for less than $150. It’s worth it. As they write your resume with your notes or update your old one.

Exercise especially running at the gym on a treadmill can be a keystone habit towards weightlifting. They are basically both attacking your paralysis through body chemistry and giving you mindfulness. Along with nutrition, sleep routine. 

If you’re on low income find a therapist to talk things out and map your actions.

Deep focus is something that needs to a lot of work as well. Where you are in a mode of just getting things done without excessive over thinking. Look up atomic habits and deep focus books also short summaries can be found on YouTube.

Meditation and yoga Excercise can also help you emotionally regulate as well.


I have your problem right now as well. In a different situation switching jobs and needing to study. But with deep analysis paralysis and no drive.

Small things that helped me are above especially exercise. Doctors all diagnosed with clinical depression and it’s something that takes time to address.

I wish you peace and strength on your journey","I am in the exact same position as you. Crippling mental health issues that are getting the better of me and preventing me from moving forward in my life all while being worried about time running away from me, which it is and fast. I can't give you any proper meaningful advice because if it was good advice I wouldn't be in this situation. 

One day at a time. Grab a pen and paper one night and just make a small list of things you would like to achieve. Don't make them big things, make them little things. Me for example, the other night, I wrote this list and put on it

- write a resume/CV 
- go for a walk every morning for 15 mins
- do laundry and tidy your room

You get the idea, once you achieve these little things, the big tasks won't seem so daunting. Something else I've been doing to fight my anxiety is go into the city or town whatever it is you have where you live and force yourself to talk to people. Anyone at all. 

As for motivational videos on YouTube, they won't really help too much. They are just videos made by people trying to capitalise on your rut for the most part. The only person that can help you fully achieve your goals is yourself. And you can do that, it just takes willpower. I've done it before and fell down and i WILL get back up again. 

I do recommend looking into stoicism. It can help greatly with the way you think and the way you approach problems. 

I wish you all the best","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. First off, remember that it's okay to feel anxious and overwhelmed—many people do when facing big changes. To start tackling this, try breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. For example, set a goal to work on your resume for just 15 minutes a day. Once you get started, it often becomes easier to keep going. 

Also, consider setting specific times for job searching or skill learning, and stick to them like appointments. This can help create a routine and reduce the feeling of being stuck. You might also want to limit your time on YouTube and your phone, as they can be distractions. Instead, use that time to take small actions towards your goals. 

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family for support or even to review your resume. Sometimes, a little encouragement from others can make a big difference. You've got this!","Hey there - what you're experiencing is really common, especially with job searching. Let's break this down into smaller, manageable steps instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Start with just 15 minutes today. That's all. Pick ONE small task, like creating a basic resume draft. Don't worry about making it perfect - just get the main points down: your education, any work experience, and skills you have. There are plenty of free resume templates on Google Docs that can give you a structure to follow.

For the job search itself, start with just one website - Indeed is pretty straightforward. Search for entry-level positions in fields that interest you. Save 3-5 job posts that catch your eye, even if you don't feel qualified yet. This will help you understand what skills employers are looking for.

The key is to stop watching motivation videos and start taking tiny actions. Motivation follows action, not the other way around. Each small step builds momentum. Maybe tomorrow you spend 15 minutes customizing your resume for one of those saved jobs. The next day, you actually submit it.

Remember that everyone feels anxious about job hunting - it's not just you. The difference is taking action despite the anxiety, not waiting for the anxiety to go away first.

Want to start right now? Close YouTube, set a timer for 15 minutes, and work on that resume draft. Then come back and let us know how it went.","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed by your anxiety and fears. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the patterns that are holding you back - that's a huge step. Now, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, why not start with tiny, manageable tasks? For example, commit to spending just 10-15 minutes a day on job searching or skill-building activities. This could be as simple as updating your resume, researching job titles, or browsing online courses. The goal is to build momentum and confidence, not to feel overwhelmed. Additionally, consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller, actionable steps. For instance, if creating a well-structured resume feels daunting, start by just making a list of your skills, experience, and education. Then, gradually add more details and refine it over time. Remember, progress over perfection is key. It might also be helpful to set specific, achievable goals for yourself, like applying to a certain number of jobs per week or dedicating a few hours on the weekend to learning a new skill. Having a clear plan can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more in control. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about ""wasting time"" - it's okay to take breaks and do things that bring you comfort. Just try to find a balance between relaxation and productivity. You got this, and taking small steps today can lead to big changes over time.","Hey, I get it. That feeling of being stuck in a loop is super frustrating. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to do everything perfectly right away, and that's probably feeding the anxiety.

Instead of trying to overhaul your whole life, how about breaking things down into *tiny* steps? Seriously tiny. Like, today, instead of ""researching courses,"" just find *one* course that looks remotely interesting and bookmark the page. That's it. Tomorrow, maybe spend 5 minutes reading the course description.

For the job search, same thing. Don't worry about the perfect resume. Just pick *one* resume template online and copy/paste your existing info into it. Doesn't have to be perfect, just a starting point. Then, pick *one* job site (Indeed, LinkedIn, whatever) and search for *one* job title.

The key is to make the initial steps so small that they're almost impossible to fail at. This helps build momentum and reduces the anxiety of facing a huge, overwhelming task. Celebrate those small wins!

Also, be kind to yourself. It's okay to have off days. Just try to get back on track with those tiny steps the next day. You got this!

t3_127c77r,[Need Advice] The cure for hypersomnia.,"I have the opposite problem of most modern adults. I don't struggle with sleep. Quite the opposite - I struggle with hypersomnia. Basically given the option I will seek out sleep and desire it pretty much all the time. It's unique from simply being ""tired"". I've had days where for one reason or another I didn't get good sleep and I can differentiate between ""I did not get quality sleep"" and ""I have gotten plenty of sleep but still feel sleepy"". 

Thus far all medical explanations have fallen flat. Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. Frankly I think it's mostly behavioral that stems from past depression (when I slept a lot simply for lack of desire to do anything else). That depression has waned but the sleep issue persists. It interferes with work (I can near automatically shut off alarms even when I add obstacles, I can fall into a nap after laying down only a minute or two, and so I tend to overslept and miss even things I want to do). 

Things I've tried: I try covering my bed with stuffed animals during the day as a deterent but they're easy to toss aside. I try keeping myself generally bust during the day though this isn't always practical (and doesn't help in the morning when the battle is hardest). Anything I would use to stay awake when I reach the point where my brain says ""sleep"" I will just remove them to get the sleep. Even if I know I will feel worse afterward (for those who don't know if you get too much REM you can become essentially ""sleep drunk"" and it's not enjoyable or helpful).",">Because I don't just fall asleep in any position it's not narcolepsy. 

That doesn't mean it's not narcolepsy. Have you seen an actual sleep specialist?","It sounds like you need a sleep study, both a PSG and MSLT. I have narcolepsy and it basically means your brain doesn’t regulate your sleep-wake cycle appropriately. Narcolepsy can also just mean that you feel sleepy almost all the time (this is more or less how it is for me) or may even have sleep attacks (the unmistakable feeling that you just have to take a nap right now) or it can be some of both. The image of a person just suddenly collapsing into sleep is due to severe cataplexy which is a defining feature of narcolepsy type 1, and what the brain is doing is slipping into REM as a result of an emotional response. That person is also simultaneously conscious and awake. When you go into REM your muscles kind of weaken and paralyze so you don’t act out your dreams, and that’s what’s happening with cataplexy. It can also be very mild where one might feel their legs weaken or knees buckle when laughing or when someone get frustrated and they drop whatever is in their hand because they lose muscle grip. Narcolepsy type 2 generally looks like being excruciatingly sleepy all day. I have type 1, my sister has type 2. We’re both really damn sleepy but also sleepy in slightly different ways. Narcolepsy can come with it’s own insomnia feature of feeling most awake at night. But that’s just part of the sleep-wake cycle dysregulation. People with narcolepsy are also likely to have too much REM sleep and skip the deep sleep stage. And you don’t need all the symptoms, you could literally just be sleepy all the time and be diagnosed with it. Then there is also narcolepsy’s cousin idiopathic hypersomnia which is basically “We don’t know why, but you’re just pathologically sleepy”. It can look a lot like narcolepsy and narcolepsy can look a lot like it. Depression is common for both. Both disorders can be diagnosed and medicated.

I chose to not take meds because I get a lot of side effects from stimulants, so I manage with lifestyle choices. The biggest one for me is diet. Too many carbs and sugar and I’ll be a sleepy zombie. Too much pizza for dinner will result in being completely unproductive the following day. Caffeine too late into the afternoon, after 3pm will diminish my quality of sleep that night. I’ll sleep but my quality of sleep is terrible. Exercising and staying active is extremely difficult and too much can put me under, but just doing light exercise will help in the long run once I’m in the habit and get over the initial sleepiness hurdles. Anything drowsy inducing is off limits, avoid meds with drowsiness as a side effect which sucks when you have allergies, although antibiotics are unavoidable, and limit alcohol or just don’t drink at all. Knowing how much to sleep has helped tremendously. I function best at between 6-7 hours, less and I feel like hell, and more than 8 and I have sleep drunkenness all day and feel a different kind of hell. You can try to experiment with any of those.

But seriously, get yourself to a doctor and request a sleep study if you need a referral. Ask for both a PSG and a MSLT. Have a two week sleep log ready to go, and you can even show up with a self-administered Epworth Sleepiness Scale results. If your score is in the 8-10 range that’s common for sleep apnea, if you’re in the 17+ range you’re in the narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia range. Feel free to drop on by the narcolepsy sub in which we support folks with IH also. I’ve heard your story dozens of times, it’s common in our community. Don’t cheat yourself out of a potentially better life.","It sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation, but it's great that you're looking for ways to tackle it. Since you've mentioned that medical explanations haven't helped much, focusing on behavioral changes might be a good approach. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Morning Routine**: Try establishing a consistent morning routine that you enjoy and look forward to. This could be something simple like a favorite breakfast, a short walk, or listening to music. The key is to create a positive association with waking up.

2. **Light Exposure**: Increase your exposure to natural light, especially in the morning. This can help regulate your circadian rhythm and signal to your body that it's time to be awake.

3. **Physical Activity**: Incorporate some form of physical activity into your day. Even a short walk or some stretching can boost your energy levels and reduce the urge to nap.

4. **Mindful Breaks**: Instead of napping, try taking short, mindful breaks where you do something relaxing but not sleep-inducing, like deep breathing or a quick meditation.

5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can be a great motivator.

Remember, it's about small, consistent changes rather than drastic overhauls. Be patient with yourself as you experiment with what works best for you. Good luck!","Since you've ruled out medical causes, let's focus on breaking this behavioral pattern through environmental and habit changes. First, make your bed completely inaccessible during the day - not just covered with stuffed animals, but stripped of blankets and pillows. Store these in a closet or another room. This creates a much stronger barrier than items you can easily move aside.

For mornings, place your alarm across the room and pair it with immediate exposure to bright light - either natural sunlight or a smart bulb that turns on with your alarm. The key is making the transition from sleep to wake more decisive. As soon as you're up, do something physically engaging like 5 jumping jacks or walking to the kitchen for a glass of water.

Throughout the day, try the ""5-minute rule"" when you feel the urge to nap. Tell yourself you'll do just 5 minutes of any activity (stretching, walking, organizing) before deciding about sleep. Often the urge passes once you're engaged in something else. Keep a log of times when you feel most sleepy and what you were doing just before - this can help identify triggers.

The most important thing is to maintain a consistent wake time, even on weekends. Your body will gradually adjust to expect wakefulness at certain times. When you do feel the need to rest, set a strict 20-minute timer for naps and only take them before 3pm.

Remember that breaking this pattern will feel uncomfortable at first, but each day you resist unnecessary sleep helps rewire your brain's expectations. Start with these changes and adjust based on what works best for you.","It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough challenge, and it's great that you've already explored medical explanations and are considering the potential behavioral roots of your hypersomnia. Given your history with depression, it's possible that sleep has become a coping mechanism or a deeply ingrained habit for you. 

One strategy you might consider is setting up a consistent wake-up routine that doesn't involve immediately getting back into bed. This could be as simple as making yourself a cup of coffee or tea, taking a short walk outside, or doing some light stretching. The goal is to create a clear distinction between sleep time and wake time, and to give yourself a sense of purpose and momentum in the morning.

You've also mentioned that you tend to oversleep and miss out on things you want to do, which suggests that there may be some underlying motivation or reward structure at play. Could you try setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day, and rewarding yourself when you meet them? This might help you build a sense of accomplishment and motivation that can compete with the desire to sleep.

It's also worth considering seeking out the help of a therapist or counselor who can work with you to address any underlying emotional or psychological issues that may be contributing to your hypersomnia. They can help you develop strategies for managing your sleep and building healthier habits, and provide support and accountability as you work to make changes.","Okay, that sounds really tough. It's frustrating when medical explanations don't quite fit, and you're left trying to manage something that feels behavioral but is still really impactful.

Since you suspect it's rooted in past depression and a learned behavior, maybe try tackling it like breaking any other habit, but with extra self-compassion. It sounds like you're already fighting hard against it.

Here are a few ideas, focusing on small, incremental changes:

*   **Sleep Hygiene, Revisited:** I know you've probably heard this a million times, but really drill down on the basics. Consistent sleep/wake times (even on weekends!), a truly dark/quiet/cool room, and a solid wind-down routine. The consistency is key, even if you don't feel sleepy.
*   **Light Therapy:** Since you mentioned REM sleep issues, maybe look into a sunrise alarm clock or light therapy lamp, especially in the mornings. It can help regulate your circadian rhythm and potentially reduce that ""sleep drunk"" feeling.
*   **Tiny Wins, Big Rewards:** Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on one small victory each day. Maybe it's just getting out of bed within 5 minutes of your alarm. Reward yourself for that *immediately* with something you genuinely enjoy (a specific coffee, a quick walk, etc.). The immediate reward is important to rewire the association.
*   **Habit Stacking:** Link getting out of bed to something you *want* to do. ""After I turn off my alarm, I will immediately [make coffee/stretch/read one page of a book]."" Make it something appealing and easy.
*   **Professional Help (Again?):** It might be worth revisiting therapy, specifically focusing on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), even though you don't have insomnia in the traditional sense. The techniques for managing sleep-related thoughts and behaviors might still be helpful.
*   **Accountability:** Find someone to check in with you daily. Just a simple text message exchange: ""Did you get up on time?"" ""Yes/No."" Knowing someone is expecting you to be up might add that extra bit of motivation.

The biggest thing is to be patient with yourself. It's a process, and there will be setbacks. Don't let a bad day derail your progress. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Good luck!

I'm not really sure how to get out of this cycle without going too hungry but I really want to do better for myself this time around. I'm sure I can lose weight again but since I always gain it back, I've been cowering feom actually doing anything. Please send any tips and advice.","I’d set one small, attainable goal for yourself for this weekend. You sound like you could use some momentum. It could be to get outside both weekend days, eat 2 vegetables tomorrow, or whatever. You can’t change your situation but you can choose some actions that will start you in the right direction.","I don’t know your situation though I would say your first step will be to learn to be kind to yourself, your body carries you this word and does a lot for you, be kind to it. As recommended earlier in this thread set small goals. If you have a goal for where you want to be, even a small step forward is okay. Try to set your goals tied to doing the process rather than what you “should” look like. When you do the latter you’re constantly living in a state of not succeeding at your goal which will add stress to an already stressful life. Learning to love the process and using the scale as a metric to refine your process rather than define yourself is a helpful headspace. Examples of where to start could look like “for the next three months I will walk for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week” or “for the next three month I will stick to a meal plan and not snack 3/7 days a week”.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. Balancing med school and personal goals is tough, but it's definitely doable with some small, consistent steps. 

Start by identifying specific triggers for your overeating. Is it stress, boredom, or social pressure? Once you know what sets it off, you can work on strategies to manage those moments. For stress, try incorporating short, daily activities that help you unwind, like a quick walk, meditation, or even just deep breathing exercises. 

When it comes to food, try to plan your meals and snacks ahead of time. Having a set plan can help you avoid impulsive eating. Also, keep healthier snacks on hand so when you do feel the urge to munch, you have better options available. 

Remember, it's not about being perfect but making small, sustainable changes. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Building discipline is a journey, and you're already on the right path by taking the first step. You've got this!","Hey there - I totally get the challenge of managing weight while dealing with a stressful med school environment. Instead of trying to make dramatic changes all at once, let's focus on small, sustainable adjustments you can make even within your current situation.

First, for stress eating: Try keeping a food journal for a week, noting not just what you eat but what triggered the eating (stress, boredom, social pressure, etc.). This will help you spot patterns and plan alternatives. When you identify a trigger, have a ready replacement activity - maybe a quick walk, some stretching, or even studying in a different spot.

For portion control: Use smaller plates and bowls, and try the ""pause method"" - eat half your portion, wait 10 minutes while drinking water, then reassess if you're still hungry. When others offer leftovers, practice saying ""Thanks, but I'm good!"" It might feel awkward at first, but people usually respect a clear boundary.

For sustainable weight management: Focus on adding healthy foods rather than restricting. Add an extra serving of vegetables to each meal, or start your day with protein-rich foods. These small additions can naturally crowd out less healthy choices without feeling like deprivation.

Remember, you've successfully lost weight before, so you know you're capable. The key this time is building habits that work with your busy schedule, not against it. Start with one small change this week - which of these suggestions feels most doable to you right now?","It's great that you're acknowledging the role stress plays in your overeating, and that's a huge step forward. As a med student, you likely have a lot on your plate, but trying to tackle your weight loss goals without addressing the underlying stress might not be sustainable. Have you considered finding alternative ways to cope with stress, like exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend? These can help reduce your reliance on food for comfort. 

In terms of eating habits, it might be helpful to start tracking what you eat and when, to identify patterns and triggers. You don't have to drastically cut back on food, but being more mindful of your portions and hunger cues could make a big difference. It's also okay to say no to others' leftovers or to eat because you can - prioritizing your own needs is important. 

Since you've lost weight before, you know it's possible for you. Instead of focusing on the end goal, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps, like taking a short walk each day or preparing healthier meals in advance. This can help build confidence and make the process feel less overwhelming. Remember that it's not about being perfect, but about making progress and developing habits that you can maintain in the long term.","Hey there, I totally get the med school struggle – it's a pressure cooker! It's awesome that you're recognizing the connection between stress and eating, that's half the battle.

Instead of focusing on a huge weight loss goal right away, maybe try some smaller, more manageable changes. Since you mentioned boredom and leftovers are triggers, could you try keeping healthy snacks readily available (like cut veggies or fruit) and pre-portioning them? That way, when boredom hits, you're reaching for something that aligns with your goals.

For the leftover situation, it's okay to politely decline! You could say something like, ""Thanks, but I'm trying to be mindful of my portions right now."" People usually understand.

Also, think about adding in some stress-reducing activities, even if it's just for 15 minutes a day. A quick walk, some stretching, or even just listening to music can make a difference. It's about finding healthy coping mechanisms instead of turning to food.

Don't beat yourself up if you slip up – it happens! Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Small, consistent changes are way more sustainable than trying to overhaul everything at once. You got this!

t3_10ecn4n,[Need Advice] My issues are spiraling out of control,"I need to change, but I’m not sure how, or rather where to start.

There are a bunch of issues, some more recent than others. It just seems like they’re culminating in a way now, making the overall situation worse.

&#x200B;

I procrastinate to the point of being self-destructive. For a long time, throughout school and beyond, putting things off over and over worked out perfectly fine, because with a little bit of last-minute crunch I was able to achieve most things, and the consequences for when I couldn’t were mild. In hindsight, this never forced me to develop the necessary skills and discipline for working continuously on projects, or myself in general. What little I have in that regard has been a struggle to acquire. However, it’s not even universal. I absolutely hate going to the gym, but I still do it regularly anyway. So, objectively, I can get off my ass repeatedly. I have some methods to restrain myself. But more often than not, I push of the important things over and over. Sometimes critically important things. So much so that it seems like I don’t care about myself at all. Going out of my way for other people is no problem, for me though…

&#x200B;

I have developed some agarophobia during the pandemic, and probably anxiety about confronting people, f.e. clerks for bureaucratic concerns, doctors appointments and so on. I’ve always been introverted, but not averse to people in general. Ever since the lockdowns, going out somewhere is suddenly a matter of discipline. Some instance in my brain just doesn’t want me to go anywhere, and I have to force myself through that every time, even though it’s not even particularly bad. Of course, this exacerbates the procrastination.

&#x200B;

I lie, reflexively, all the time, and then commit to those lies unnecessarily. About my plans for the day, about how I’m feeling, how a particular thing is progressing, a bunch of different things, really. Upon reflection, those lies seem to aid all the things above, as well as being more comforting than the truth for people around me. As if, in the moment, lying is quicker than explaining myself thoroughly, while the truth just makes the other party concerned, but still unable to help anyway. On top of this idiocy, I then commit to those lies to appear consistent, like having said I’m going to X at a certain time, and then “having to” go somewhere, like to public library, and working on something that isn’t even urgent.

&#x200B;

I waste time, instead, with things that aren’t even important to me. When I put off a phone call and rather start cooking something elaborate and then thoroughly enjoy it with other people, it’s still not ideal, but I’m mostly fine with it. Most of the time though, a part of my brain just seem to go like “avoid X at all cost” and fills the space “until” X with anything and everything. Youtube, games, chats with people, cleaning, researching, reading, doomscrolling, walking… Anything trivial. The large majority of which I won’t even remember the day after. Concerning is, how oftentimes I don’t even register that I’m purposefully avoiding something in the moment. It’s like being on autopilot, or a drunken binge. REALLY concerning is, that even when I do realize what I’m doing (or rather not doing) I can’t reliably lift myself out of it, and start. If I do, it is incredibly taxing. If I don’t, it feels almost dissociative, like I’m bewildered how I don’t care enough about this/myself.

&#x200B;

I also might have dampened my emotional responses somehow. When observing other people, having similar issues, they’re kickstarted into action by strong emotions, even without discipline. Their pride, self-loathing, feeling of obligation, spite, or concern about themselves or others are a strong impetus. Like a safety line, before things get too out of hand. I do have these feelings, but I sometimes wonder why they are so soft, and incongruent with the circumstances. I know this isn’t the solution to the overall problem, said people still procrastinate after all. But it contributes to my confusion how to approach this in general.

&#x200B;

I’m not clinically depressed. I really wish I was, that would be a comparatively easy solution. But that’s been eliminated by a psychiatrist for a while. I can’t seek psychiatric help either, though. In my country, ever since the lockdowns, those services have been utterly overwhelmed. If you’re not suffering severely, or aren’t a risk to yourself, or others, there’s simply no space at the moment. Waiting lists for appointments are 6-8 months. However, I need to do something NOW. Even more so, if I need to start with incremental change, which, unless any of you can provide a different epiphany, I obviously do.

&#x200B;

So, I’m turning to this corner of the internet, to see if any of you kind people have experience and input that could be helpful for me. Objectively, I’m good at assessing my situation and what needs to be done, what my needs are, how to provide for them properly, etc. What I struggle with is the application, the methods, the battle between my brain tricking me, and me tricking my brain. And figuring out where to start in this mess. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.

(Also, this has bloated a lot. If you’ve read this far, that deserves a Thank you all on its own. So thank you.)","Hey, I have been having similar feelings since the pandemic. I can really relate to your post and sadly I don't have much advice to offer. But know that you're not alone in this.","Unfortunately, I have experienced the same struggles with discipline. Regardless of what issue I was trying to solve, be it drinking, pornography addiction, not focusing on my education, I just couldn't stay motivated to keep at it. It was a never ending cycle of me not feeling proud of myself. It also doesn't help that I couldn't seem to find any meaning in my day to day actions.
  

  
Something that really helped me was setting short term goals for myself instead of big commitments. It made me feel optimistic and much more enthusiastic about my commitment to improve myself. I really believe focusing on doing something hard regularly is key to gain control. I urge you guys to also set yourself some attainable 
  
standards which you can pursue, instead of blowing the expectations you have for yourself to an unreachable degree.
  

  
I will share a resource which has helped me, and hopefully it can help you too. The website is provocatio.net, and they basically give you instructions on what physical exercises to do during the week. It gave me structure and mental strength which reminds me that I am improving as an individual.
  

  
Good luck guys. Hopefully we all become stronger.","Hey there! First off, kudos for reaching out and being so open about what you're dealing with. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're looking for solutions is a great first step.

Let's tackle this one step at a time. Since you mentioned that you can get yourself to the gym despite not liking it, you already have some discipline muscles to flex. Try applying that same mindset to other areas. Start small—pick one task you've been avoiding and commit to working on it for just 5 minutes. Often, the hardest part is starting, and once you do, you might find it easier to keep going.

For the procrastination and avoidance, try setting up a simple reward system. After completing a task, even a small one, give yourself a little treat or break. This can help rewire your brain to associate completing tasks with positive outcomes.

Regarding the lying and avoidance, it might help to practice being more honest with yourself first. When you catch yourself about to lie, pause and ask why you're doing it. Sometimes just acknowledging the truth to yourself can be a powerful step toward change.

Lastly, since you mentioned anxiety about going out, try to gradually expose yourself to these situations. Start with something low-stakes and build up from there. It might also help to have a friend or family member accompany you for support.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've got this!","Thanks for sharing your situation so openly. The good news is that you already have some discipline (as shown by your gym habit) and strong self-awareness about your patterns. That's actually a huge advantage for making changes.

Let's focus on starting small and building from there. Since you mentioned needing to do something NOW, here's what I suggest:

Start with a 5-minute rule for tasks you're avoiding. When you notice yourself going into avoidance mode, commit to just 5 minutes of the important task. Often you'll find yourself continuing past those 5 minutes once you've broken through the initial resistance. If not, that's okay too - you still did something productive.

For the lying habit, try replacing it with a simple ""I'll get back to you on that"" when asked about plans or progress. This gives you space to think and respond truthfully without the pressure of an immediate answer. The key is breaking the reflexive response pattern.

Regarding the agoraphobia and anxiety around appointments - start by making one important call or handling one piece of bureaucracy first thing in the morning, before your brain has time to build up resistance. Morning tends to be when our willpower is strongest.

The emotional dampening and autopilot behavior you described often comes from being overwhelmed. Try keeping a simple done list (not a to-do list) where you write down what you actually accomplished each day, even tiny things. This creates awareness of your patterns and gives you small wins to build on.

Remember: you don't need to fix everything at once. Pick ONE of these suggestions to try for a week. Track how it goes. Then either adjust or add another small change. The goal isn't perfection - it's progress.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share the struggles you're facing, so kudos to you for taking this first step. It's clear that you have a good understanding of your situation and what needs to change, but as you said, the application and methods are where you're getting stuck. 

One thing that might be helpful is to start small and focus on building one habit at a time. You mentioned that you're able to get yourself to the gym regularly, which is a great example of discipline in action. Could you try to apply some of the same strategies that work for you with exercise to other areas of your life? For instance, you might start by committing to a tiny, daily task related to one of your problem areas, like making a phone call or working on a project for just 10 minutes a day.

It's also interesting that you mention lying as a way to avoid discomfort or explanation. This might be worth exploring further, as it could be related to some deeper issues with self-compassion or fear of judgment. Practicing honesty with yourself and others, even in small ways, could help build trust and reduce the need for avoidance behaviors.

Lastly, since you can't seek psychiatric help right now, you might look into online resources like therapy apps, podcasts, or YouTube channels focused on productivity, anxiety, and personal development. These can provide some guidance and support while you're waiting for more formal help.

Remember that developing discipline and changing habits takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You don't have to tackle everything at once, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. What do you think might be the smallest, most manageable change you could make this week to get started?","Okay, I read your whole post. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're self-aware enough to analyze all this is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much – you're clearly capable of change, as you mentioned with the gym.

Since you're feeling overwhelmed, let's focus on one small win to start. Forget the big picture for now. Pick *one* thing you've been procrastinating on – something small, like making a single phone call or sending one email. Commit to doing *just that one thing* tomorrow morning. Don't think about anything else on your to-do list. Just that one task.

To combat the autopilot avoidance, try this: set an alarm on your phone for a specific time tomorrow morning (say, 9:00 AM). When it goes off, immediately do that one task. No excuses, no ""just five more minutes"" – just do it. The key is to break the cycle of avoidance *before* it starts.

Regarding the lying, maybe try a little experiment. For one day, just focus on telling the truth, even if it's uncomfortable. You don't have to over-explain, just be honest about what you're doing and how you're feeling. See how it goes. It might feel weird at first, but it could also be liberating.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix everything overnight. It's about making small, consistent changes over time. Celebrate those small wins, and don't get discouraged by setbacks. You got this.

t3_oh4l5b,[NEED ADVICE] Constantly self sabotaging and giving up on projects/career prospect when I start to get good at it.,"Context: Growing up, I was constantly praised for being “smart” because I enjoyed many things (especially creative endeavors) and being praised for them helped me excelled at many of the things I do. This is a double edge sword because I tend not to try as hard, often relying on my “talent” when needed and only picking up things that peak my interest or doing things I know I’ll be good at (thus, receiving more praise). The ego, I know. 

Well, fast forward to the ensuing detrimental consequences that is my current present, I [22F] have dropped out of college (because I didn’t enjoy it and felt like it was a waste of time and money) and have since picked up many interesting projects and explored many business ideas and have excelled in them but once I reach a point where they are considered “good/successful” I give up because I no longer enjoy it. This really sucks because I can’t build anything for myself long term and I can’t work towards anything in the long run. I really envy those who can work on a project for years (and enjoy it) and end up with something to show for it. Tbh, I really do try to push myself forward with it but it feels as though there is a huge wall of resistance pushing me back and I find myself hating the project or I’ll procrastinate. I’m not sure if there is some hidden insecurity or fear of failure thats holding me back… not to mention I have horrible self discipline. Any advice at all will be appreciated!",,,"It sounds like you're dealing with a classic case of the ""shiny object syndrome,"" where the initial excitement of a new project fades once the novelty wears off. One approach to tackle this is to start small and build consistency. Pick one project that you feel has potential and set a small, manageable goal for it. Commit to working on it for a set amount of time each day or week, even if it's just 15-30 minutes. This helps build discipline and makes the task less daunting. Also, try to shift your focus from the end result to the process itself. Find joy in the daily grind and the small wins along the way. It might also help to have an accountability partner or join a community where you can share your progress and challenges. Remember, it's okay to not love every moment of the work; the key is to push through those moments and keep going. Good luck!","Your pattern is actually pretty common - the ""gifted kid"" path where early praise for natural abilities can make it harder to push through challenges later. The good news is you've already identified the core issue, which is half the battle.

Here's what's likely happening: You're great at the initial learning phase where progress comes quickly, but you hit resistance when things require more deliberate effort to improve. This is when most people either need to develop new skills or refine existing ones through repetition - it's less exciting than the early phase.

Try this approach: Pick your next project with the explicit goal of pushing through that resistance point. When you feel that wall coming up, recognize it as a signal that you're entering the growth phase rather than a sign to quit. Set concrete milestones beyond the ""good enough"" stage where you usually stop.

The key is to shift your mindset from ""I do this because I'm good at it"" to ""I do this because I want to master it."" This means accepting that some days will feel like a grind, and that's okay. Start small - commit to just 30 minutes of focused work when you hit that resistance. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you get started.

Remember that mastery isn't about constant enjoyment - it's about finding satisfaction in the process of improvement itself. The people you admire who stick with projects for years have learned this. They've developed a different relationship with their work where progress, not praise, becomes the reward.

You might want to start with something you genuinely care about beyond just being good at it. What would you want to build or create even if no one ever praised you for it?","It sounds like you're struggling with a pattern of behavior that's held you back from achieving long-term success, despite your natural talents and interests. One thing that stands out is your tendency to rely on innate ability rather than putting in consistent effort, which can make it difficult to develop the resilience and discipline needed to push through challenges. 

When you start to feel that wall of resistance or boredom with a project, try to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks that focus on the process rather than the end result. This can help make the work feel less overwhelming and more enjoyable. Additionally, consider setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, both short-term and long-term, to give you a sense of direction and motivation.

It might also be helpful to explore why you're giving up on projects when they start to gain traction. Is it fear of failure, fear of success, or something else entirely? Reflecting on your motivations and values can help you better understand what's driving your behavior and make changes accordingly. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about your self-discipline - it's a skill that can be developed over time with practice and patience. Start small by building habits and routines that work for you, and gradually increase the difficulty as you become more comfortable. Remember, it's okay to not be perfect, and it's normal for progress to be slow and uneven. The key is to keep moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That ""gifted kid burnout"" is a real thing. It sounds like you're hitting a point where the initial novelty wears off and the real work begins, and that's when the motivation tanks.

A couple of things that might help:

First, try focusing on the *process* instead of the outcome. You mentioned envying people who can work on projects for years. Maybe try to find enjoyment in the daily grind, the small improvements, and the problem-solving aspects. Can you break down your projects into smaller, more manageable tasks and celebrate those mini-wins?

Second, explore *why* you're giving up. Is it truly boredom, or is there a fear of not being ""perfect"" at the next level? If it's the latter, maybe try reframing ""success"" as learning and growth, not just achieving a specific outcome. Failure is part of the process, and it's how we improve.

Third, consider finding an accountability partner or joining a community related to your projects. Having someone to check in with and share your progress can provide external motivation and help you stay on track when your own motivation wanes.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to experiment and explore different paths. The key is to learn from each experience and keep moving forward, even if it's in a slightly different direction. Good luck!

t3_zoz1hu,[Need Advice] How can I get disciplined when I don't care about my goals?,"Repost because I forgot flair, sorry

I understand that motivation is fleeting. I understand one needs to use discipline instead, to do it even if they don't feel like it.

The problem is, I don't even get fleeting motivation. I understand motivation is not helpful for actually completing tasks, but I get the sense that it's somewhat necessary for original goal setting. I can't set meaningful goals at all.

There's nothing I really want. Sure, every once in a while I think something might be nice, but then I think a little harder about what actually would happen, and realize that I actually am not interested in it at all. For example, I might randomly think ""hey wouldn't it be cool to play the piano"" but I have no real desire or emotion attached to it, and once I picture myself having learned to play the piano, I wouldn't want to play anyway, I wouldn't care that I could play, I just wouldn't really get anything out of it at all. That's not even counting all the effort in hypothetically learning how to play. I can't think of any goal that would really have any long term positive benefit that would outweigh the upfront pain and discipline.

This makes goal setting seem like an exercise in futility. Every single idea I come up with seems as random and pointless as if I randomly strung together a sentence. Getting better at math or reading a book or whatever, when I truly don't care about it and don't see any way I could apply the skills to get any benefit, looks exactly the same to me as ""My goal will be... 'Balance'... 'Shoe'... 'Under'... 'Knee'"". My response is always immediate bewilderment and a resounding *why?!*

I swear, I don't need a huge why. I regularly push through pain at work because an employee gets the job done until they decide to formally quit. I respond to emails and texts promptly no matter how anxious or busy or whatever I am because it shows respect. I do fine with health-related goals, because I can see the benefits of having more strength and energy, and ultimately staying healthy and independent for longer.

The problem is with self-improvement or overall living a more disciplined life, things I know I ""should"" do but can't really find any reason why. I'm just not a very disciplined person. I know discipline > motivation. But I just don't understand what the point of, for example, developing a hobby is, if all it really is doing something you hate just so you can get better at something you hate just for what, masochism brownie points?

This lack of discipline is starting to become even more problematic. I'm at an age where I need to apply to colleges and decide what I'm going to do, and I just can't bring myself to study and apply anymore. I've never had problems in school in the past, but I just can't see any benefits of going to college vs going to trade school. I have no interests, as long as I make enough to eat it's all the same to me. So it's not that I don't want to work on applications, it's that I don't want the applications to be done. I don't want to get good grades. It's suddenly very hard to muster up discipline to work towards things I don't actually want to happen.

I've tried just pushing through and following random goals for the discipline. I always heard that motivation will eventually follow action. This never happens. I start off trying to ignore my misgivings and just do it, over time (like for months, I am giving it a bit of a chance) I come to hate it more and more, and eventually the stress of trying to continue force myself starts carrying over into other areas of my life, until finally I admit that I hate it and I'm not going to get any foreseeable benefits and it's only getting worse. I give in and show that I don't have discipline after all. This hits especially hard with hobbies, because they require so much discipline, and there's no real reason for them other than personal fulfillment and enjoyment, which I never feel no matter how long I force myself or how good I get.

Then I hear on here that it never ends. You always have to use discipline. It's always a struggle. I just don't understand why I should try to be disciplined, if I'll always only struggle and never get any benefit.

People always say that the pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret, but what do you do when you genuinely just don't feel regret? Admittedly I'm young, but I've never regretted missing out on opportunities or not doing enough. I've only ever regretted working so hard at things that didn't matter, I wish I could've rested and relaxed more, and I wish I wouldn't have ruined the few interests I had trying to turn them into hobbies. I've always been more laid-back and don't really dwell on potential life paths anyway. Nothing is really important to me except my health which I already work to maintain, nothing really interests me enough to outweigh the pain of discipline.

With this attitude, it's very difficult to see why I should even bother. I know that ultimately I'm just whining, but I was just wondering if anyone knew what could help with this, or at least if anyone else is in the same boat? Is there anything I'm just not thinking of? Is it really just an unrealistic expectation to have a reason or a bit of motivation while setting goals? If they won't be meaningful anyway, what goals do I set, how do I even know I'm setting the right ones? Or am I just making a lot of excuses and I just need a swift kick in the pants lol

Basically, how to find the motivation to use discipline in the first place?","Do you have any parents to provide structure and impetus to your life? Few young people ever ""reasoned"" themselves into better habits all by themselves.",I'm the excact same,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's understandable to feel stuck when nothing seems to spark genuine interest. One approach you might consider is focusing on small, low-pressure experiments rather than setting big goals. Instead of committing to a hobby or a path, try exploring different activities with a mindset of curiosity rather than obligation. For example, you could try a new activity for just 10 minutes a day or once a week, without any expectation of sticking with it long-term. This way, you might stumble upon something that naturally piques your interest without the pressure of turning it into a goal.

Also, consider reframing discipline as a tool for self-discovery rather than self-improvement. It's not just about achieving something but about learning more about what you enjoy or value. Sometimes, the act of doing can lead to unexpected insights about what matters to you. Lastly, it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Life is a series of experiments, and it's perfectly fine to take your time finding what resonates with you.","Your post really resonates because it highlights a common catch-22: it's hard to build discipline without having meaningful goals, but it's hard to find meaningful goals without some initial spark of interest or motivation.

Here's what I suggest: instead of trying to manufacture interest in random hobbies or forcing yourself to set arbitrary goals, start by examining what already drives your existing behaviors. You mentioned you consistently handle work responsibilities, maintain your health, and respond promptly to communications. These aren't random - they align with your values of reliability, independence, and respect for others.

Try building on these existing foundations. Rather than asking ""what hobby should I force myself to do?"", ask ""what would help me become even more reliable/independent/respectful?"" This shifts the focus from trying to generate artificial interests to expanding on values you already demonstrate.

For the college situation - instead of trying to manufacture passion for a specific field, approach it through the lens of expanding your capacity for independence and reliability. What path would give you the most options and flexibility? What skills would make you a more capable person overall?

The goal isn't to suddenly become passionate about everything. It's about recognizing that discipline can serve your existing values, even if you don't feel motivated about specific activities. Start small - pick one area where being more disciplined would directly support something you already care about, even if the individual tasks themselves don't excite you.

Remember that not everyone needs to be passionate about their work or have intense hobbies. There's nothing wrong with being laid-back. The key is building discipline in service of the few things you do genuinely value, rather than trying to force yourself to care about things that truly don't matter to you.","It sounds like you're struggling to find meaning or purpose in setting goals, which is making it hard for you to develop discipline. One thing that might help is to focus on the process rather than the end result. Instead of thinking about what you want to achieve, think about what kind of person you want to be or how you want to show up in your daily life. For example, do you want to be someone who is reliable and responsible? Do you want to be able to tackle challenges head-on? 

You mentioned that you're able to push through pain at work and respond to emails promptly because it shows respect, which suggests that you value being a respectful and responsible person. Maybe you can use those values as a starting point for developing discipline in other areas of your life. It's not about finding a specific goal that motivates you, but about cultivating habits and behaviors that align with your values.

It might also be helpful to start small and focus on building discipline in tiny ways, like creating a daily routine or setting aside a few minutes each day for self-reflection. These small wins can add up over time and help you build confidence in your ability to follow through on commitments. 

As for finding motivation, it's possible that you're looking at it the wrong way. Instead of waiting for motivation to strike, try to focus on building curiosity. What are you interested in learning more about? What problems do you want to solve? Even if you don't feel passionate about something, you might be curious about it, and that can be enough to get you started.

Lastly, it's worth considering that discipline is not just about achieving specific goals, but also about developing a sense of self-awareness and self-regulation. By cultivating discipline, you're not just working towards external outcomes, but also building your internal capacity to navigate life's challenges. That in itself can be a powerful motivator, even if you don't have a specific goal in mind.","Okay, I get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're in a bit of a motivational rut, and forcing yourself into things just makes it worse. The whole ""discipline for discipline's sake"" thing can feel pretty pointless when you don't see the point.

Maybe the problem isn't a lack of discipline, but a lack of direction. You're trying to apply discipline to goals that don't resonate, and that's a recipe for burnout. Instead of focusing on grand self-improvement projects, try experimenting with small, low-stakes things. Think of it as gathering data, not committing to a lifestyle.

For example, instead of ""learn piano,"" try ""spend 15 minutes exploring a free online piano lesson."" No pressure to become a concert pianist, just a tiny experiment to see if anything sparks your interest. If it doesn't, no big deal, move on to something else. The key is to remove the pressure of long-term commitment and focus on the immediate experience.

As for college vs. trade school, maybe talk to people in both fields. Shadow someone for a day. See what their actual day-to-day looks like. Don't just think about the end result, but the process itself. Which path seems more tolerable, or even mildly interesting?

Also, it's okay not to have a burning passion right now. A lot of people don't. Focus on building a life that's sustainable and allows you to explore different options. Maybe that means finding a job that pays the bills and leaves you with enough free time to try new things without feeling overwhelmed.

Finally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore your values and identify what truly matters to you, without the pressure of having to ""fix"" yourself. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Don't beat yourself up for not being ""disciplined"" enough. Focus on finding something that makes you want to be.

I think some of it might have to do with the longer days (the sun going down at 9 definitely changes the game).

Quick insights that might help:

    I exercise 3-4 times a week
    I don't consume any alcohol
    I avoid eating after 8

I'm very eager to get back on the 5am train and thankful in advance for any insights!","If you are taking coffee regularly after the noon, stop it.
 Also try taking a 30 min nap after the lunch.
 Don't sleep after 16:00. 
And yes no phone 1 hour before the sleep. I hope that helps",Must admit that the coffee definitely needs to go down a notch.,"It sounds like you've got a solid routine and some good habits in place already, which is great! The change in daylight can definitely throw off your internal clock. Here are a few things you might try: 

1. Gradually adjust your bedtime to ensure you're still getting enough sleep. Even a 15-minute shift earlier can make a difference.
2. Consider using blackout curtains to help your body recognize it's time to wind down, even if it's still light outside.
3. Try a consistent wind-down routine before bed to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could be reading, meditating, or any relaxing activity.
4. If you haven't already, try using a sunrise alarm clock. It simulates a natural sunrise, which can help you wake up more naturally and feel more refreshed.

Remember, it's okay to have fluctuations in your routine. Be patient with yourself as you adjust. Good luck getting back to your 5am mornings!","The longer summer days definitely mess with our circadian rhythms! Your previous routine sounds solid, but you might need to adjust a few things to get back on track. Since you're already avoiding late meals and alcohol while staying active, let's focus on your wind-down routine.

Try gradually dimming lights in your home starting around 7:30-8pm. Your body needs that darkness signal, especially when it's still bright outside. Blackout curtains can also help create an artificial sunset in your bedroom.

What time are you actually going to bed? With a 5am wake time, you'll want to be asleep by 9:30pm latest to get enough rest. You might need to temporarily shift your bedtime 15-30 minutes earlier until your body readjusts.

One trick that works well is setting a ""sunset alarm"" - when it goes off, start your evening routine regardless of how light it is outside. Your body will eventually catch on.

Keep your morning wake-up time consistent (even on weekends) and get some early morning sunlight when you first get up. This helps reset your internal clock. Give these adjustments about two weeks to really stick. You've done this successfully before, so it's just a matter of recalibrating to the seasonal change.","It's not uncommon for our routines to get disrupted by seasonal changes, so don't be too hard on yourself. The longer days can definitely affect our sleep patterns and motivation. Considering you've been consistent with your exercise routine and have healthy habits like avoiding late-night eating and alcohol, it's likely just a matter of adjusting to the new daylight schedule. Have you tried keeping your wake-up time consistent on weekends as well? Sometimes, allowing ourselves to sleep in on weekends can make it harder to get back into the early riser routine during the week. You might also want to try setting a consistent bedtime schedule and creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down, regardless of the sun still being up. Lastly, remind yourself why waking up at 5am was important to you in the first place - what were you using that time for, and how did it make you feel? Refocusing on those benefits might help you regain your motivation to get back on track.","Hey, that's a bummer when a good routine gets derailed! It happens to the best of us. Since you've already built the habit, that's a huge plus – it's way easier to restart than to start from scratch.

A few thoughts: First, the longer days are definitely a factor. Our bodies are sensitive to light. Maybe try blackout curtains if you don't already have them? Even a small amount of light can mess with your sleep.

Second, re-evaluate your bedtime. If the sun's setting later is throwing you off, you might need to adjust when you're hitting the hay to still get those solid hours of sleep. Experiment with going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier for a few nights and see if that helps.

Third, consider a gradual reset. Instead of jumping straight back to 5 am, try waking up at 5:30 am for a few days, then 6 am, and slowly work your way back. This can be less jarring on your system.

Finally, remember why you enjoyed those early mornings in the first place. Reconnecting with that motivation can give you the extra push you need. Good luck getting back on track!

t3_wv84fv,[need advice] wtf am I doing with my life,"The question of the century, and the answers are always very broad. Do what makes you happy. Life is short. 

I(25f) don't necessarily want anyone to tell me what to do with my life... I'd just like some guidance and maybe an example or two.

I love animals... ""so become a vet""... well, I'm too emotional, I don't think I could ever put a pet down without crying my eyes out every time.

I love design... ""become a designer""... that involves going to school and I don't feel confident I'd have the discipline for that.

Get married. Have children. Start a business. Go to school. 

Well.... WTF do you want? 

I'm not really sure. I love so many things, and I've never been afraid of anything really. I just never know where to start, when to end. I know I'm an overthinker.. and I've finally learned how to put myself first and to love myself again recently... but what's next?? 


If I go back to school, where do I start? Do I have to work full time AND go to school? And maintain a healthy relationship?
How do people do it :(","You seems to be too confused about your priorities & interests. You are 25 but you are confused like a child who doesn't know what subjects or career to choose. You need to think what type of work you wanna do - based on your graduation or your other interests/ aspirations. Talk to your family, friends for guidance."," Eventually, you'll just had to stop thinking and just CHOOSE!  Too many choices is paralyzing and no one path is going to be ""perfect"".......eventually just make a choice! Jump off that cliff! And do your best! You can always go back and jump off a different cliff later if you need to. :D","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a place where you're exploring your options, which is a great start. It's totally okay to not have everything figured out at 25. Here are a few thoughts that might help you find some direction:

1. **Start Small**: If you're interested in design but unsure about school, try taking a few online courses or workshops. This can help you gauge your interest and build some foundational skills without a huge commitment.

2. **Explore Your Passions**: Since you love animals, maybe look into volunteering at a shelter or working part-time at a pet store. This could give you a sense of fulfillment and help you decide if you want to pursue something more in that field.

3. **Balance and Prioritize**: If you decide to go back to school, consider part-time classes. Many people work and study simultaneously, but it's important to find a balance that works for you. Prioritize what's most important to you right now, whether it's education, work, or relationships.

4. **Set Small Goals**: Overthinking can be paralyzing, so try setting small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as dedicating an hour a day to learning something new or setting aside time each week to explore different interests.

5. **Stay Open and Flexible**: Life is a journey, and it's okay to change paths. What matters is that you're moving forward and learning along the way.

Remember, it's perfectly fine to take your time figuring things out. You're already on the right track by putting yourself first and exploring what you love. Good luck!","Hey there! At 25, it's totally normal to feel uncertain about your path - many of us have been there. Instead of trying to figure out your entire life right now, let's break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

First, you don't need to commit to a massive career change immediately. Start by exploring your interests in design and working with animals in small ways. You could volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends or take some free online design courses (like on Coursera or YouTube) to test the waters without a huge commitment.

About school - yes, many people work full-time while studying. It's challenging but doable, especially if you start part-time with just 1-2 classes. Community colleges are great for this because they're more affordable and offer flexible schedules. You can always transfer credits later if you decide to pursue a full degree.

The key is to start small and build discipline gradually. Pick ONE thing - maybe a single evening class or a weekend volunteer position - and commit to it for 3 months. Use that experience to learn about yourself and what you actually enjoy doing (not just what you think you might enjoy).

Remember that your first step doesn't have to be your forever step. Many successful people started in one direction and gradually shifted as they learned more about themselves and their interests. The important thing is to start moving forward, even if you're not 100% sure of the destination yet.","It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the possibilities and unsure of how to narrow down your options. One thing that might help is to break down your interests into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, if you love animals, you could start by volunteering at a local shelter or wildlife organization to get a feel for what it's like to work with animals without having to commit to becoming a vet. Similarly, if you're interested in design, you could try taking online courses or attending workshops to see if it's something you enjoy and are good at before deciding whether to pursue further education.

As for going back to school, it's definitely possible to balance it with work and other responsibilities, but it does require some discipline and time management. You might consider starting with a part-time or online program to see how it fits into your schedule. It's also worth looking into programs that offer flexible scheduling or support for working students.

It's great that you've been working on prioritizing yourself and learning to love yourself - that's a huge accomplishment, and it will serve you well as you navigate this next phase of your life. Remember that you don't have to have everything figured out right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You might try setting small, achievable goals for yourself, like taking a certain number of classes or volunteering for a certain number of hours, and see how it goes from there. And don't be afraid to ask for help or advice along the way - that's what this community is here for!","Hey, I get the feeling of being pulled in a million directions. It sounds like you're at a really exciting point, actually – you've figured out self-love, which is HUGE. Now it's about channeling that energy.

Instead of trying to figure out the *one* perfect path, maybe try some smaller experiments. You love design but are worried about school? There are tons of online courses (Skillshare, Coursera, even YouTube) where you can dip your toes in without a huge commitment. See if you enjoy the actual *doing* of design.

As for the ""how do people do it all?"" question – they usually don't, at least not all at once and not perfectly. Start small. If you're thinking about school, maybe take one class to start. See how it fits with your work and relationship. It's okay to adjust as you go.

Discipline isn't about being a robot; it's about making conscious choices and sticking to them *most* of the time. Start with one small habit related to your goals (like 30 minutes of online design tutorials a few times a week) and build from there. You got this!

t3_q2qwpu,The internet craving struggle is real. [Discussion] [Need Advice],"Its been 15 days since i blocked fb, insta, youtube. I allow myself only twitter and linkedin. Friday evening is the exception where the gloves are off and i m free to watch movies, series etc., I m in the mid of 3rd week. Specially wednesdays are the hard days. I really crave for some junk news - e.g., talk shows, game shows, movies/series, random youtube videos etc., Its bloody hard. Last wednesday and today i gave into my craving and watched one hour of a talk show. I dont know what else worthwhile i can do to divert my mind to progress further. I am still happy that I m not as bad as i was 3 weeks back. But i m not there where i want to be.

Changes i observed over these days: 

1. After about 5-6 days, my early mornings are more peaceful. The first half n hr after waking up is not filled with too many thoughts of what all i watched the previous night. That feels sometimes bland but many times fresh start to the day. I have also been having interesting dreams with plot twists etc.,
2. I feel a lot more connected to reality and not living virtually inside my head with continous thoughts of all the scenes and visuals imprints running like a movie.",,,"It sounds like you're making some great progress already, so kudos for that! It's totally normal to have those mid-week slumps where the cravings hit hard. One thing you might try is replacing that craving time with a new hobby or activity that you find engaging. Maybe pick up a book you've been curious about, start a small creative project, or even go for a walk or exercise. These can serve as a good distraction and help build new habits. Also, consider setting a specific goal for your Friday ""gloves off"" time, like watching a particular movie or series, so it feels more intentional and rewarding. Keep celebrating the small wins, like your peaceful mornings and feeling more connected to reality. You're on the right track!","You're making great progress! Those positive changes you've noticed - especially the peaceful mornings and feeling more connected to reality - are significant wins that show you're on the right track. 

For those tough Wednesday cravings, try having a few specific alternative activities ready to go. Reading a good book, going for a walk, calling a friend, or working on a hobby project can help redirect that entertainment-seeking energy. The key is to make these alternatives easily accessible so when the craving hits, you have something concrete to turn to.

Consider tracking your cravings in a simple note on your phone - just jot down when they happen and what triggered them. This can help you spot patterns and prepare better for those challenging moments. Also, instead of viewing that hour of talk show as a failure, treat it as data - what specifically led to that moment, and how can you plan differently next time?

Your Friday exception rule is smart - having a designated time for entertainment makes it easier to stay disciplined the rest of the week. Maybe add one more structured ""mini-break"" midweek? Something like 30 minutes of carefully chosen content could help manage those Wednesday struggles while keeping your overall goals intact.

Keep building on those positive changes. You've already proven you can make significant improvements in just a few weeks - that's something to be proud of.","It's great that you've made it 15 days without Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, and that you're allowing yourself some flexibility on Fridays. Those Wednesday cravings can be tough, but it's good that you're acknowledging them and looking for ways to manage them. One strategy you might try is finding alternative activities that bring you a similar sense of relaxation or entertainment, like reading a book, taking a walk, or practicing a hobby. It's also interesting that you've noticed changes in your mornings and your connection to reality - those are some great benefits to build on. Since you mentioned you gave in to your cravings last Wednesday and today, maybe try to identify what triggers those cravings on Wednesdays specifically, and see if you can plan something else to look forward to on that day. You've made progress and that's something to be proud of, so keep pushing forward and experimenting with new habits.","Hey, congrats on making it 15 days! That's a solid start, and it sounds like you're already seeing some real benefits. Don't beat yourself up too much about the occasional slip-up; it's part of the process.

Since Wednesdays are tough, maybe try planning something specific for those evenings *before* the craving hits. Think about what kind of activity would genuinely engage you and provide a similar kind of mental break, but without the junk content. Could be a workout, meeting up with a friend, working on a hobby project, reading a book, or even just going for a walk in nature. The key is to have a pre-planned alternative ready to go.

Also, consider *why* you're craving that junk news. Is it boredom? Stress? Loneliness? Identifying the trigger can help you find a more effective and healthy way to deal with it. Maybe you need to incorporate more relaxation techniques into your routine, or find ways to connect with people offline.

Finally, remember to focus on the positives you've already noticed – the peaceful mornings and feeling more connected. Keep reminding yourself of those benefits when the cravings get strong. You've got this!

t3_ujj9vn,[Need Advice] How to control your sexual desires and urges,"I'm a young 23 years old single Man. I don't have a much active dating life, and I'm a virgin. 
But that's not the issue, I'm fine with being single, I'm focused on my goals and life. 
But sometimes I have these intense sexual urges, and I would usually mastrubate

But I have gone no Fap for almost a week and don't plan on giving up easily this time

But I still get these sexual urges when I see someone hot in real or on social media or randomly during night

How do I stop this or get a control over it? 

Would really appreciate help here!","Bro i suggest you one thing....
Forget about nofap.... 
Nofap is not something that you do..
Have you notice that whenever you work for something by giving you 100% you forget about fapping. 
That's what you should be doing. 
If you do something which means a lot to you and if you work 100% on it. Then nofap will naturally work. You don't have to think about it.
I am also going this. I wasted 2 years trying to ""do"" nofap alone. 
That's not how it work bro. Do your best on anything you love. 
All the best 🔥🔥💪💪💪","I found NoFap about 7 years ago now. Prior to it, all my roommates openly talked about porn, how many tabs they had open on their browser at night, etc. Like most early 20's males, porn was just considered normal.

I do think refraining from excessive masturbation or even masturbation at all is a good thing. Ideally you want a partner to be enjoying that shit with, but that's not an option for many in certain times of their life and that's ok too. The main issue I see with porn/masturbation for guys is they use it as a crutch. If you can just go fap to some hot internet girl, why go to the gym? Why strive for a better job? Why go out and meet real girls? Why try different things with your girlfriend or wife? All that requires effort, putting yourself out there, etc.

If you're doing it every night, multiple times a day, or using it as 'escapism' for stress or your problems when things get tough, that's when it can be an issue. However on the flip side, the NoFap community makes it out to be completely evil and like you should never fap, ever. It's very very very hard to just never do it ever again. The goal to them is to go on these 100, 200, 300+ day streaks and count days... which ultimately isn't sustainable. And when you do fail, it's very easy to really beat yourself up over it.

The better thing to focus on is ""not watching porn"" rather than ""stopping masturbation"". You don't want to be addicted to overstimulated porn images, which many times makes real sex boring and guys can't get hard. 

Per Chinese medicine there are rules for how many nuts you should be busting per every few days. I believe for someone in their 20's it's about every 3-4 days... any more and they believed you were basically ""wasting your lifeforce"". IMO, this really just means you're too focused on sex and should be focusing on other things in life.

IMO, reset your goals. Striving for 30 days or something to start is good. Make absolutely sure you know WHY you're doing this. If there's no WHY, when you're stressed, it's before bed, etc. you'll just rationalize it's ok and do it - this is why everyone fails.

Realize you're probably going to fail. Right now you'll swear up and down you won't, but 10 days in, 20 days in.... you'll give in or at least want to. That's when it really starts.

Delete any saved porn you have. Use a porn blocker to block websites as another means to stop yourself - it might not totally stop you as you can turn it off, but at least it's another step. Don't take devices into your room at night.

Biggest tip: Go do other shit. Get a main hobby. Dive more into your current hobbies. Lift. Run. You're going to have to focus on and do other things.

And good luck.","Hey there! It's great that you're focused on your goals and looking to build discipline. Managing sexual urges is a common challenge, and it's all about finding balance. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. **Mindful Awareness**: When you feel an urge, try to pause and acknowledge it without judgment. Sometimes just recognizing the feeling can reduce its power.

2. **Redirect Your Energy**: Engage in activities that require focus and energy, like exercise, a hobby, or learning something new. This can help channel your urges into something productive.

3. **Limit Triggers**: If social media or certain environments trigger these urges, consider setting boundaries. Maybe limit your time on those platforms or unfollow accounts that aren't helping your goals.

4. **Practice Relaxation Techniques**: Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help calm your mind and reduce the intensity of urges.

5. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of focusing on a long streak, try setting smaller, achievable goals. Celebrate each milestone to keep motivated.

Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep moving forward and learning what works best for you. Good luck!","Sexual urges are completely natural and nothing to feel ashamed about. The key isn't to eliminate these feelings (which isn't possible or healthy), but rather to channel that energy productively.

First, consider reducing triggers - limiting social media use and being mindful of what content you consume can help reduce the frequency and intensity of urges. But beyond that, the best approach is to stay actively engaged in other pursuits when these feelings arise.

Exercise is particularly effective - when you feel those urges coming on, try going for a run, doing pushups, or hitting the gym. Physical activity naturally redirects that energy while releasing endorphins. Plus, regular exercise helps regulate hormones and reduce stress.

Other helpful strategies include:
- Getting outside and changing your environment
- Diving into an engaging hobby or project
- Meditation and breathing exercises
- Cold showers (seriously, they work)
- Staying social and around other people

Remember that this isn't about suppression - it's about having a toolkit of healthy alternatives to redirect that energy. Keep building positive habits and stay focused on your goals. The urges won't disappear completely, but they'll become easier to manage as you develop these alternative outlets.

You're already showing great discipline with your current streak. Keep that momentum going by staying active and engaged in other aspects of your life.","Controlling sexual desires and urges can be challenging, but it's great that you're taking steps to manage them and stay committed to your goals. First, acknowledge that having sexual urges is completely normal, especially at your age. The key is learning how to redirect those feelings in a healthy way. 

One strategy you might find helpful is to focus on physical activity when you feel the urge rising. Exercise can help reduce tension and shift your mind away from sexual thoughts. Additionally, engaging in hobbies or creative pursuits can serve as a distraction and outlet for your energy.

It's also important to be mindful of your social media use and the content you consume. If certain types of posts or accounts trigger these urges, it might be wise to limit your exposure or take breaks from those platforms.

Developing a consistent daily routine that includes time for self-care, productivity, and relaxation can help regulate your thoughts and feelings. Ensure you're getting enough sleep, as lack of rest can increase susceptibility to impulsive behaviors.

Remember, overcoming sexual urges is not about suppressing them entirely but about learning to manage them in a way that aligns with your personal values and goals. It might be helpful to explore resources or support groups focused on sexual health and self-control for additional guidance and community support.

Keep in mind that it's okay to experience setbacks, and it doesn't mean you've failed. Each day is a new opportunity to make choices that support your objectives. Stay committed, and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. You're on the right path by acknowledging your desires and seeking ways to manage them healthily.","Hey man, congrats on making it a week! That's a solid start. Dealing with urges is tough, but definitely manageable.

First, understand that those urges are totally normal. You're a healthy 23-year-old, so don't beat yourself up for having them. The key is to redirect that energy.

When you feel an urge coming on, try to immediately switch gears. Get up and do something physical – push-ups, a quick walk, anything to get your blood flowing. Even just splashing cold water on your face can help break the cycle.

Another thing that works for a lot of people is finding a replacement activity. Something engaging that occupies your mind. Maybe dive into a book, work on a hobby, or call a friend. The goal is to shift your focus away from the urge.

Also, be mindful of your triggers. If you know that scrolling through social media makes things worse, try to limit your time on those platforms, especially when you're feeling vulnerable.

Finally, remember that discipline isn't about perfection, it's about progress. You're going to slip up sometimes, and that's okay. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Don't let a single slip-up derail your entire goal. You got this!

t3_rygxb9,[Need Advice] How do I un-fuck my life?,"So I'm 18, no job, and I kinda fucked up my college life. I haven't done a single thing for the first semester of college and now my second semester is coming up in a few days, and now one of my scholarship funding sources are asking for my grades. WHAT DO I DO?!

You might be wondering how this happened...well...

I have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my ""content"", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.

Another problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.

Even when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.

Now back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say ""I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester"", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say ""just do it"", but it doesn't work like that.

For stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination. Could I get some strong advice for someone who has suffered through a strong addiction of some sort?

Edit: Should I skip this second semester entirely to fix myself before I get back to college? ","I do a LOT better if I study on campus in the library, rather than at home around my home computer. It’s so hard to work at the place I also play games (and more lol).",Sounds like you could have ADHD.,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—recognizing the need for change is a big first step. Let's tackle this one step at a time.

For your college situation, honesty is usually the best policy. It might be tough, but consider having a candid conversation with your dad and the scholarship committee. Explain that you struggled with the transition and are actively working on improving. They might appreciate your honesty and determination to do better.

Regarding your habits, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. Since blockers haven't worked, try changing your environment. If possible, study in a library or a café where distractions are minimized. Also, set small, achievable goals for each day. Instead of thinking about the entire semester, focus on completing one assignment or studying for one hour. Celebrate these small wins to build momentum.

For the social anxiety, consider reaching out to your college's counseling services. They can offer support and strategies to manage anxiety, which might help you feel more comfortable tackling these conversations and responsibilities.

Lastly, about skipping the semester, weigh the pros and cons. If you think taking a break will help you reset and come back stronger, it might be worth considering. But if you feel you can manage with some adjustments, maybe try to push through with a lighter course load.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to ask for help along the way. You've got this!","First - don't skip next semester. Taking a break won't magically fix these issues, and it's harder to return once you step away. Instead, let's tackle this head-on.

You need to come clean with your dad and the scholarship office ASAP. It's going to be rough, but being honest now is better than letting it get worse. Explain that you struggled with the transition to college and managing your time, but you have a concrete plan to improve (which we'll get to). Most scholarship programs have academic probation periods rather than immediate cancellation.

For the addiction and procrastination - your brain is stuck in a dopamine loop. Those quick hits from games and adult content are way more appealing than delayed rewards from studying. The kitchen wandering is your brain seeking novelty when deprived of its usual stimulation.

Here's what you do:
Start ridiculously small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE class next semester and commit to attending every single lecture, sitting in the front row. Just showing up consistently will begin rewiring your reward pathways.

Get out of your room to study. Go to the library or a coffee shop where you can't access explicit content. The environment change helps break patterns.

Set a timer for just 25 minutes of focused work. When urges hit, tell yourself you only have to wait until the timer ends. Often you'll find you want to continue once you start.

Replace the gaming/adult content with something physical - pushups, walking, anything. You need an alternative outlet for that restless energy.

Most importantly - forgive yourself but don't give up. You're 18 and figuring things out. Many students struggle their first semester. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you want to change. Keep reading Atomic Habits, and remember that small consistent actions compound over time.

You've got this. Start with being honest about where you are, then take it one tiny step at a time.","It sounds like you're facing a tough situation, but acknowledging your problems and seeking help is a huge step forward. First, let's break down the issues into manageable parts. For your college situation, it might be helpful to have an honest conversation with your dad, but maybe frame it as a fresh start for the second semester rather than dwelling on what went wrong in the first. You could say something like, ""I didn't do as well as I hoped last semester, but I'm committed to turning things around this semester."" As for your scholarship, you might want to reach out to them and explain that you're working on getting back on track, and see if they have any resources or support available to help you succeed.

Regarding your procrastination and addiction, it's great that you're looking into ""Atomic Habits"" - the book has some really useful strategies for building positive habits and breaking negative ones. One thing you might find helpful is to start small, like setting aside a specific time each day to work on your goals without any distractions. It could also be beneficial to identify your triggers for procrastination (like the kitchen chair or walking around the house) and find ways to mitigate them, such as investing in a more comfortable chair or finding a different workspace.

It's also important to address your underlying issues, like your hentai addiction and social anxiety. You might consider seeking out professional help, like a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with personalized guidance and support. Additionally, there are many online resources and communities available that can offer help and accountability as you work to overcome your addiction.

As for skipping the second semester, it's not necessarily a bad idea if you feel like you need time to get your life together before diving back into college. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of taking a break, such as losing momentum or falling behind your peers. Maybe you could try to find a compromise, like taking a reduced course load or focusing on one or two classes that you're really interested in, while also working on your personal issues.

Remember, overcoming addiction and building discipline is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be kind to yourself and don't give up - you've already taken the first step by acknowledging your problems and seeking help.","Okay, deep breaths. You're 18, and while it feels like the world is ending, you've got time to turn things around. It's awesome you're already looking into Atomic Habits – that's a solid start.

First, the college stuff. Honesty is the best policy, but it needs to be delivered carefully. With your dad and the scholarship, could you frame it as ""I had a really rough transition to college and struggled more than I anticipated. My grades aren't where they need to be, and I'm working on a plan to improve."" Then, *immediately* follow that with your plan. This shows you're taking responsibility.

As for the plan, consider talking to your college advisor ASAP. Explain the situation. They might have resources like tutoring, counseling, or even a way to retroactively withdraw from some classes. Don't skip the second semester without talking to them first – you might be able to salvage something.

Now, the addiction and procrastination. You're right, ""just do it"" doesn't work. You've identified the triggers (boredom, stress, easy access). Since blockers aren't working, try a more drastic approach: can you move your computer to a more public space in your house? Or even better, do your work at the library? Out of sight, out of mind can be powerful.

Regarding the random kitchen trips and naps, that sounds like avoidance. Your brain is looking for anything other than the task at hand. Break down your work into *tiny* chunks. Like, ""I will work on this assignment for 15 minutes, then take a 5-minute break."" Set a timer. During the break, do something completely different – stretch, listen to music, *not* games or anything addictive. The Pomodoro Technique might be helpful here.

Also, address the chair situation. A comfortable workspace makes a huge difference. Even a cheap ergonomic chair from a used furniture store would be an improvement.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to fix everything overnight. Celebrate small wins. If you manage to work for 30 minutes without distractions, that's a victory! Acknowledge it. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. And seriously, talk to your college advisor. They've seen it all before and can offer valuable guidance. You got this.

t3_t13hfn,"[Need Advice] How to be a more curious person, who is always seeking to learn more?","I find it difficult to stay curious or always be learning. I want to change myself to be a more curious and knowledgeable person

Open to any advice and app/blog recommendations","“Let go of certainty. The opposite isn't uncertainty. It's openness, curiosity and a willingness to embrace paradox, rather than choose up sides. The ultimate challenge is to accept ourselves exactly as we are, but never stop trying to learn and grow.”  
― Tony Schwartz",Make it your username,"Becoming more curious is a great goal! Here are a few tips to help you cultivate that mindset. Start by setting aside a little time each day to explore something new. It could be reading an article, watching a documentary, or listening to a podcast on a topic you know nothing about. Apps like CuriosityStream or Blinkist can be great for this. Also, try to ask more questions in your daily life. When you encounter something you don't understand, make a habit of looking it up. Keeping a journal where you jot down interesting things you learn can also help reinforce your curiosity. Remember, curiosity is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Good luck on your journey!","Here's what's helped me develop more curiosity and a love of learning: start by following your genuine interests rather than forcing yourself to learn random topics. What naturally catches your attention? That's your gateway to building curiosity.

For apps, I recommend Pocket to save interesting articles you come across, and Feedly to follow topics/websites that spark your interest. Reddit itself is great too - join subreddits about topics you want to learn more about.

A practical habit that works well is the ""depth first, then breadth"" approach. When something interests you, dig deeper into that specific topic first. Read about it, watch videos, maybe take a free online course. As you learn more, you'll naturally discover connected topics that branch out into other areas. This creates sustainable curiosity because each new thing builds on what you already know and care about.

Try setting aside 30 minutes each day as dedicated ""learning time."" During this time, explore one topic that genuinely interests you. Take notes, ask questions, look up things you don't understand. Over time, this habit will train your brain to be more naturally curious.

Remember that being curious isn't about knowing everything - it's about maintaining an open, questioning mindset. When you encounter something new, practice asking ""Why?"" and ""How does this work?"" These questions will lead you down interesting paths of discovery.","One strategy that might help is to start small by dedicating a specific time each day or week to exploring something new, whether it's reading an article on a topic you've never learned about before, listening to a podcast on a subject outside your usual interests, or even just asking someone you know about their hobbies. Consistency is key here, so try to make this a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine. You might also find it helpful to keep a ""curiosity journal"" where you write down questions that come up throughout the day and then look into them later - this can help you stay engaged and motivated to learn more. As for resources, there are some great apps like Curious and Coursera that offer bite-sized learning opportunities on a wide range of topics. Blogs like Farnam Street and Wait But Why often feature in-depth explorations of interesting subjects and might help spark some new interests for you. Remember, the goal is to make curiosity a habit, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - just keep at it and be patient with your progress.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough to just *decide* to be more curious. It's more about building habits that naturally lead you there.

One thing that's helped me is to start small and focus on *one* area that genuinely interests you, even a little bit. Don't try to learn everything at once. Maybe it's a specific historical period, a type of music, or even just how your phone works.

Then, make it a habit to spend just 15-20 minutes a day on it. Consistency is key. Use that time to read a blog, watch a documentary, listen to a podcast, or even just browse Wikipedia. The point is to engage with the topic in a way that feels enjoyable, not like a chore.

Also, don't be afraid to ask ""dumb"" questions. Curiosity thrives on asking questions, even if you think you should already know the answer. Sites like Quora or even just Googling things are great for this.

Finally, try to connect what you're learning to your existing interests or daily life. This makes the information more relevant and easier to remember, and it can spark even more curiosity. Good luck!

t3_14h8ope,[Need advice] Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of a slump? My discipline is non-existent at the moment and I feel so lazy. I’m wasting my days and not getting anything meaningful done.,,"Hey just offering some help where i can.  

Currently I am reading a book called “The Gap and the gain”. In it the author describes a concept where many of us are looking at the gaps in our life instead of the gains.  Here’s a scenario:  

Just suppose you’re walking along a paved highway toward a beautiful horizon.  The sun is setting just right, you feel the warm air and maybe even a gentle breeze.  As you’re walking you notice how far you’ve come, that’s living in the gain.  The opposite is focusing on how much further you have to go or living in the gap between where you are and where you have yet to go.  

When we measure success based on how far we’ve come we see what successes we have had up until now.  On the other hand, when we measure success based on how far we have to go we always feel disappointed.  Bc the thing is we can never actually get to the horizon. No matter how far we walk, run, drive.  The horizon isn’t there for us to get to. These are our ideals.  We will never actually measure up to our ideal self (which is usually ego driven). Our focus can always be on how far we’ve come and measure based on that, not how far we “feel” we have yet to go.  Which is usually based on fear of something.","1) exercise. The consistency is much more important than the amount. Do what you can.

2) Establish and follow a routine, especially in terms of your sleep schedule. Get up and get dressed every day, even if you just stay at home.

3) Practice self care. Not just the obvious stuff, either. Respecting yourself enough to keep a clean environment, practice good hygiene, and so on. It makes a surprising difference. 

4) Forgive yourself. The important part is to keep making improvements. It's about the journey much more than the destination - and sometimes we have to take a step or two backwards before we can move on. Small steps.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, and that's totally okay—it happens to all of us. One thing that might help is starting small. Pick one simple task you can do each day, like making your bed or going for a short walk. This can help build a sense of accomplishment and momentum. Also, try setting a routine. Even if it's just waking up at the same time every day, having some structure can make a big difference. Lastly, be kind to yourself. Progress takes time, and it's okay to have off days. You've got this!","Getting back on track after losing discipline is tough, but totally doable. Start small - pick just ONE thing you want to accomplish tomorrow and commit to doing it, no matter how minor it seems. Maybe it's making your bed, going for a 10-minute walk, or reading one page of a book.

The key is building momentum through small wins. Once you complete that first task, you'll likely feel motivated to do a bit more. But don't overwhelm yourself trying to fix everything at once. Focus on that single daily commitment for a week before adding anything else.

Another helpful approach is setting a specific time for your chosen task. ""I'll do it sometime today"" often becomes ""I'll do it tomorrow."" Instead, decide ""I'll do this at 9am"" and treat it like an important appointment.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back up when you slip. Everyone goes through slumps. What matters is taking that first step to break out of it, even if it's a tiny one. Start tomorrow with that one committed task, and build from there.

What's one small thing you could commit to doing tomorrow?","It's normal to go through slumps, and recognizing you're in one is the first step to getting out. One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle everything at once, set a tiny goal for yourself each day, like doing one productive task or exercising for just 10 minutes. Often, getting that little bit of momentum can help build discipline and make it easier to take on more. Additionally, try to identify what's causing your slump - is it lack of motivation, burnout, or something else? Once you understand the root cause, you can start working on a plan to address it. Lastly, be kind to yourself and don't beat yourself up over feeling lazy - it's okay to have off days, and it doesn't define your entire potential. What do you think is the smallest step you could take today to get moving in a positive direction?","Hey, it happens to the best of us! Slumps are tough. Here's what usually helps me:

First, don't beat yourself up about it. That just makes it worse. Acknowledge you're in a slump and that it's temporary.

Second, start ridiculously small. Forget about ""meaningful"" for now. Think *tiny*. Like, ""I will do one push-up"" or ""I will read one page of a book."" The goal is to break the inertia and get a small win. Seriously, one push-up. You'll probably do more, but the pressure is off.

Third, focus on ONE thing. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick the one habit that, if you did it consistently, would make the biggest difference. Maybe it's exercise, maybe it's working on a specific project. Just one.

Finally, be patient and kind to yourself. It takes time to build momentum. Celebrate those small wins and don't get discouraged if you have setbacks. You got this!

t3_uii4x0,"[Need Advice] Messed up my plan for the end of semester, how can I get everything done now??","Hi! Long story short, due to severe procrastination, I've left my undergrad dissertation untouched for almost three months and now I'm starting to panic. I have to write up 25K to 50K words by the end of the month. Good thing is that it's comparative law related and it's mostly reading and gathering information, meaning that I don't have to come up with new data or do any type of experiments.
On the other hand, I (1) also have to start studying for some june finals, that are cumulative, so they'd take a lot of time and (2) I start working the last week of this month. When I signed up for the job I thought I would be done with my dissertation by now, but I'm not.

So, my questions are:
- Would it be possible to get it done in that time? 
- Have any of you gone from total procrastination to full on work mode? Do you think it's possible?
-Any tips on how to get the most out of the time I dedicate to my dissertation? Any tips on dissertation in general?
Thanks!",,,"Hey there! First off, take a deep breath. It sounds like a lot, but it's definitely possible to get through this. Here's a plan you might find helpful:

1. **Prioritize and Plan**: Break down your dissertation into smaller, manageable sections. Set daily word count goals that are realistic but push you a bit. Use a planner or digital tool to map out your tasks for each day leading up to your deadline.

2. **Time Management**: Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain productivity without burning out. This can help you stay focused and make the most of your study sessions.

3. **Limit Distractions**: Create a dedicated workspace and eliminate distractions. This might mean turning off your phone or using apps that block distracting websites.

4. **Leverage Resources**: Since your dissertation is based on existing information, make sure to use all available resources like online databases, libraries, and even reaching out to professors for guidance.

5. **Balance with Finals**: Allocate specific times for dissertation work and finals study. Maybe mornings for writing and afternoons for studying, or whatever works best for your energy levels.

6. **Self-Care**: Don’t forget to take care of yourself. Short breaks, proper meals, and some physical activity can keep your energy levels up.

7. **Stay Positive**: Remember, many have been in your shoes and succeeded. Keep a positive mindset and remind yourself of your goals.

You can definitely switch from procrastination to productivity. It’s all about setting clear goals and sticking to them. Good luck, you’ve got this!","Yes, it's absolutely possible to complete your dissertation in this timeframe, though it will require intense focus and smart time management. The good news is that comparative law research is primarily desk work, so you can make rapid progress once you establish a solid routine.

First, map out exactly what needs to be done. Break down your dissertation into clear sections and set daily word count targets. For a 25K word minimum over ~3 weeks, you're looking at roughly 1.2K words per day. That's very doable if you dedicate focused blocks of time.

For maximum productivity, use the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks. During work blocks, close all distractions and just write. Don't edit as you go - get the words down first, then refine later.

Regarding June finals - you'll need to parallel track these with your dissertation. Set aside 2-3 hours daily for exam prep, ideally during times when your brain isn't at peak performance for writing (like late afternoon). Use active recall methods rather than passive reading to make study time more efficient.

For the last week when work starts, front-load as much dissertation work as possible in the next 2-3 weeks. Plan to use evenings that final week for editing and refinement rather than major writing.

The shift from procrastination to productivity is challenging but doable. Start tomorrow morning - no excuses. The first few days are crucial for building momentum. Set a non-negotiable wake-up time and start working immediately. Track your daily word count to maintain accountability.

Remember: this is a sprint, not a marathon. You can absolutely power through this if you maintain laser focus and stick to a strict schedule. Many students have been in your position and succeeded. You've got this.","You're definitely not alone in this situation, and many students have successfully pulled off a similar feat. Given your deadline, it's crucial to create a very structured plan. First, calculate how many words you need to write per day to meet your goal, considering the 25K to 50K word range. This will give you a daily target. 

Since your dissertation involves reading and gathering information, start by organizing your sources and creating an outline of your chapters. This will help you stay focused on what needs to be covered. Given that you also have finals coming up, allocate specific times of the day or week for studying and stick to it. It might be helpful to wake up a bit earlier each day to get some dissertation work done before diving into your study materials.

To maximize your productivity, consider using the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break of about 15-30 minutes. This technique can help you stay concentrated and avoid burnout.

It's also important to communicate with your new employer about your situation. They might be more understanding than you think, especially if you explain your academic commitments. Perhaps you can negotiate your start date or discuss a flexible schedule for the first few weeks.

Lastly, remind yourself that it's possible to switch from procrastination to productivity. It requires discipline and a willingness to make significant changes to your daily routine. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging your situation and seeking help. Stay committed to your plan, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. Good luck with your dissertation and your upcoming finals!","Okay, deep breaths! It sounds overwhelming, but definitely doable with a solid plan. First, yes, it's possible to go from procrastination to full-on work mode. Many of us have been there! It's about breaking down the mountain into manageable molehills.

For your dissertation, 25-50k words in a month is a lot, but since it's mostly reading and writing, focus on output. I'd suggest setting a daily word count goal. Even if it's just 1000 words a day, that's 30k by the end of the month. Don't aim for perfection in the first draft; just get the ideas down. You can edit later. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to stay on track. Turn off notifications and find a quiet workspace.

Regarding your finals, allocate specific time slots each day for studying. Maybe dissertation in the morning, studying in the afternoon? Prioritize topics based on their weight in the final grade.

The job starting at the end of the month adds another layer, but think of it as a hard deadline. It forces you to be efficient now. Maybe even try to get some dissertation work done *before* the job starts to give yourself a buffer.

My biggest tip for dissertations is to create a detailed outline. Know exactly what each chapter/section will cover. This will make the writing process much smoother. Also, don't be afraid to ask your advisor for help! They've seen this before and can offer valuable guidance. Good luck, you got this!

t3_ukreha,[NEED ADVICE] Procrastination has been taking its toll on me,"I'm just a few months away from graduating high school and I'm having my final exams right now. First exam got over and I feel so guilty for not doing well for one of the easiest paper. If only I studied more and took this seriously I would have got the best marks. But I didn't. 

I have been procrastinating too often since the pandemic. I have almost come to a state where I feel like I don't care even though I wish I cared a lot. I think failing too often made me not care about it anymore. I feel so disgusted at myself for what I have come to. I feel guilty and sad about the way I'm just going to disappoint me and my parents. They have big faith in me which at this point I feel like I am manipulating them. I feel like I would be their biggest disappointment if I go forward this way. My parents don't taunt me anymore by saying do this do that which I wish they still did. 

Idk what I even do with my days. I sleep with big plans for the next day only to end up laying around and scrolling through my phone. I have deactivated my social media accounts except reddit and YouTube as I need them for studying. But YouTube has become my worst enemy in wasting time. I open youtube for study materials and the timeline just forces me to click on videos enough for me to forget about what I was supposed to do. 

I prefer studying in the night than in the morning as I get more instinct at night and feel more lazy in the morning. I wish I could study in the morning as there's more time in the morning. I have tried sleeping and waking up early. But once I have had breakfast I don't wanna do anything anymore. I lose the energy to sit and study. I was a person who hated sleeping other than at night. But nowadays the amount of time I sleep has become worse. I feel tired and lazy most of the time. I have felt that the environment I live in makes me feel suffocated at times and barely any sunlight comes in. I don't go out much either. But it's only for 2 more months and I will be leaving this place so I don't think I can't do anything about that.

 I have all these big plans in my mind that I wish to do but I fail to turn them into actions. I used to work very hard and used to be passionate in the things I do before the pandemic. I actually used to care about things before all this. I just want to get this all over with and move to another place. I just want to set my life straight and get back on track. If I fail to do so It would play a big part in destroying my future and all those big goals I have had my whole life. Please help me get through this somehow.",,,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—recognizing the issue is a big step. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but there are definitely ways to get back on track. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Instead of focusing on big plans, break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make it easier to start and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one.

2. **Create a Study Schedule**: Since you prefer studying at night, try setting a specific time each evening dedicated to studying. Consistency can help build a routine and make it easier to get started.

3. **Limit YouTube Distractions**: Consider using browser extensions that block distracting sites or limit your time on them. You can also try using YouTube only for study-related content by creating a separate account or playlist just for educational videos.

4. **Incorporate Breaks and Movement**: Since you feel tired and lazy, try incorporating short breaks and some physical activity into your day. Even a quick walk outside can boost your energy and mood.

5. **Reflect on Your Motivation**: Remind yourself why you want to achieve your goals. Keeping your long-term aspirations in mind can help reignite your passion and drive.

6. **Reach Out for Support**: Talk to your parents or a trusted friend about how you're feeling. They might offer support or advice that can help you through this period.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks, but taking small steps forward can make a big difference. You've got this!","First off - you haven't ruined everything. The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you still care, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Let's focus on getting through these next two months.

For YouTube, install a browser extension like ""Unhook"" or ""DF Tube"" that removes the recommended videos and homepage feed. This way you can still access study materials without getting sucked into the void. Another option is to download the specific videos you need for studying so you don't have to open YouTube at all.

Since you mention having more energy at night, work with that for now instead of fighting it. But here's the key - set a strict cut-off time for when you'll stop and go to sleep. This helps ensure you're not totally throwing off your schedule.

The morning sluggishness after breakfast is likely because you're staying inactive. Try this: immediately after eating, go for a 10-minute walk, even if it's just around your room. Physical movement helps wake up your body and mind.

For the next two months, break everything down into tiny chunks. Don't think about ""studying for exams"" - think about ""reading one chapter"" or ""solving 5 problems."" Start with just 25 minutes of focused work (use a timer), then take a 5-minute break. Even if you only do one or two of these sessions a day at first, it's better than nothing.

Your parents still believe in you because they've seen what you're capable of. You haven't lost those capabilities - they're just buried under some bad habits that developed during an incredibly disruptive time. Focus on small, consistent actions now, and you can absolutely turn this around.

Remember: You don't need to fix everything at once. Just focus on doing a little better today than yesterday. Start now, start small, but start.","It sounds like you're really struggling with procrastination and feeling stuck, especially with your exams coming up. First, let's acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing the patterns that are holding you back, like mindlessly scrolling through YouTube or sleeping in late. That's a big step.

Given your preference for studying at night, why not try to create a schedule that works with your natural rhythm? Set specific study goals for each evening, and break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. This might help you stay focused and avoid burnout. Also, since you mentioned YouTube is a major distraction, consider using website blockers or apps like Freedom or SelfControl to limit your access to non-study related videos during certain hours.

It's also important to address your energy levels and sleep patterns. While it's tough to change your environment right now, you could try to get some natural light exposure by taking short walks outside during the day or opening your windows to let sunlight in. Additionally, establish a consistent bedtime routine to improve the quality of your sleep.

Remember, getting back on track doesn't have to mean making drastic changes all at once. Start with small, achievable goals, like dedicating 30 minutes each morning to reviewing your notes or making a to-do list for the day. As you build momentum, you can gradually increase your study time and work towards your larger objectives.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about disappointing your parents. They likely want you to succeed and be happy, and it's okay to have setbacks. Instead of focusing on their expectations, try to tap into your own motivations and reasons for wanting to do well. What are your goals and aspirations, and how can you use these exams as a stepping stone to get closer to achieving them? You've got this, and you can get through these next two months with determination and the right strategies in place.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of guilt and disappointment can be a real motivation killer. It sounds like you're stuck in a negative cycle, but the good news is you're aware of it and want to change! That's the first, and often hardest, step.

Since you're close to graduating, let's focus on small, manageable wins. Forget about trying to overhaul everything at once. Instead of aiming for perfect study sessions, try setting a timer for just 25 minutes of focused work (Pomodoro Technique). No distractions, just pure concentration. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Repeat. You might be surprised how much you get done.

About YouTube, try using a browser extension that blocks distracting websites or limits your time on YouTube. You can also create a separate YouTube account just for study materials and only subscribe to relevant channels.

Regarding your sleep schedule, instead of forcing yourself to become a morning person overnight, try shifting your bedtime and wake-up time by just 15 minutes earlier each day. Small changes are easier to stick with. And maybe try a short walk outside first thing in the morning to get some sunlight – even if it's just for 10 minutes. It can really help with energy levels.

Finally, remember that progress isn't linear. You're going to have good days and bad days. Don't beat yourself up over the bad ones. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track the next day. You've got this! You've identified the problem, and you're already thinking about solutions. Just take it one small step at a time. Good luck with your exams!

t3_13lfafr,[Need Advice] How to get into a good routine after work?,"I want to be more productive outside of work. I want to workout, cook, take my dog out, learn a new hobby. 

I’ve been working out inconsistently. I try to take the dog out for a walk when I can. 

My **biggest** challenge is walking early. I feel like I **can not** get myself to wake up early.","You gotta fix your schedule, there's no way around it, even your free time needs to be scheduled. The main tip to wake up early is to sleep early and always the same time, including weekends, in a few days you'll naturally wake up the same hour everyday, the problem is that usually when our system is understanding our new routine we screw up during the weekend.   
Talking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   
In a few days you'll love your new routine and you'll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don't have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there's always a little windows to stick something new you want to try. Be curious, test it, try new things, improvise but always follow your schedule, I like to organize my week during my sunday, this way I know exactly what have to be done in the following days, including when I'll rest.","You might wanna check out Nuj Alarm Clock.

It’s an app I built that charges money if you don’t get up and scan a barcode (e.g. your toothpaste) within a few mins of your alarm.","Creating a routine after work can be a game-changer! Start by setting small, achievable goals. For example, commit to a 10-minute workout or a short walk with your dog right after work. This can help build momentum without feeling overwhelming. As for waking up early, try focusing on your evening routine first. Gradually go to bed earlier and create a relaxing pre-sleep ritual to improve your sleep quality. You might find it easier to wake up earlier once you're well-rested. Also, consider prepping meals or planning your hobby time in advance to make it easier to dive in. Consistency is key, so be patient with yourself as you build these habits. You've got this!","Starting small and building consistency is key here. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick 1-2 habits to focus on first. Since working out and walking your dog are already somewhat in your routine, let's start there.

For the early morning challenge - don't force yourself to become a morning person overnight. Try shifting your bedtime 15 minutes earlier each week. When you do wake up, immediately put on your workout clothes and take your dog for a quick walk. The movement and fresh air will help wake you up naturally.

A solid after-work routine could look like this: Come home, change clothes, 20-minute dog walk, workout for 30 minutes, then cook dinner. The key is doing these activities in the same order every day until they become automatic.

For cooking, try meal prepping on weekends so you have easy healthy options ready during the week. This frees up time for other activities like pursuing a new hobby.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track when you slip up. Start with these basics and gradually add more as these become habits. Even 10 minutes of exercise or a quick walk with your dog is better than nothing. Build from there.

What specific hobby were you thinking about learning? That could be a great reward activity after completing your core routine.","It sounds like you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve outside of work, which is great. To help you establish a consistent routine, let's break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Since waking up early is your biggest challenge, why not start by setting a realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day? This can give you a small window to ease into your morning routine, whether that's a short walk with your dog or some light stretching to get yourself moving. As you get into this habit, you can gradually increase the wake-up time and incorporate other activities like working out or learning your new hobby. It might also be helpful to establish a calming pre-bedtime routine to improve the quality of your sleep, making it easier to wake up in the morning. What do you think is a reasonable wake-up time for you to aim for, and what's one activity you'd like to prioritize in your morning routine?","Hey, I get it, building a routine after work can be tough, especially when you're already tired. It sounds like you've got some good goals though!

For the inconsistent workouts, maybe try scheduling them like appointments in your calendar and treating them as non-negotiable. Even a short 20-minute workout is better than nothing.

Regarding waking up early, that's a common struggle. Instead of drastically changing your wake-up time, try shifting it by just 15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired time. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep! It's easier to wake up early when you're well-rested. Maybe try putting your alarm clock across the room so you HAVE to get out of bed to turn it off.

For the dog walks, could you tie it to something you already do? Like, right after you finish dinner, it's dog walk time. That way, it becomes a habit linked to an existing routine.

Finally, for the new hobby, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Start small – maybe just 15-30 minutes a few times a week. The key is consistency, not perfection. Good luck, you got this!

t3_pd2sr0,[Need Advice] I cannot get started due to my intense procrastination and fear of failure.,"Some background: 
I am currently in my final year of uni and funnily enough, I know nothing about the subject I am studying. That fact alone scares me to death, accompanied by the fact that I have a massive exam coming up in 5 months and I haven’t started preparing. I know what I need to do, how to do it. But I just can't seem to get up and get it done. I get distracted easily and I think it's because I am scared of how much I actually have to do. But I cannot go on like this. 
I know that all I need is to get started. But I just cannot manage that. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I cannot go on like this.",I was diagnosed as a child. But I never received any treatment. I didn’t even know till a few months back when my mother told me that I was diagnosed as a child. It's extremely difficult for me to concentrate. Sitting at a desk or any place for more than half an hour and working is impossible. Is that because of adhd?,"Have you ever looked into ADHD as a possibility? This post and some of your post history sounds deeply familiar to me, and I have diagnosed ADHD (primarily inattentive).","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—recognizing the issue is a big step. Here's a simple approach to get started: break your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about the entire exam, focus on one topic or chapter at a time. Set a timer for 25 minutes (the Pomodoro Technique) and commit to studying just for that period. Afterward, take a 5-minute break. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and make it easier to start. Also, try to create a dedicated study space free from distractions, and maybe use apps like Forest to keep your phone usage in check. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. You've got this!","First off - you're not alone in this situation. Many students find themselves in similar circumstances, even in their final year. The good news is that 5 months is actually a decent amount of time to turn things around.

Here's what you can do right now: Break down your massive exam prep into tiny, less intimidating chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to learn everything,"" start with ""I'll review one basic concept for 25 minutes."" That's it. Don't worry about the next step yet.

Pick the absolute smallest, easiest topic you can think of. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Even if you feel you're doing it badly, just keep going until the timer rings. Then take a 5-minute break. That's one ""Pomodoro"" done. The key is to make the task so small that it would feel ridiculous to not do it.

For the next few days, commit to just two 25-minute sessions per day. No more. This builds momentum without overwhelming yourself. As you get comfortable, gradually increase the number of sessions.

Keep a simple log of your completed sessions. Even if you only do one 25-minute session, write it down. This helps you see that you're making progress, no matter how small.

Remember: The goal isn't to become perfect at studying overnight. The goal is to build a sustainable study habit, starting with absolutely tiny steps. Your future self will thank you for starting today, even if it's just for 25 minutes.","It sounds like you're stuck in a vicious cycle of procrastination and fear, which is totally understandable given the pressure of your final year and upcoming exam. Here's what might help: break down your studying into ridiculously small, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking ""I need to study for my entire subject,"" tell yourself ""I'll review one topic for 25 minutes today."" That's it. Just 25 minutes. You can do that. Once you've done that, take a short break, and then come back to it. The key is to build momentum by getting started, no matter how small the start is. Additionally, consider implementing the Pomodoro Technique to help you stay focused and avoid distractions. It's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to not know everything, and that you can learn and improve over time. You've made it this far in your uni journey, so you've already demonstrated some level of capability. Try to reframe your thinking from ""I'm scared of failing"" to ""I'm taking small steps towards preparing for my exam."" You got this, and taking that first step will be the hardest part - after that, it's just a matter of keeping going.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. That feeling of being overwhelmed can be paralyzing. It sounds like you're stuck in a classic procrastination cycle fueled by fear.

Here's my advice: break it down. Seriously, take that massive exam prep and chop it into tiny, manageable pieces. Instead of thinking ""I have to learn everything,"" think ""Today, I'll spend 30 minutes reviewing chapter 1."" That's it. Just 30 minutes.

Set a timer. When it goes off, you can stop. No guilt. The key is to make the initial hurdle as low as possible. Often, once you get started, you'll find it's not as bad as you thought and you'll keep going.

Also, be kind to yourself. You're in your final year, it's stressful! Don't beat yourself up for not knowing everything. Focus on learning what you can in the time you have. Progress, not perfection, is the goal.

Finally, find an accountability buddy. Someone in your class who's also studying. Check in with each other, quiz each other, just having someone else to share the burden with can make a huge difference. You got this! Just start small.

t3_13nhprw,[Need advice] I need to learn how to control and suppress emotions and feelings,"When I (30s M) have feelings, whether it be love, betrayal, happiness, sadness, etc, I feel it deeply, to the point my emotions affect my thought and decision making processes. My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.","I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.

The advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:

1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)

That's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.

2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.

3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.

Good luck!","Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don't suppress it, it will just bottle up and that's not good. Writing things helps me see it as it is and not with emotions but with logic and rationale.","It sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions, and it's great that you're looking to find a way to manage them better. One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.

Another technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.

Lastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!","Hey there - this is actually a really common challenge that many people face. The goal isn't to completely suppress emotions (they're valuable signals), but rather to create some space between feeling and acting so you can make clearer decisions.

Here's what's helped many others in similar situations:

The ""pause and name"" technique is a good starting point. When you notice strong emotions arising, pause and literally name what you're feeling: ""This is anger"" or ""I'm feeling hopeful right now."" This small act creates a bit of distance and helps engage your rational mind.

For bigger decisions, try the 24-hour rule. When emotions are running high, commit to waiting 24 hours before making any significant choices. Write down your thoughts and feelings, then revisit them the next day when you're calmer. You'll often see things differently.

Regular meditation (even just 5-10 minutes daily) can strengthen your ability to observe emotions without being completely swept away by them. Think of it like building a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger this skill becomes.

Also consider using a decision journal. When facing choices, write down: 1) The situation 2) How you're feeling 3) The logical pros and cons 4) What advice you'd give a friend in the same situation. This helps separate emotional reactions from rational analysis.

Remember, the goal isn't to become an emotionless robot - it's to find a healthy balance where feelings inform but don't override your judgment. Start small, be patient with yourself, and build these practices gradually.","It sounds like you're struggling with impulsivity driven by your emotions, which is a common challenge many people face. One strategy that might help is practicing mindfulness and meditation to increase your self-awareness and ability to recognize when your emotions are taking over. This can help you create a bit of space between your feelings and your decision-making process, allowing you to evaluate situations more logically. Additionally, trying to reframe your thinking by focusing on the facts of a situation rather than how you feel about it can be beneficial. For example, when faced with a decision, try writing down the pros and cons, or talking through your thoughts with a trusted friend or mentor to get an outside perspective. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and remind yourself of them regularly, so when emotions start to cloud your judgment, you can come back to what you know you want to achieve in the long run. Lastly, consider developing a pre-decision routine that gives you time to reflect on your choices, such as waiting 24 hours before making an important decision, to ensure you're acting on logic rather than impulse. Remember, it's not about suppressing your emotions entirely, but learning to navigate them in a way that allows you to make decisions that align with your values and goals.","Hey, I get where you're coming from. It's tough when emotions hijack your decision-making. It sounds like you're really self-aware, which is the first step.

One thing that's helped me is creating a little space between feeling and reacting. When you feel that strong emotion coming on, try to pause. Literally, just stop and take a few deep breaths. It sounds simple, but it can give you a moment to think.

Then, try to label the emotion. Instead of just feeling overwhelmed, say to yourself, ""Okay, I'm feeling anxious right now,"" or ""I'm feeling really angry."" Naming it can help you detach from it a little.

After that, try writing down the pros and cons of the decision you're facing, focusing on the facts and not the feelings. What are the realistic outcomes? What's the worst that could happen? Sometimes seeing it on paper can bring clarity.

Also, consider talking to someone you trust – a friend, family member, or therapist. Just voicing your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see things from a different perspective. You're not alone in this, and it's definitely something you can work on. Good luck!

t3_t1ag4b,[Need Advice] I keep having these extremely low days even though I'm very disciplined most of the time," I'm a 26 years old woman and I'm overall very hard working, high performing and disciplined. I'm working full time while studying to get my second degree, the first one was in english language teaching and the latter one is Computer Science & Engineering. I'm also learning german and I'm a licensed Muay Thai fighter. I've got a very well and balanced diet, I plan my meals carefully and prepare them every morning. I do yoga and clean up my house every morning before showering and going to work and I workout for 1.5 hours every evening, after a light walk no matter how the weather is. At work, during breaks, I try to read books. I don't drink or smoke. My hair and skincare is always on point. Everything is great!

But then, there are some days... About once in every two weeks I just can't bring myself to do anything at all for an entire day! I eat very unhealthily and eat everything I can, I eat onion rings and drink coke even though I don't even like the taste. I don't even brush my teeth or wash my face. I don't leave my bed the whole day and do nothing but watch stuff. Even though I feel absolutely disgusting and dumb on those days, even though I get bored of what I'm watching after just an hour and sick of eating disgustingly unhealthy stuff after a single bite, I just keep doing that. Even though doing so ruins my day and the day after that. Even if I can make an exciting plan for that entire day and do everything -I'm single, young pretty and I earn well, I just choose to do this and regret it after 10 minutes but still keep doing this. I don't know what's the problem with me or how I can solve this. Is anybody else like this? Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.","Sounds like you're not giving yourself enough rest throughout the week so that it comes a point where your body just has had enough and forces you to take a break. You could try to give yourself more chances to rest, maybe just lie there every now and then, take a walk, just let your brain not intake any external stimuli for a while and see if things get any better. Sometimes we get so busy with what we ""should"" do that we forget to pay attention to what is going on within us.",The problem is that I feel extremely disgusting on those days and even the day after.,"It sounds like you're doing an incredible job balancing a lot of responsibilities and maintaining a disciplined lifestyle. It's completely normal to have off days, especially when you're juggling so much. These low days might be your body's way of telling you to take a break. Instead of seeing them as failures, try to view them as necessary rest days. Everyone needs downtime to recharge, and it’s okay to indulge occasionally. You might find it helpful to schedule regular breaks or lighter days into your routine to prevent burnout. Also, consider exploring why you feel the need to push through these days despite feeling off. Sometimes, just acknowledging that it's okay to rest can make a big difference. Keep up the great work, and remember that balance includes rest too!","What you're describing sounds like a natural response to an incredibly demanding schedule. Those ""low days"" aren't a sign that something's wrong with you - they're your mind and body's way of forcing a break when you've been pushing hard for too long.

Instead of viewing these days as failures, try reframing them as recovery periods. Just like how athletes need rest days to perform at their peak, high-achievers need mental recovery time. The key is to make these breaks more intentional and less destructive.

Here's what you might try: Schedule one ""free day"" every two weeks where you deliberately ease up on your usual strict routine. But instead of falling into the all-or-nothing pattern, set some basic minimum standards - maybe just 3 non-negotiables like brushing teeth, a 10-minute walk, and one healthy meal. This way you get the psychological relief of a ""day off"" without the guilt and physical discomfort afterward.

You could also experiment with building more small breaks into your regular schedule. Maybe that means one evening per week where you deliberately take it easier, or building in some flexibility around your usual routines. This might help prevent the buildup that leads to those crash days.

Remember - sustainability beats intensity. It's better to maintain 80% effort consistently than to swing between 100% and 0%. You're already achieving an incredible amount - now it's about finding that sweet spot where you can maintain it long-term.","It sounds like you're experiencing a phenomenon known as ""discipline fatigue"" or ""self-regulation depletion,"" where your usual high level of discipline and self-control gets exhausted, leading to these low days. This can happen when you're consistently pushing yourself to maintain a very high standard across multiple areas of your life. It's not uncommon for people who are highly disciplined to have days like this, as it's almost like your brain is rebelling against the constant pressure to perform.

One strategy that might help is to build in some intentional ""rest days"" or ""relaxation days"" into your schedule, where you give yourself permission to take a break from your usual routine and just do whatever feels easy and enjoyable. This could be as simple as taking a Sunday morning off from yoga and cleaning, or dedicating one evening a week to watching your favorite TV show without feeling guilty.

Another approach might be to try to identify what triggers these low days - is it stress at work, feeling overwhelmed with school, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of what's driving these episodes, you can start working on ways to mitigate those factors. For example, if you find that you're more likely to have a low day after a particularly tough week at work, you could try building in some extra self-care activities on Fridays to help you unwind.

It's also worth considering the idea that these low days might not be entirely negative - sometimes our brains just need a break from the constant pressure to perform, and allowing ourselves to indulge in some guilty pleasures can actually be a form of self-care. The key is to find a balance between giving yourself permission to relax and not letting those relaxation days turn into regret-filled binges.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to not be perfect all the time - it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to maintain this incredibly high level of discipline and productivity, and that can be exhausting. Try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's normal to have off days, and that you can always get back on track tomorrow.","Hey, it sounds like you're crushing it most of the time, which is awesome! Don't beat yourself up too much about those off days. It's pretty common, even for disciplined people, to have occasional ""reset"" days.

Instead of viewing them as failures, maybe try reframing them as a necessary part of your routine. Think of it like a scheduled maintenance day for your mental and emotional well-being.

A couple of things you could try: First, experiment with scheduling these days in advance. If you know roughly when they're coming, you can plan for them. Maybe even make a ""lazy day kit"" with healthier snacks, a good book, and a comfy blanket. That way, you're still taking a break, but in a slightly more mindful way.

Second, explore what triggers these days. Is it stress from work, studying, or something else? Identifying the cause can help you address the underlying issue and potentially reduce the frequency of these days. Maybe incorporate more relaxation techniques into your regular routine, like meditation or spending time in nature.

Finally, remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Don't let these occasional days derail your overall momentum. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track the next day. You've got this!

Here's what helped me build consistency with tough classes: Break everything into small, manageable chunks. Don't think about the whole semester - just focus on what you need to do today. Make a study schedule that includes short breaks (like 25 minutes of work, 5 minute break). This makes things feel less overwhelming.

For math and biology specifically, try to study a little bit every day rather than cramming. Use resources like Khan Academy or your school's tutoring services from the start - don't wait until you're struggling. Getting help early is a sign of strength, not weakness.

When things get tough, remind yourself why you're doing this. Write down your goals and keep them visible. Remember that temporary discomfort is part of growth - if you stick with it, you'll be amazed at how much you can learn and improve.

Start building good habits now: organize your materials, set up a dedicated study space, and plan specific times for coursework. The first few weeks are crucial for setting the tone.

If this goes on, it will be very likely that I will be sleepy during my exam. 

For background, I've been sleeping irregularly for 5-8 hours a day. The timing differs everyday but usually I sleep at around 1-2 am at night, amd wake up at 6 am. After that I nap again when I feel tired which is usually around 10 am. I've been getting very inadequate amount of sleep and i'm concerned it will take a toll on my performance.

 Thanks in advance.",,,"Hey there! Fixing your sleep schedule in a week is definitely doable with some discipline and consistency. Here’s a plan you might find helpful:

1. **Set a consistent bedtime and wake-up time**: Aim to go to bed around 10-11 pm and wake up at 6-7 am. This gives you a solid 7-8 hours of sleep, which is ideal. Stick to these times even on weekends to help your body adjust.

2. **Gradually adjust your schedule**: If you’re used to sleeping at 1-2 am, try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach your target bedtime. This gradual shift can make the transition smoother.

3. **Create a bedtime routine**: Wind down with relaxing activities like reading or taking a warm bath. Avoid screens at least an hour before bed as the blue light can interfere with your sleep.

4. **Limit naps**: Try to avoid napping, especially around 10 am. If you must nap, keep it short (20-30 minutes) and do it earlier in the day.

5. **Morning exposure to natural light**: Get outside in the morning for some sunlight exposure. This helps regulate your body’s internal clock and can make you feel more alert.

6. **Watch your caffeine intake**: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening as it can disrupt your sleep.

7. **Stay active**: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. Just try not to exercise too close to bedtime.

Remember, consistency is key. It might be tough at first, but stick with it, and you’ll likely see improvements by the time your exam rolls around. Good luck!","Here's what you need to do to reset your sleep schedule and be alert for your exam. Start tonight by setting a firm bedtime of 10pm - this gives you 8 solid hours before waking at 6am. The key is to stick to this schedule consistently for the next week, even on weekends.

To make this work, stop taking those 10am naps completely starting now. They're disrupting your natural sleep cycle. Instead, when you feel tired during the day, try going for a short walk, drinking water, or doing some light stretching.

Some practical tips to help you adjust:
Start dimming lights and avoiding screens 1-2 hours before your new bedtime. If you must use devices, use blue light filters. Get some exposure to natural sunlight first thing after waking up - this helps regulate your body clock. Exercise during the day, but not within 3 hours of bedtime. Cut out caffeine after 2pm.

The first 2-3 days will be tough as your body adjusts, but stick with it. If you absolutely can't fall asleep at 10pm initially, still wake up at 6am no matter what. You'll be tired enough the next night to fall asleep earlier.

Remember, one week is enough time to adjust your sleep schedule if you're consistent. The key is to power through those first few days without giving in to naps or sleeping in. Good luck on your exam - you've got this!","To fix your sleep schedule in just a week, you'll need to make some significant adjustments, but it's doable with a solid plan.

Given your exam is at 10 am, try going to bed between 10-11 pm and waking up around 6-7 am. This will give you 7-8 hours of sleep, which should help improve the quality of your rest.

It's also crucial to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches - avoid screens for at least an hour before bed. During the day, try to get some morning sunlight exposure to help regulate your circadian rhythms, and avoid napping close to your desired wake-up time.

To tackle your 10 am sleepiness, try getting some fresh air and natural light around that time, and engage in a short, intense activity - like a brisk walk or a few jumping jacks - to increase your alertness. You can also use the ""2-day rule"" to adjust your body: for the next two days, try to stay awake until 10 am without napping, and then allow yourself a 20-minute power nap if needed. This will help your body adjust to being more alert at that time.

Lastly, be mindful of your caffeine intake - while it might seem like a quick fix, consuming too much caffeine close to your exam time can lead to jitters and decreased focus. Try to limit your caffeine consumption to earlier in the day, and opt for water or herbal tea closer to your exam time. With consistent effort, you should be able to adjust your sleep schedule and feel more alert and focused by the time your exam rolls around. Good luck!","Okay, so you've got a week to get your sleep sorted before the exam. That's doable, but you need to be consistent. Here's a plan:

First, **start shifting your bedtime and wake-up time *gradually***. Don't try to flip your schedule overnight. Aim to go to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night and wake up 15-30 minutes earlier each morning. This will be much easier on your body clock.

Second, **nail down a consistent wake-up time**. Even on the weekend (if you have one before the exam), get up at the same time. This is key to resetting your circadian rhythm. Force yourself out of bed, even if you're tired.

Third, **ditch the naps, especially around 10 am**. I know it's tempting, but those naps are messing with your sleep drive. If you absolutely *must* nap, keep it short (20-30 minutes max) and before 2 pm.

Fourth, **optimize your sleep environment**. Make sure your room is dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine.

Fifth, **establish a relaxing bedtime routine**. This could include reading a book (not on a screen!), taking a warm bath, or doing some light stretching. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.

Sixth, **expose yourself to bright light in the morning**. This helps to suppress melatonin and signal to your body that it's time to be awake. Open the curtains, go for a walk outside, or use a light therapy lamp.

Finally, and this is important, **simulate exam conditions**. A few days before the exam, wake up at your target time, and do some practice questions at 10 am. This will help your body and mind adjust to being alert and focused at that time.

It's going to be tough for the first few days, but stick with it. Consistency is key. Good luck with your exam!

t3_sszuix,[Need Advice] Taking a break while gaining momentum,"Hi there. By some miracle, and with a help of Pomodoro, I've managed to put 7 hours of studying into my daily routine which had seemed impossible a month ago. For almost 3 weeks now I've been doing these 7-hour sessions every day and I am proud of it but there is a challenge that appeared that i didn't expect. I'm scared of taking off days. It feels like I've gained momentum and can easily lose it and come back to my old ways if stopped. This is purely psychological but it does feel like fear. I'm generally a pretty slow and lazy person so these last 3 weeks are somewhat exceptional for my life. It all sounds stupid but it would be nice to read some suggestions thank you",,,"Taking breaks is actually a crucial part of maintaining long-term productivity and discipline. It’s awesome that you’ve built up this momentum, but remember that rest is part of the process too. Think of it like a muscle; you need to let it recover to grow stronger. Try scheduling a regular rest day, maybe once a week, and see it as a reward for your hard work. You can use that time to recharge and reflect on what you’ve accomplished. It might feel counterintuitive, but taking a break can actually help you maintain your momentum in the long run. Keep up the great work, and don’t be too hard on yourself!","First off - congrats on building such an impressive study routine! Going from zero to 7 hours daily is a massive achievement. Your concern about losing momentum is actually really common among people who've successfully built new habits.

Here's the thing though - rest days are crucial for sustainable progress. Think of it like working out - even professional athletes need recovery days to prevent burnout and injury. The same applies to intense mental work.

The key is to plan your breaks strategically. Instead of taking random days off when you feel tired (which can lead to guilt and breaking the habit), schedule specific rest days in advance. Maybe make Sunday your designated ""recharge day."" This way, it becomes part of your routine rather than a disruption to it.

You could also use a modified schedule on rest days - like doing 2-3 hours of light review instead of the full 7 hours. This maintains the habit while giving your brain the break it needs.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect every single day - it's about consistency over time. You've already proven to yourself that you can do this for 3 weeks straight. That ability doesn't disappear after one rest day. The habit is more resilient than you think.

Take those breaks. Your study sessions will actually be more productive when you're properly rested and recharged.","It's great that you've been able to establish a consistent study routine, and it's understandable that you're worried about losing momentum. One thing to consider is that taking breaks can actually help you maintain your progress in the long run. Instead of thinking of days off as a threat to your momentum, try to view them as a necessary part of your overall routine. You could designate one or two days a week as ""rest days"" where you don't study at all, or scale back your study sessions to something much shorter, like 30 minutes. This can help you recharge and come back to your studies feeling refreshed. It might also be helpful to reflect on what specifically is driving your fear of taking breaks - is it the worry that you'll fall behind, or something else? Identifying the root of your concern might make it easier to address. Additionally, you could try setting small goals for yourself during your days off, like reading a book or taking a walk, to help you feel like you're still being productive even when you're not studying. Remember that consistency is key, but so is sustainability - it's better to aim for a pace that you can maintain over time rather than burning out by trying to study 7 hours a day every single day.","Hey, congrats on the amazing progress! 7 hours a day for 3 weeks is seriously impressive, especially if it's a big change from your norm.

It's totally understandable to feel that fear of losing momentum. Here's a thought: instead of a complete ""off"" day, maybe try a ""light"" day. Reduce your study time to, say, 2-3 hours. That way, you're still keeping the habit alive, but giving yourself a mental break. Think of it like active recovery in exercise.

Also, maybe plan something really enjoyable for your ""light"" day. That way, you're associating taking a break with something positive, rather than just feeling like you're slacking off. You've earned it! Good luck!

t3_uxzgse,[need advice] how do i get myself to do anything when I'm stressed out?,I literally can do nothing but scrolling reddit or something like that when I'm stressed. I also have problems with procrastination. What should I do? I'm ruining my education.,,"Hi, I assume that everyone has their own way to release their stresses. In my case, I was also scrolling reddit (before, I was drinking and smoking! But this scrolling reddit is already better version of mine). 
I do not see any problem of releasing stress in this way (reddit), but still struggled about controlling my emotion.
My next trial is learning meditation, which starts during Jubilee next week. 
What about learning something like this? Like, yoga, meditation, etc

Btw, you are not ruining. I was there as well and this is a part of life journey. You thinking about being better is already big movement and wish you can achieve what you aimed for soon!","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, but don't worry—there are ways to tackle this. When stress hits, it's easy to fall into the trap of mindless scrolling. One thing that might help is setting small, manageable goals for yourself. Start with something super simple, like studying for just 10 minutes. Once you get going, you might find it easier to keep going. Also, try to identify what specifically is stressing you out and see if you can address it directly. Sometimes breaking down a big task into smaller parts can make it feel less overwhelming. Lastly, consider setting specific times for breaks and leisure activities, so you can enjoy them guilt-free. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. You've got this!","Stress-scrolling is a really common trap - your brain is seeking quick relief through easy dopamine hits. The key is breaking this cycle with small, manageable steps.

Start by setting a 5-minute timer when you notice yourself stress-scrolling. When it goes off, get up and do one tiny productive thing - even just organizing one corner of your desk or writing down one homework question. This helps interrupt the scroll-spiral while feeling achievable when you're stressed.

For the procrastination piece, try the ""5-minute rule"" - commit to working on something for just 5 minutes. Often you'll find yourself naturally wanting to continue once you've started. If not, that's fine - you still made progress.

Another practical tip: put your phone in another room while studying and use website blockers during designated work periods. Making it slightly harder to access Reddit/social media creates a pause that can help you catch yourself.

Remember that building new habits takes time. Don't beat yourself up if you slip sometimes. Focus on gradually increasing your productive periods and finding healthy stress outlets (quick walk, stretching, deep breaths) that can replace scrolling.

What specific subject or assignment feels most urgent right now? We can brainstorm some concrete steps to tackle it in small chunks.","When you're feeling stressed, it's really tough to motivate yourself to do anything productive. One strategy that might help is to start small - instead of trying to tackle a big task or project, break it down into tiny, manageable chunks. Like, if you've got a paper to write, start by just opening up your notes or research, or writing a single sentence. Often, getting started is the hardest part, and once you've made a little progress, you can build momentum. It might also be helpful to set a timer for, say, 10 or 15 minutes, and challenge yourself to focus on your task during that time. When the timer goes off, take a short break - scroll Reddit if you need to! - and then come back to your task. As for procrastination, it's a common problem, especially when you're stressed. You might consider talking to a counselor or academic advisor at your school for support - they can help you develop strategies to stay on top of your work and manage your stress. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about making progress, and taking care of yourself in the process.","Hey, I totally get that feeling. Stress and procrastination can be a killer combo. Here's a thought: instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, try starting super small. When you feel stressed, instead of immediately reaching for Reddit, tell yourself you'll just work on one tiny task for literally 5 minutes. Like, read one page of a textbook, or write one sentence of an assignment. Set a timer. Usually, once you get started, it's easier to keep going. And if you really can't after 5 minutes, at least you did *something*. Also, maybe try to identify what's stressing you out specifically. If you can break down the problem, it might feel less overwhelming. Good luck, you got this!

t3_13ae213,[NEED ADVICE] I feel like im not even living anymore due to my addictions I’m trapped I’m going I’m circles I die of boredom please help me please read,"I’m not sure what to do. I’m at a loss. I do not know how to start. I have idea and I am ambitious I can feel it. I’ve gotten so lazy even though I work 6 days a week im usually always on my phone. My job is easy. I don’t even know how im still hired there. I’m so addicted to food. I’m so consumed by my phone. I’ve gotten so lazy I just do the minimum. I take 1-2 classes a quarter. I workout and eat just good enough to maintain the hard work and fitness I have worked for over the years. I make sure I am hygienic and clean. I have no motivation to do more than the minimum. I barely holding on. Procrastinating everything. I just can’t believe I spend a majority of my day staring at this fucking phone an average of 6-8 hours screen time. SIX TO EIGHT HOURS SCREEN TIME EVERYDAY . Like im zoned in and unaware of the real world. I take medication for adhd 5 days a week. Im a mess. I am trying to read more books and learn more. I just don’t know how to do this.


I have this notebook. I am writing down all my goals and bullet points on how I can achieve those goals then everyday I wanna write down my plans /to do list for the day. I also wanna use this to journal rather than use my notes app. I will still use my notes app but not as much.
I know I need to first fix my sleep. I THINK I can do that since I can look forward to sleep if im actually tired. So I think I can get that down. I know 2nd I need to reduce my
Screen time. I will do this by setting screen time restrictions on my
Phone and putting my phone far away when going to sleep. I also need to have a set food schedule. I need to  stop buying junk food for now. If someone offers a cookie, sure. But I will not willingly buy anymore junk food regularly. And I will write down what I eat and what I plan to eat. I will write out my whole plan for the day 

Now everything In between is what will make me fail. It’s the boredom and lack of motivation. Don’t give me that “it’s discipline not motivation” yeah well no shit. Why do u think depressed people are less ambitious than mentally healthy people? You can’t just say “suck it up” to everyone because it DOESNT WORK…. you think I haven’t tried to suck it up? 

What I’m asking for is brain hacks. Ways to stay on track. Ways to get shit done. How to deal with the boredom . How to stay consistent. How to stop failing. How to resist my phone. How to deal with the boredom long enough so that discipline becomes fun and easy. How to not feel excruciating boredom when I am not on TikTok or Netflix or Hulu or YouTube.  How to stop thinking of food when I am legitimately addicted to food and can’t stop thinking of it.  I wanna start now but I feel stuck. I can’t explain it I feel trapped . I feel trapped. I’m trapped. I stay stuck with these addictions and not changing, this I stay trapped. If I try to get disciplined I go crazy from boredom and anger and I hate my life because I don’t wanna fucking do the task and when I start the fucking task I take forever because my phone distracts me or I take long because the task is so boring it’s so boring boring boring  I know it will get better but for now how do I deal with this boredom?!!

PLEASE IM BEGGING U HELP ME","Disclaimer: none of this may be helpful, but I’ll give you what has worked for me at different points in my life. I’m just jotting down thoughts as they come so this might not be very organized, but the lessons/ ideas should still come thru. If you find this helpful and want me to clarify or add more things I’ve tried just reply back

I think brain hacks can help, but it seems like different ones will work at different times of your life and work for some and don’t work for others.

I have had varying degrees of laziness and problems with motivation throughout my life.

I’ve gone through periods where I’ve had nothing going on, playing video games all day and not even being able to have a sleeping routine. I tried so many ways during this period to be more productive and get out of the rut, but was unsuccessful. During this period I realized that I only was able to do things out of necessity. I had to have some kind of commitment that I was locked into and had to work towards. Like having a job that you force yourself to show up for because you don’t want to let people down and need the money. After learning this I went to the extreme and locked myself into a contract with the Air Force. I knew that once in I wouldn’t be able to just quit and I’d be forced to take action because there wasn’t another choice. My point is, you don’t need to join the military, but if you can find commitments in your life that would force you to take action maybe this could be a step in the right direction and possible solution to force yourself out of a rut.

At other points in my life the power of positive thinking helped. I read countless books over the course of years before I actually understood exactly what this meant. Anytime you look up how to get motivated or disciplined or whatever you get the same answers. Mindfulness, gratitude, positive thinking. I was always left thinking this is some blanket statement thrown out that didn’t actually mean anything and certainly didn’t help. Maybe there’s some truth to that, but regardless here’s what I learned worked for me in this realm. To me, It’s the process of changing your identity and reinforcing it. If you tell yourself and believe that you’re in shape or an athlete, it’s much easier to talk yourself into regular exercise because you believe the act of exercise is to the core of who you are. So anytime you are about to do something productive start by saying I am this, and then reinforce it with the actual act. Before you workout tell yourself I am an athlete and then reinforce it to yourself by exercising even if it’s for 10 min. Another example, tell yourself you a disciplined person and then read 10 pages of a book. Tell yourself you are mentally strong and then take a 2 min cold shower. It might sound crazy, but I’ve really noticed a difference after just a few weeks of doing this. You don’t need to do a half hour meditation routine everyday to reap the benefits of positive self talk.

On this topic, at one point of my life I was so miserable that all of my thoughts were negative. I would hold onto any failure or things I didn’t accomplish and beat myself up for it. This process of constantly thinking about the negative made me feel so much worst. I found out how much it was affecting me because one day on my way home from work I finally snapped and silenced my mind. Anytime I had a negative thought I would just shut it out. I would literally tell myself to shut up. I felt better immediately. Since then I’ve made a rule to just never think negative thoughts, I just have never found a time when they’ve been useful.

While constantly researching and trying things to change my discipline my process would usually go like this. I would learn one thing, try it, maybe it helped a bit. I’d forget about it look up some new technique, maybe it worked, forget about it. Rinse, repeat. I’ve learned that being organized and having things written down and having reminders helps to stay consistent. 

What helps me to do this is to always be running a 30 day challenge. I print out a habit tracker every month with a box for each action on each day to check off. I hold myself accountable by doing this with my partner and it has become a rivalry between us. We put conditions for the challenge where if one of us doesn’t check all the boxes in a day we have to do the punishment of the others choosing. For me if I don’t do my list I have to watch a marvel movie (which I hate) funny enough this has been a huge deterrent from me not completing my list. Not because the movie would be such a bad thing, but more out of stubbornness to not give my partner the satisfaction lol. One more thing to add I. This is to include things on your challenge that are obtainable and work yourself up each month. Discipline is like a muscle you have to work out to get continually stronger. You can’t go from being completely undisciplined one day to having completely disciplined the next. You have to work yourself up to it. Make sure to include things on the challenge like positive reinforcements before each task.

One of my items on my list is to create a “time box” for each day. This is a daily timed planner that outlines what I need to do for the day and at what time I need to accomplish it by. Keeps me organized and not save everything for the later part of the day so I don’t have to do everything at one time.

Finally give yourself some grace. It’s not easy to do these things, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Just remember that you are not alone, most people deal with the same things. Perspective is key, change the way you see things. Don’t say things like I have to go to work say I get to go to work, at least you have a job. Instead of saying I have to drive my busted up car say I get to drive my car, at least you have one, many people don’t. Chances are you are probably in a better spot than you think in comparison to how things could be. Be grateful for who you are and what you have. You could be sick and not able to do anything. I saw a video the other day that had someone asking if I offered to give you 10 million dollars would you take it. Everyone of course said yes. He then said okay I could give you this 10 million dollars, but you’ll only live for another week. Everyone then changed their mind. It stuck with me. I’m grateful to be healthy and though the money would be nice I’m happy to be healthy.","Thank you. I am trying one day at a time. The food thing is very hard as well as the phone. I’ve improved in some aspects, we pray 5x a day in our religion and I became a looot more consistent with that, I quit alcohol and drug phase from high school, more consistency with school, the medication helped me reduce my binge eating so I don’t feel as depressed and lost weight. 

I just feel like when some things are good, there are still a million things that are bad. Like sure I improved in these areas, but then I’m addressed with so much more responsibility and possibly getting married , and dealing with family and stress and I look around seeing an unorganized room when i know I have time to clean I’m just lazy.  Procrastinating important things. It scares me for the future especially for marriage. 

I appreciate your time to post this. I think food and screen time are my biggest weaknesses for now. Too much entertainment makes  the rest of life so dull. I will try to reduce carbs possibly try keto again and try to find other things to do aside from this stupid addictive phone.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make changes. It sounds like you're already on the right track with some solid ideas, like using a notebook for goals and setting screen time limits. Here are a few more tips that might help:

1. **Start Small**: It’s tempting to overhaul everything at once, but that can be overwhelming. Pick one habit to focus on first, like reducing screen time or improving sleep, and build from there.

2. **Pomodoro Technique**: This can be a game-changer for dealing with boredom and procrastination. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It can make tasks feel less daunting and help you stay focused.

3. **Find Alternatives**: Replace phone time with something engaging but less addictive. Try podcasts, audiobooks, or even a new hobby that doesn’t involve screens.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a big focus, try to eat mindfully. Pay attention to your meals without distractions, which can help reduce cravings and make eating more satisfying.

5. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community where you can check in regularly. Sometimes knowing someone else is rooting for you can boost motivation.

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and reward yourself for small achievements. It can be as simple as enjoying a favorite snack or taking a relaxing bath.

Remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You’ve got this!","Hey there - I really get the struggle with phone addiction and boredom. Let me share some practical ""brain hacks"" that can help you break free from this cycle.

First, for the phone addiction: Install an app like Forest that gamifies staying off your phone. When you want to focus, you plant a virtual tree that grows while you don't touch your phone - if you break focus, the tree dies. It sounds simple, but it taps into our brain's reward systems in a positive way. Start with just 25 minute growing sessions.

For dealing with the crushing boredom: Your brain is currently wired to expect constant stimulation from social media. You need to gradually rewire it. Start with very short periods away from your phone - even just 5-10 minutes. During these breaks, do something physical that engages your senses - take a walk, do some stretches, or even just make tea mindfully. The key is to make it through those initial uncomfortable moments.

About the food addiction: Keep a ""craving journal"" where you note the time, intensity, and what triggered each craving. This helps separate the physical hunger from emotional eating. When cravings hit, try the ""urge surfing"" technique - observe the craving like a wave that will eventually pass instead of fighting it.

For getting tasks done: Use the ""5-minute rule."" Tell yourself you only have to work on something for 5 minutes. Usually, once you start, you'll naturally want to continue. If not, that's fine - you still made progress. The key is making the initial barrier tiny.

These aren't instant fixes, but they're proven techniques that work with your brain's natural patterns instead of against them. Start implementing just one of these today - maybe the Forest app or the 5-minute rule. Small wins build momentum.

Remember: You're not trapped - you're in transition. Every time you resist an urge or focus for even a few minutes, you're literally rewiring your brain's reward pathways. It gets easier with practice.","I can feel your desperation and frustration, and I'm here to offer some suggestions that might help. First, it's great that you've identified the areas you want to improve, such as reducing screen time, fixing your sleep, and developing a healthier relationship with food. Those are all excellent starting points. 

One strategy that might help you deal with boredom is to start small and make your tasks more manageable. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, break down your goals into tiny, almost ridiculously easy tasks. For example, if you want to start reading more, commit to reading for just 5-10 minutes a day. If you want to work on a project, start by dedicating 15-20 minutes to it each day. This can help build momentum and make the task less overwhelming.

Another approach is to find ways to make your tasks more engaging. If you're bored with a particular activity, try to find a way to make it more interesting. For example, if you're trying to learn something new, watch videos or listen to podcasts on the topic instead of just reading about it. If you're working on a project, try to find a way to make it more creative or challenging.

To resist the temptation of your phone, you might consider implementing some physical barriers, such as putting your phone in a different room or using a website blocker. You could also try replacing your phone time with other activities that bring you joy, such as drawing, journaling, or taking a walk.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel bored sometimes, and it doesn't mean you're failing. It's normal for our brains to wander and get distracted, especially when we're trying to develop new habits. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge the feeling and gently bring your focus back to the task at hand.

Lastly, consider seeking out accountability and support from friends, family, or a therapist. Having someone to talk to and share your struggles with can make a big difference in staying motivated and on track.

Remember, developing discipline and breaking addictions is a process that takes time, patience, and kindness towards yourself. You're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you. Keep moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.","Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out and already planning some changes is a huge first step. You're not alone in this struggle.

First off, that notebook idea is solid. Writing things down makes them real. Start small with your daily plans – maybe just 2-3 key tasks. Don't overwhelm yourself.

About the boredom... you're right, just ""sucking it up"" doesn't work. You need to actively replace the addictive stuff with something else. Since you're already working out, maybe try timing your workouts and trying to beat your personal best. Gamify it. Or, since you're reading more, try finding books that are super engaging, like thrillers or mysteries, to really pull you in. Audiobooks can also be great for when you're doing chores or walking.

For the phone addiction, the screen time restrictions are good, but also think about *why* you're reaching for it. Is it boredom? Loneliness? Stress? If you can identify the trigger, you can find a healthier coping mechanism. Maybe it's a quick walk, a few minutes of meditation, or calling a friend.

Food is tough. You're on the right track with cutting out the junk food. Instead of focusing on what you *can't* have, focus on what you *can* have. Explore new healthy recipes. Make cooking an activity. And don't beat yourself up if you slip up – just get back on track with the next meal.

As for staying consistent, try the ""two-minute rule."" If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. It's a small win that can build momentum. Also, celebrate your small victories. Did you resist the urge to check your phone for an hour? Awesome! Acknowledge it.

Finally, remember that discipline isn't about being perfect; it's about progress. You're going to have bad days. The key is to not let those bad days derail you completely. Just keep showing up and trying your best. You got this.

t3_y3ddnb,[Need Advice] Tips on developing thicker skin for criticism?,"I’m an incredibly thin-skinned person when it comes to any sort of criticism. The second I hear any kind of criticism from a parent, professor, friend, or acquaintance, I feel incredibly deflated and my entire day is ruined. I think part of this comes from wanting to be liked by people and hating that people see something in me worth criticizing. But I want to change. Any advice on developing a more resilient attitude to criticism?","You need to grow your self confidence.

In my case. I studied some philosophy.

Also, you need to be smart to take this criticism like a good sign. Cuz if they have some critics about you, actually you need to think why are they doing this?

If you feel like you are doing things ok and you know who you are and have a clear goal and objectives that are aligned with your perspective of life, moral and ethics. 

Then there is a big chance that they only are making criticism about themselves. Cuz are ppl out there that doesn't have a little of confidence to achieve that you are achieving. Or actually envy your actual position or anything that you are doing. 

You need to be able to identify which critics actually are good for you. Be humble, and accept the critics that can be an improvement for you. Be smart, think about this critics like only information that comes to you. You decide to use it in the way you need. Don't waste good information but if the info comes with hate or trash words, just don't waste your time arguing or being mad, don't auto sabotage your mind.

In all of the cases that I mentioned critics are so good because if ppl are talking shit or want to demotivate you. It is sign that you are doing things ok. If they are good, the critics are constructive cuz they want you to be better. But in the other hand if they are bad, the critics are trash cuz they envy you and don't want you to success. 

But always listen, and take advantage of information.

Most of ppl actually don't want others to grow and have success in life cuz in that way they feel less bad.

Keep going.",Write down all the things you think are worth criticizing. Since a lot of things are open to improving and most things are subjective … that’s pretty much everything. Don’t take yourself so seriously.,"One way to develop a thicker skin is to reframe how you view criticism. Instead of seeing it as a personal attack, try to see it as an opportunity for growth. When someone criticizes you, ask yourself if there's any truth to what they're saying and how you can use it to improve. It might help to remind yourself that everyone has room for improvement and that criticism is a part of learning and growing. Also, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of being human. Over time, this mindset shift can help you become more resilient to criticism. Lastly, consider setting small goals to expose yourself to constructive feedback regularly, like asking a trusted friend for their honest opinion on something specific. This can help you gradually build up your tolerance and learn to handle criticism more effectively.","Learning to handle criticism better is a skill that can definitely be developed with practice. One effective approach is to start viewing criticism as valuable feedback for growth rather than a personal attack. When someone offers criticism, try to pause and ask yourself ""What can I learn from this?"" instead of immediately feeling defensive.

A practical exercise you can try: The next time you receive criticism, write it down word-for-word and wait 24 hours before reflecting on it. This cooling-off period helps separate the emotional reaction from the actual content of the feedback. You'll often find that what felt devastating in the moment looks much more manageable the next day.

It's also worth remembering that receiving criticism usually means you're putting yourself out there and trying things - that's something to be proud of. Even the most successful people face regular criticism. The difference is they've learned to filter it: take what's useful, discard what isn't, and keep moving forward.

Start small. Maybe practice with minor critiques from people you trust, and gradually work your way up to handling tougher feedback. Over time, you'll build that mental muscle of resilience, just like any other skill.

Remember: someone taking the time to give you feedback often means they see potential in you and want to help you improve. That's actually a compliment in disguise.","Developing thicker skin to criticism is definitely achievable with practice and the right mindset. One strategy you could try is to separate your self-worth from the criticism itself - remember that just because someone criticizes one aspect of your work or behavior, it doesn't define your entire worth as a person. It might also help to reframe criticism as an opportunity for growth and improvement, rather than as a personal attack. When you receive criticism, try to focus on the specific issue being addressed and what you can learn from it, rather than taking it as a reflection of your overall character. Additionally, consider seeking out constructive feedback from people you trust, which can help you build resilience and develop a more nuanced understanding of how to use criticism to your advantage. It's also important to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone receives criticism at some point - it's how you respond to it that matters. By gradually exposing yourself to constructive criticism and working on your self-perception, you can build up your resilience over time and develop a more confident attitude towards feedback.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Criticism stings! One thing that's helped me is to try and reframe how I see it. Instead of viewing criticism as a personal attack, try to see it as data. Is there something useful in what they're saying, even if the delivery isn't perfect?

Another thing is to actively seek feedback in small doses. Ask a friend or professor for specific feedback on a project or presentation. This helps you get used to hearing critiques and allows you to practice responding constructively.

Also, remember that not all criticism is valid. Sometimes people are projecting their own insecurities or just having a bad day. Learn to discern between constructive criticism and just plain negativity. If it's not helpful or accurate, let it roll off your back. It takes practice, but you can definitely build up that resilience!

t3_1169vvf,I always feel sleepy [Need Advice],"I always feel sleepy especially in places I should be wide awake—workplace and school, for instance. I just can't stop myself from dozing off. 

Is this hypersomia? Or laziness?😅 Do you have any realistic tips on how to keep yourself awake?","5 hours is way too little. Everyone’s different but sleepy + minus 3 hours of recommended sleep is a pretty simple answer. Get a few weeks of 8+ see how you adjust. Also go to sleep earlier, sleep quality matters as much as duration and you’re best REM cycles are early evening","If you can please go see a pulmonologist and get a sleep study done.  You may have sleep apnea.  Most common is obstructive sleep apnea but there is also central sleep apnea.  Either way you stop breathing in your sleep, your brain isn't getting enough oxygen and in turn forces your body to wake up to breathe.  You may not even notice you are frequently waking up but it prevents your body from going into the restful stage of sleep.  You dont have to be overweight or unhealthy to have it.  I have severe sleep apnea and have since I was diagnosed 20 years ago as a teen.  I have always exercised and maintained a healthy weight.  You never know until you get a sleep study done.  I have fallen asleep driving, sitting at lunch, standing at work etc.  You name the situation and Inhave nodded out into microsleeps.  It can be terrifying and almost impossible to stop.  Good luck.","Feeling sleepy all the time can be frustrating, especially when you need to be alert. It might be worth checking in with a doctor to rule out any medical issues like hypersomnia or sleep apnea. In the meantime, here are a few tips that might help: 

1. **Sleep Schedule**: Try to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock. 

2. **Morning Routine**: Start your day with some light exercise or stretching to get your blood flowing. It can help wake you up and boost your energy levels.

3. **Diet and Hydration**: Make sure you're eating balanced meals and staying hydrated. Sometimes fatigue can be linked to dehydration or poor nutrition.

4. **Breaks and Movement**: If you find yourself getting sleepy during the day, take short breaks to move around. A quick walk or some light stretching can help re-energize you.

5. **Caffeine**: Use caffeine strategically. A cup of coffee in the morning can help, but try to avoid it in the afternoon to prevent it from affecting your sleep at night.

6. **Environment**: Make your workspace as engaging as possible. Good lighting and a comfortable chair can make a big difference.

Remember, building new habits takes time, so be patient with yourself as you try these strategies. Good luck!","Before jumping to conclusions about hypersomnia or laziness, let's look at the basics that could be causing your sleepiness. Constant drowsiness, especially in important settings, often comes down to sleep quality and daily habits.

First, make sure you're getting 7-9 hours of consistent sleep each night. Going to bed and waking up at the same times helps regulate your body clock. The quality matters as much as quantity - try keeping your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.

Some practical tips to stay alert during the day:
Get some morning sunlight right after waking up - it helps set your circadian rhythm.
Stay hydrated and eat regular meals with protein and complex carbs rather than heavy, sugary foods.
Take short walks every couple hours, especially when you feel drowsy.
Sit near windows for natural light when possible.
Try standing or walking during calls/meetings when you can.

If you're doing all this and still constantly fighting sleep, it's worth seeing a doctor to check for underlying issues like sleep apnea or vitamin deficiencies. There's no shame in getting medical help - better sleep can transform your whole life.

Start with these basic changes and track your energy levels for a couple weeks. Small tweaks to your daily routine often make a bigger difference than willpower alone.","It's great that you're acknowledging the issue and seeking help. While it's possible that you might be experiencing hypersomnia, it's also important to consider other factors that could be contributing to your sleepiness, such as your sleep schedule, diet, and overall lifestyle habits. Before jumping to conclusions, you might want to try a few things to see if they make a difference. For starters, establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help improve the quality of your sleep. Additionally, getting some morning sunlight exposure can help regulate your circadian rhythms, which can help you feel more alert during the day. In terms of staying awake during the day, taking short breaks to stretch or move around can be really helpful - even just a few minutes of fresh air or a short walk can make a big difference. You could also try incorporating some caffeine into your daily routine, but be careful not to overdo it. Lastly, it might be worth speaking with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleepiness. As for whether it's laziness or not, I'd say it's unlikely - it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and seek help for something like this, so kudos to you for taking the first step!","Hey, I totally get that feeling. It's rough trying to stay awake when your body just wants to shut down. Before jumping to conclusions about hypersomnia or laziness, let's look at some common culprits and simple fixes.

First, are you getting enough sleep at night? Aim for 7-9 hours. A consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends) can make a huge difference.

Next, think about your diet. Are you eating balanced meals or relying on sugary snacks and caffeine for energy? Those can lead to crashes. Try incorporating more protein and complex carbs.

Also, dehydration can cause fatigue. Keep a water bottle with you and sip on it throughout the day.

During those sleepy moments, try these: Stand up and stretch, take a quick walk, splash cold water on your face, or engage in a brief, stimulating conversation. If possible, get some natural light.

If these don't help and the sleepiness is seriously impacting your life, it's worth talking to a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Good luck!

t3_pz9i6j,[Need Advice] Where does your self discipline come from?,"I’m in my late twenties and I’ve always struggled with self discipline, it’s never really been a thing i realised the value of up until recently. Even though I have the best of intentions most of the time: I plan, I strategise, I write lists, I make promises to myself that I swear I will keep time and time again, but when it actually comes down to the wire, in the moment,  I am weak and I give in to the dark side of myself.

There’s things in my life that I want to change and to do that requires discipline and willpower- I’m aware these things take time, energy and patience to develop but I’m not sure where/how to start. I know what needs doing but don’t have the discipline to actually DO it.

What are some sources of discipline in your life and how can I engineer my mind to develop discipline?",,,"Hey there! Building discipline is definitely a journey, and it's great that you're ready to start. One thing that really helps is to focus on small, consistent actions rather than big, overwhelming changes. Start by picking one small habit you want to develop—something that takes just a few minutes a day. It could be as simple as making your bed every morning or spending five minutes meditating. The key is consistency. 

Also, try to identify your ""why"" for each goal. Understanding why you want to make a change can give you a stronger motivation to stick with it. When you feel tempted to give in, remind yourself of that reason. 

Another tip is to set up your environment for success. If you're trying to eat healthier, keep junk food out of the house. If you want to exercise more, lay out your workout clothes the night before. 

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Slip-ups happen, and that's okay. What's important is getting back on track without beating yourself up. Over time, these small steps will build into stronger discipline. You've got this!","Self-discipline isn't something we're born with - it's like a muscle that needs consistent training to grow stronger. The key is to start small and build up gradually, rather than trying to transform your entire life overnight.

One effective approach is to pick just ONE small habit to focus on first. Make it tiny and achievable - something you're 90% confident you can do daily. Maybe it's making your bed each morning, drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or doing 2 pushups. The specific habit matters less than building the ""follow-through"" muscle.

The real power comes from keeping that small promise to yourself consistently. Each time you follow through, you're proving to yourself that you can be trusted with commitments. This builds genuine confidence and momentum.

Another game-changer is engineering your environment to make discipline easier. Put your gym clothes out the night before. Delete social media apps from your phone. Keep healthy snacks visible and junk food out of sight. Your willpower is limited, so use it to set up systems that make good choices the path of least resistance.

Remember that discipline isn't about being perfect - it's about getting back on track quickly when you slip up. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Just ask ""What's the next right action I can take?"" and do that.

Start today with one tiny habit. Stick with it for 2 weeks before adding anything else. Build that foundation of self-trust first, then gradually expand from there. You've already taken the first step by seeking to improve - now it's just about consistent small actions over time.","I think a lot of people struggle with developing self-discipline, especially when they're used to giving in to instant gratification. For me, discipline comes from setting clear, achievable goals and tracking progress over time. It's not about being perfect, but about making small wins consistently. One strategy that might help is to start tiny - instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, pick one area you want to improve and commit to a single, daily habit that takes less than 5 minutes to do. It could be as simple as doing 10 push-ups every morning, or writing down three things you're grateful for each night. The key is to build momentum and reinforce the idea that you can follow through on your commitments. As you get more comfortable with this tiny habit, you can gradually increase the difficulty or add new habits to your routine. It's also important to identify your why - what's driving your desire to change, and what will keep you motivated when the going gets tough? Reflecting on these questions and reminding yourself of your purpose can help you stay on track. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up - discipline is a muscle that takes time to develop, and it's okay to have setbacks. Just acknowledge the mistake, learn from it, and get back on track as soon as possible.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's a common struggle! It sounds like you're already doing the right things by planning and strategizing, but the execution is the tricky part.

For me, discipline isn't about being a robot; it's about building systems that make the right choices easier. One thing that really helped me was starting ridiculously small. Like, if you want to exercise, don't aim for an hour at the gym. Aim for 5 minutes of stretching. Seriously. The point is to build the habit of *starting*. Once you're doing 5 minutes consistently, it's way easier to ramp it up.

Another thing is to identify your triggers. What situations or feelings make you more likely to give in? Once you know those, you can plan for them. For example, if you always cave when you're bored in the evening, have a pre-planned alternative activity ready to go.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're going to slip up. It's part of the process. Don't beat yourself up about it; just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Discipline is a muscle, and it takes time and consistent effort to build. Good luck, you got this!

t3_z4421c,[Need advice] what iPhone apps can I use to completely lock myself out of certain apps for an amount of time?,"As the titles says I’m looking for any iPhone apps that can completely lock me out of certain apps for an amount of time. I know the phone has screentime/downtime but the problem I see with that is in two clicks you can ignore the limit for the day and you’re back using the app.

I’m after an app that hard locks for the designated time with no way to access it until that time is up.

Anyone used anything like that before or does it a different way? 

I bought myself a physical lockbox which I love, I’ve been crazy productive with it but I really need to be able to answer calls when they come through.

Any advice helps.

Thanks.","I dont own an iphone but i guess the guys here will help 
But i wanted to clmment one thing , dont you think that using these apps is just a quick fix for a deeper struggle ? 
I mean the lack of self control 

Lets say you managed to use these apps , problem solved

But when the same human find himself in the front of other seductions where there are no apps to ""limit the use"" , then you will look at the core cause because at this poiny people usually get stcuk with self distructive behaviors 

So my advice to you is to find mental and emotional reasons why ylu should limit your use without the apps, this way you will ptactice the self control 
And with time it will be stronger 

If you need more help kn this topic i would be happy to help","Yes it does, however, you can ignore limits with two clicks of a button. I want something that takes that option away from me","Hey there! I totally get the struggle with trying to stay disciplined with app usage. For iPhone, you might want to check out an app called ""Freedom."" It allows you to block specific apps and websites for set periods, and once the block is active, there's no way to bypass it until the time is up. Another option is ""Forest,"" which gamifies staying off your phone by growing a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Both can be great tools to help you stay focused. Also, since you mentioned needing to answer calls, you can customize your Do Not Disturb settings to allow calls from certain contacts while blocking other distractions. Keep experimenting with what works best for you, and good luck with your productivity journey!","There are a few solid app-blocking options for iPhone that are more robust than the built-in Screen Time. Freedom is probably your best bet - it uses VPN configurations to create a true lock that can't be easily bypassed. Forest is another good one that adds a fun twist by growing virtual trees while you stay focused (and killing them if you break focus).

That said, app blockers are just tools - they work best when combined with other strategies. Since you've already had success with the physical lockbox, you might want to try setting up specific ""phone-allowed"" times during the day where you batch-process calls and messages. This way you're not constantly available but also not missing important communications.

You could also try moving distracting apps off your home screen and into a folder on the last page, or even deleting and reinstalling them only during designated usage times. The extra friction often helps reduce mindless checking.

Remember that the goal isn't to permanently lock yourself out, but to build better usage habits over time. Start with short blocking periods (30-60 mins) and gradually increase them as you get more comfortable with focused work. Good luck with finding the right solution for your needs!","You might want to check out apps like Freedom, SelfControl, or Moment. These apps allow you to block specific apps or websites on your iPhone for a set period of time, and they're more restrictive than the built-in Screen Time feature. For example, Freedom can block social media or other distracting apps across all your devices, while SelfControl is an open-source app that can block any app or website you specify. Another option is Cold Turkey, which can block apps or websites on your iPhone and also has a feature to lock you out of certain apps during certain times of the day. These apps often have more robust locking mechanisms than Screen Time, so you won't be able to bypass them with just two clicks. It's worth noting that some of these apps may require you to set up a password or use another form of authentication to unlock them, which can add an extra layer of discipline to your app-blocking routine.","Hey, I get the struggle! It's tough when willpower alone isn't enough.

For iPhone apps that *really* lock you out, check out ""Freedom"" or ""Forest."" Freedom blocks distracting apps and websites across all your devices, and it's pretty hardcore about it. Forest is a bit different – you plant a virtual tree, and if you leave the app, the tree dies. It's a visual motivator.

Beyond apps, have you considered *why* you're reaching for those apps in the first place? Maybe try identifying your triggers. Are you bored? Stressed? Once you know what's causing the urge, you can find healthier coping mechanisms.

Also, instead of just blocking apps, try replacing them with something positive. If you usually scroll Instagram, maybe have a book ready to read instead.

Finally, remember that discipline is a skill, not an innate trait. It takes practice and you'll slip up sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it, just learn from it and keep going. Good luck!

t3_sc91ci,[Need Advice] how to be more strong willed?,"So I had this bad habit of getting too sensitive one someone questions my decisions, like why do you dress like this? Why do you want to work in research? Why do you like cooking western? And then just abandon what I wanted to do in the first place. I think this has to do with their fake freedom to choose, and I don't know what they really want. 

But ever since I told myself I have the right to respond however I want, I am able to answer calmly, or just tell the person to fuck off if I suspect ill intent, this includes my family.

I think I see some improvement? 

I know I'm weak willed, so when I've decided on something nowadays, I make it a point to never go back unless necessary.

=====================

1. 12 years ago, I can't choose skirts for church meetings my parents wanted me to go to. I'd tell them I need a new skirt, and they'd get all pissed and shit while shopping for it. They attend a church that required girls to wear skirts so..... 

I got used to the idea of wearing the same 5 for 3 meetings a week. My mom started allowing me to get nice dresses/skirts etc after the older ladies at church bought me my first bible and some skirts.

But it came with a catch. I get to chose the skirt THEY prefer. In the end we'd buy the skirt I 'chose', but I'd rarely wear it, because I didn't choose it.

Obviously I got scolded because it was indeed a waste of money. I did wear them eventually cuz they were nice, I needed to develop more backbone. 

I get it that their sense of style is better, since I'd always later find their ideas to be pretty good,  but I'd like them to respect the choice they've given me. Moreover, I've caught them and my sister smirking about it. 

=======================

2. 7 years ago I needed a new laptop, so told my mom about it and we'd pay half-half. She was complaining about what kind of specs I want, how am I supposed to get it etc. I thought we were going to just ask our regular laptop guy for recommendations, as we've always done. So I took some time to search online and told her THE EXACT laptop I wanted, and the specs if I can't find the laptop. She got pissed again because 'there's no way she can find the laptop', even though I've told her I CAN GET IT MYSELF. 

In the end, she just bought a laptop based our regular guy's recommendation. It all turned out EXACTLY as I expected, and I just wasted my time researching about computer specs. I say 'researching' cuz my parents would complain about 'do you even know what X means?'

She herself had no idea what to do, and then she got angry at me about it. 

From then on, I'd ask my mom on what she expects. Or I'd be wasting my time like this again. If she dodges my question, I'd go on with my plan. I did that with my new phone.

=============

3. 3 years ago, I got a new phone cuz the old one got stolen. I needed it for work. For whatever reason, my mom thought I can go without. Yeah right, my boss and course mates are gonna contact me through fb messenger. She didnt like that I was going to get it via public transport. 

Why? 'It's not safe' 

I've explained a gazillion times HOW I'm going to get it, and its all routes and hours that I've frequented DAILY. NOTHING has happened to me on the train for nearly 2 years. 

On top of that, my dad complains about how we 'don't know how to use public transport to get around'  whatever that means.

I was pretty pissed that my mom wants X, my dad wants Y. Telling one side to please be considerate has never worked, so I'LL DECIDE FOR MYSELF. So I got my new phone the next day. 

==================

4. Just this weekend, the whole family went grocery shopping together, cuz we had to prepare for a feast potluck next week.

My dad asked me 'since when does our family use mirin?' maybe because it's my dad. When he says FREE CHOICE, he really means it. I just said 'now we do'. 

My mom wanted me to use beef instead of pork for my dish. When I asked why, she didn't answer. I'd need to make changes to the recipe if we're using beef, and honestly it'd be a waste of that beef. I also knew that if the dish tasted bad ON TOP OF not doing things my way, I'd be really pissed. So I said no, and gave my explanation. She was not happy with the answer. But I'm still gonna use pork instead.

Call me inflexible but idk what else to do. No one has ever taught me how to fix my sensitiveness towards people who question my decisions. Now at 27, I still don't know how to fix it.",,,"It sounds like you're making some solid progress in standing up for your choices, which is great! Building a strong will often starts with small steps, like the ones you're taking. Here are a few ideas that might help you continue developing that backbone:

1. **Reflect on Your Values**: Take some time to think about what truly matters to you. When you're clear on your values, it becomes easier to make decisions that align with them, regardless of outside opinions.

2. **Practice Assertiveness**: It seems like you're already doing this by calmly responding or setting boundaries when needed. Keep practicing assertive communication. It’s about expressing your needs and opinions confidently and respectfully.

3. **Set Boundaries**: It’s okay to set boundaries with family and others. You can acknowledge their input but still make your own choices. It’s your life, after all.

4. **Learn from Each Experience**: Every time you stand your ground, reflect on what went well and what you could improve. This will help you build confidence over time.

5. **Seek Support**: Sometimes talking to a friend or a mentor about your experiences can provide new perspectives and encouragement.

Remember, it's a journey, and you're already on the right path by recognizing the need for change and taking action. Keep it up!","From what you've shared, you're actually showing good progress in developing a stronger will - you're setting boundaries and sticking to your decisions despite pushback. That's not being inflexible, that's having healthy self-respect.

Your examples show a clear pattern: you make reasonable, well-thought-out decisions, but others try to override them while claiming to give you ""freedom of choice."" Your recent responses of calmly explaining your reasoning or standing firm on your choices are exactly what a strong-willed person does.

Here's what you can keep building on:

Continue trusting your judgment. You've shown good decision-making skills - researching laptop specs, planning safe transport routes, understanding recipe requirements. Your choices are rational and well-considered.

Keep explaining your reasoning once, clearly and calmly. If someone questions you after that, it's okay to simply say ""This is what I've decided"" and stick to it. You don't need to justify yourself repeatedly.

Remember that being strong-willed isn't about never changing your mind - it's about making conscious choices rather than being pressured into them. When you do adapt your decisions, make sure it's because you see genuine merit in the alternative, not because you're being worn down.

You're already on the right track. What you see as ""sensitivity"" to questioning might actually be a healthy response to having your autonomy repeatedly challenged. Keep practicing standing firm in your choices while remaining calm and composed. That's not weakness - that's exactly what strong will looks like.","It sounds like you've made some significant progress in standing up for yourself and asserting your decisions, which is great. One thing that might help you further is to practice setting clear boundaries and expectations with others, especially your family members. When they question your decisions, try to respond calmly and confidently, explaining your reasoning without feeling obligated to justify or defend yourself excessively.

It's also important to recognize that their opinions or concerns don't necessarily dictate your choices. You've shown that you're capable of making informed decisions, like with the laptop and phone purchases, so trust yourself to do the same in other areas. Remember that it's okay to say no or disagree with others without feeling guilty or sensitive.

In terms of developing a stronger sense of self and decision-making, you might find it helpful to reflect on your values and priorities. What matters most to you? What are your non-negotiables? When you're clear about these things, you'll be more confident in your choices and less swayed by others' opinions.

Lastly, don't worry too much about being seen as ""inflexible."" Setting boundaries and standing up for yourself is not about being rigid or unyielding; it's about being respectful of your own needs and desires. Keep working on building your self-awareness and assertiveness, and you'll become more comfortable making decisions that align with your values and goals.","Hey, it sounds like you're making real progress in standing your ground, and that's awesome! It's tough when family questions your choices, especially when it feels like they're not really respecting your autonomy.

It seems like you've already figured out a key strategy: setting boundaries and sticking to your decisions once you've made them. That's a huge step. Maybe try framing these situations as opportunities to practice your communication skills. Instead of just saying ""no,"" you're already explaining your reasoning, which is great. You could also try anticipating their objections and preparing your responses in advance. This might help you feel more confident and less reactive in the moment.

Also, remember it's okay to not always have a perfect answer or explanation. Sometimes, ""because I want to"" is a valid reason. The more you practice asserting yourself, the easier it will become, and the less sensitive you'll likely feel when people question you. Keep focusing on what *you* want and what makes *you* happy, and let that guide your decisions. You got this!

t3_13q8io6,[Need Advice] How do I manage my work and housework?,"
I am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it’s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. 
I just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .
Is it too much to ask ? Please help.
Also, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.","Cook in Batches like for 2/3 days. It saves a good chunck of time and you can use it for purposes. Also once you get all your veggies, clean and arrange them so you can quickly prepare and start making the food immediately. Some veggies also come precut.","Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it","Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.

Since you’re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some ""me time"" without feeling rushed.

For housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.

Lastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.

Remember, it’s all about finding a balance that works for you. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!","Hey there! Your situation is totally manageable - lots of working professionals face similar challenges with balancing work, cooking, and self-care. Here's what's worked well for others:

Meal prep is going to be your best friend. Pick one day (maybe Sunday) to do most of your cooking for the week. Make larger batches of curry, dal, or whatever you enjoy, and portion them out. You can freeze some portions for later in the week. This front-loads the time investment so you're not cooking daily.

For weekday cooking, start with a ""capsule kitchen"" approach. Keep a limited but versatile set of ingredients that can make multiple dishes. Rice, lentils, common vegetables, and basic spices. This reduces both shopping time and decision fatigue.

Since you're not keen on hiring help (which is completely understandable), try breaking housework into small daily tasks rather than letting it pile up. Maybe 15 minutes of cleaning in the morning and washing dishes right after eating. Put on some music or a podcast - it makes chores more enjoyable.

For morning routine, instead of forcing yourself to wake up super early, focus first on consistency. 8am is fine! Build a reliable routine at that time before trying to shift earlier. A consistent wake time will actually help you feel more energized than constantly fighting to wake up earlier.

Consider doing quick workouts at home to save commute time to a gym. Even 20 minutes of yoga or bodyweight exercises can make a big difference. You could do this while your breakfast is cooking.

Remember - you don't have to perfect everything at once. Start with one area (like meal prep) and once that becomes routine, add another habit. Small, sustainable changes add up to big improvements over time.","It sounds like you're taking on a lot of new responsibilities and wanting to prioritize your work, health, and personal time. First, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of cooking for yourself and wanting to manage your household independently. To save time physically and mentally, consider implementing a few strategies: meal prep on weekends or one day a week, plan your meals for the next few days, and make a grocery list to avoid last-minute shopping trips. You can also look into simple, one-pot recipes that don't require a lot of cleanup. 

For managing your household chores, try breaking them down into smaller tasks that you can fit into your daily routine, like washing dishes immediately after dinner or dedicating 10-15 minutes to tidying up each day. As for waking up earlier, it's great that you're trying to adjust your schedule - start by setting small, achievable goals, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and use that time for a short workout or some stretching.

Remember, it's not about being perfect; it's about finding a balance that works for you. You might need to experiment with different routines and schedules before finding what suits you best. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything right away - focus on making progress, and celebrate your small wins along the way. It's not too much to ask for a better work-life balance, and with time and patience, you can achieve it.","Hey, it sounds like you're taking on a lot at once, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed! It's great that you're trying to build healthier habits and manage your own space.

First, about the food situation: meal prepping is your friend. Since you're already thinking about chopping veggies in advance, dedicate a couple of hours on the weekend to prepping all your ingredients for the week. Think about batch cooking too – make a big pot of something on Sunday that you can eat for lunches or dinners for a few days. There are tons of simple recipes online that require minimal effort. Also, don't feel like every meal has to be a gourmet experience. Sometimes a simple salad or a quick stir-fry is perfectly fine.

Regarding housework, maybe try setting a timer for 15-20 minutes each day to tackle one specific task, like dishes or wiping down surfaces. Small bursts of focused effort can make a big difference. You could also break down cleaning into smaller, more manageable chunks throughout the week.

As for the maid situation, I get your hesitation. Maybe you could try finding someone through a trusted referral or a reputable agency that does background checks. Even having someone come in once a week for a few hours could free up a lot of your time and mental energy.

For workouts, don't feel pressured to wake up super early right away. Start small. Maybe try a 10-minute stretching routine or a quick walk before work. Gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get more comfortable.

Finally, remember to be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect, and there will be days when you slip up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. It's all about progress, not perfection. You got this!

t3_qpvoke,[Need Advice] My shitty sleep schedule is making my depression worse! Tired but can't make myself sleep. Tried everything I could think of," My shitty sleep schedule is making my depression worse. The problem is that its a negative feedback loop. The later I stay up the less willpower I have to force myself to go to sleep.

I take Wellbutrin and it will keep me awake if I take it after like 9 am. The problem is that when I stay up till 2 am, and take it at 10 am I end up staying awake till 3 am the next night. Negative feedback loop!

I've tried all the things I can think of, that aren't just forcing myself to go to sleep because that's the one thing I can't do. I don't have insomnia, I can fall asleep fine as soon as I decide I want to. I get tired.The problem is that I never want to go to sleep. I hate my job and dread getting up and going to work in the morning. I don't want the freedom of ""after work"" to end.

I work from home and my hours are flexible, it's way too easy to stay up till 2 by justifying that my first meeting isn't till 10:30 the next day. But 2 turns into 4 and pretty soon I’m only getting 6 hours of sleep. 

I probably get around 6 - 7 hours of sleep a night. I know it doesn't sound terrible, but I know it is making my severe depression and fatigue even worse. Sometimes it feels like a form of self harm. I force myself to stay awake even when I’m not enjoying it. Even when I’m tired and feel sleepy. I don’t let myself go to sleep. 

I never really want to do anything but lay in bed on YouTube or Reddit and pretend that I don’t exist. I use my willpower to force myself to get out of bed and go to work, buy groceries, eat food, shower and go to the gym. I never look forward to anything, I even dread things I enjoy. Every minute of my life is a fight to push myself to continue. Every day I plan on going to sleep early, but by bedtime I’ve run out of willpower and just can’t make myself do it. 

I’ve done all the things that daytime me can to make nighttime me sleep:

* Red filters on all devices
* Blue light blocking glasses
* A sad light box to use in the mornings (haven’t really used it though, because I keep waking up with a light sensitive headache from sleep deprivation.)
* An analog alarm that is incredibly loud in the bathroom (I turned it off and went back to sleep)
* Sunrise alarm clock (Hurt my eyes and made headache worse)
* LED strips programmed to gradually turn on before wake up time
* Taking nighttime meds (one of which has sleepiness as a side effect) at 10 pm
* Taking melatonin, magnesium, GABA and L theanine (Makes me sleepy, but I just stay up anyway and feel like shit)
* Putting phone charger away from bed (I just ended up not charging my phone)
* Setting my phone to automatically shut down at 2 am (I just turn it on again)
* Having a nice bedtime routine with a cup of herbal tea
* Telling myself that if I get up early enough I’ll go buy a treat from a nearby coffee shop (I just didn’t get up anyway) 

Nighttime me is a clever bitch who can disable anything daytime me sets up to make myself sleep. The things on the list do make me tired, but I just stay awake anyway. I seem to have no consideration for my future self’s suffering so morning wake up calls do nothing. How do I fix this?","I say this with empathy, it sounds like this isn’t as much a problem with your sleep schedule as it is your mental health.

> I never really want to do anything but… pretend that I don’t exist

> I seem to have no consideration for my future self’s suffering

I understand you, because I’ve been there before, and I do hope it gets easier for you like it did for me. Try talking to a therapist? If you can’t, maybe talk to a few friends or family. Or journal things out by yourself, just to have a bit of mental clarity about what’s really affecting you right now. Bad sleep habits are often a symptom of the underlying issue, not the other way around. Please be kind to yourself.","Yea, I kinda had a feeling that the WFH situation was the biggest problem. I'm assuming you already realized this. I know you don't want to switch, but if your in the US there are a metric fuckton of job openings right now. I'd seriously consider it. If not, try to find a reason to go put and mingle, but with something productive and preferably a support group. I did language exchanges to learn Spanish and would use meetup.com and it made going out (which I hate, BTW) extremely fun. If you have a hobby, or maybe could make yourself get into one that has a group that does meetups I'd try that. Also, as for melatonin try .3 mg. I assume you have melatonin pills (I recommend getting the Natrol brand liquid dosed at 1mg and taking one dropper full which is .3mg, roughly) just about 1/15, basically a tiny nibble off the edge and try that. I used to have to take a double dose of Tylenol PM in addition to 5mg of melatonin just to fall asleep. I experienced major memory problems in my 20's until I researched and found the active ingredient in Tylenol PM could cause early onset dementia. Then I found research that showed .3mg of melatonin to be the best sleep aid. Now I can fall asleep at will, and have no issues not wanting to sleep, or fatigue and memory issues like before. Beyond that it sounds lime you know how to have proper sleep hygiene. I think if you can fix these two things you'll be good.","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few ideas that might help you break the cycle:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul your entire sleep schedule at once, aim to go to bed just 15 minutes earlier each night. This gradual change can be more manageable and less overwhelming.

2. **Create a Reward System**: Since you mentioned you dread mornings, try setting up a small reward for yourself if you manage to get up at a certain time. It could be something simple like a special breakfast or a few minutes of a favorite podcast.

3. **Limit Screen Time**: You mentioned using YouTube and Reddit at night. Try setting a specific time to turn off screens, maybe an hour before you want to sleep. Use that time to do something relaxing that doesn't involve screens, like reading a book or listening to calming music.

4. **Reflect on Your Day**: Spend a few minutes each evening reflecting on something positive that happened during the day, no matter how small. This can help shift your mindset and make the idea of ending the day feel less daunting.

5. **Seek Professional Help**: If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies tailored to your situation and help you work through the underlying issues contributing to your sleep struggles.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep experimenting with what works for you. You've got this!","It sounds like the core issue isn't actually about sleep - it's about avoiding tomorrow. When we dread our days, staying up late becomes a form of rebellion against our own lives. The technical solutions you've tried are great, but they're band-aids on a deeper wound.

Here's what I suggest: Start with accepting that you can't hate yourself into changing. Instead of viewing sleep as another obligation, try reframing it as an act of self-care. Your body and mind need rest to fight depression effectively.

For the immediate sleep issue, pick ONE consistent wake-up time and stick to it no matter what time you go to bed. Yes, you'll be exhausted the first few days, but this creates natural sleep pressure for the next night. When your body knows it can't sleep in, it becomes much harder to justify staying up late.

For the bigger picture - you mentioned hating your job. While job hunting isn't easy, especially with depression, start putting out some applications. Even taking small steps toward change can help reduce that feeling of being trapped that's keeping you up at night.

In the meantime, try giving yourself something to look forward to in the mornings. Not a ""if I wake up early"" reward, but something scheduled and prepaid - maybe a weekly breakfast with a friend, or an early morning class you enjoy. Create reasons to want to wake up, rather than just forcing yourself to.

Remember: You're not failing at sleep - you're succeeding at staying awake. You clearly have tremendous willpower; you're just currently using it against yourself. Start redirecting that strength toward building the life you won't want to escape from.","It sounds like you're stuck in a tough cycle, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact of your sleep schedule on your depression. One thing that might be worth trying is to focus on setting small, achievable goals for your nighttime routine, rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. For example, instead of trying to go to bed at 10 pm, try setting a goal to start winding down at 11:30 pm - maybe take a warm bath, practice some gentle stretches, or do some light reading. 

It's also interesting that you mention hating your job and dreading the morning, which might be contributing to your reluctance to go to bed. Have you considered exploring ways to make your work more enjoyable or finding ways to cope with the stress and anxiety it causes? This could be as simple as taking short breaks throughout the day to do something you enjoy, or finding a hobby that brings you joy outside of work.

Additionally, since you've tried so many different strategies to improve your sleep, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you address the underlying issues driving your behavior. They could help you develop coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your depression and anxiety, which in turn might make it easier to establish a healthier sleep routine.

Lastly, it's worth noting that it's not necessarily about having ""willpower"" to go to bed, but rather about creating an environment and routine that supports healthy sleep habits. By focusing on small, incremental changes and addressing the underlying issues driving your behavior, you might find it easier to develop a more consistent and restful sleep schedule.","Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's really frustrating when you feel like you're fighting against yourself. It's great that you've already tried so many things! Since willpower at night is the issue, maybe we can shift the focus to making sleep easier *before* nighttime you takes over.

First, about the Wellbutrin: 10 AM is probably too late if you're aiming for a better sleep schedule. Could you set an alarm for 8 AM (or even earlier) just to take the pill, then go back to sleep? That way, it's processed earlier in the day.

Second, you mentioned dreading work. That's a huge factor. Is there *anything* you can do to make your job even slightly more bearable? Even small changes can make a difference. If not, could you start exploring other job options, even if it's just browsing listings? Having a sense of future possibility might ease the dread.

Third, let's tackle the ""after work"" freedom. You're clinging to it because it's the only time you feel in control. Instead of trying to eliminate that feeling, can you shift it? Plan something small and enjoyable for the *morning* before work. It doesn't have to be big – a walk in the sun, listening to a favorite podcast, or even just savoring your coffee. This gives you something to look forward to and might make going to sleep less of a loss.

Finally, instead of a hard shutdown at 2 AM, try a gradual wind-down. Set an alarm for 11 PM as a ""screen-free"" reminder. No more YouTube or Reddit after that. Read a book, listen to calming music, or do some light stretching. The key is to make it a gentle transition, not a sudden restriction that nighttime you will rebel against.

It's going to take time and consistency, but don't give up. Small, sustainable changes are better than drastic measures that you can't maintain. Good luck!

t3_yk8w5j,[need advice] I (30f) feel lost and don’t even know where to start changing my life,"I really don’t have any self worth or self esteem. A lot stems from me being a failure in life. I’m in my early 30s and only have a bachelors in art history. I have worked as an admin coordinator and don’t make much money. I definitely need a better job but don’t have skills or an education to get one. Other than that I don’t have any friends except for my boyfriend. Lately I signed up for a dance class so I hope I can make a friend there (I’m really shy and have a hard time reaching out). I need to rehaul my life because I’m not the person I want to be, but I just don’t know where to start.","It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure and self worth into what would be better described as a logic problem.   

If what you're doing isn't making you happy, then what might you do differently?  I know we're all creatures of habit, and it's hard to break a rut, especially if you need big changes, but stable homes get built brick by brick, and stable lives are built day by day.   

Try to find the least disagreeable change in the right direction you can tolerate and make it.   As yourself what your daily life would be if you were satisfied, and seek to mirror those actions until they become habit.","I hear ya, Life can be hard. I recently felt quite the same so i can relate to you. I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:

1. Assess my current situation
2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self
3. Create SMART goals 
4. Do a daily review of the day

**Assess the situation**.  
This is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  
I started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  
Infrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  
Then i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  
After that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.

This gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.

**Map out your ideal self**  
I basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.

&#x200B;

**SMART Goals**  
Way to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  
Relevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   


**Daily Review**  
The hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  


So these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life. Feel free to reach out if you wanna chat some more about it.","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're taking a dance class—that's a fantastic step towards meeting new people and building confidence. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to feel a bit lost. Here are a few ideas to help you get started on your journey:

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small, manageable goals that can help build your confidence. It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.

2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields. This could open up new job opportunities and help you feel more accomplished.

3. **Networking**: Since you're shy, try online communities related to your interests. They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.

4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can help build your self-worth and motivate you to keep going.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're already on the right path by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your way. 😊","Hey there - first off, signing up for that dance class was a great step! It shows you're already taking action to improve your life, which is huge.

Let's break this down into manageable pieces. Rather than trying to change everything at once, start with one area and build momentum from there. Since you mentioned wanting better career prospects, that could be a good focus.

Your art history degree isn't a failure - it shows you can complete complex academic work. Many skills from being an admin coordinator are also transferable. Consider looking into project management certifications (like CAPM) or digital marketing courses - these fields often value people with diverse backgrounds and don't require another full degree.

For building confidence and connections, keep going with that dance class! Each week you attend is a small win. Maybe challenge yourself to say hello to one new person each class. Small social interactions add up over time.

Start tracking your daily wins, no matter how small. Did you go to dance class? Win. Learned something new at work? Win. This helps build evidence that you're making progress.

Remember that many successful people didn't have it figured out in their early 30s. You're not behind - you're exactly where you need to be to start making changes. Pick one small thing to improve this week and build from there. What's one tiny step you could take today?","It's amazing that you're recognizing the need for change and taking small steps like signing up for that dance class - that takes a lot of courage, especially when you're shy. One thing you might consider is breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of getting a better job, you could start by updating your resume, or taking online courses to learn new skills. There are many free or low-cost resources available online that can help you build your professional skills, regardless of your education background. As for building your self-worth and self-esteem, it might be helpful to focus on your strengths and the things you enjoy doing, like art history or dance. You could also try setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day or week, and celebrating when you reach them - this can help build momentum and confidence. Remember that changing your life is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now, just start with what feels most important or achievable to you, and go from there.","Hey, it sounds like you're feeling stuck, and that's a really common feeling, especially when you're trying to make big changes. It's great that you've already signed up for a dance class – that's a solid first step!

Since you're feeling overwhelmed, maybe try breaking things down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, pick one or two areas to focus on. For example, you mentioned wanting a better job. Could you spend just 30 minutes a day researching potential career paths that might interest you, even if they seem out of reach right now? Or maybe dedicate 15 minutes to learning a new skill online through free resources like Coursera or Khan Academy. Small, consistent effort adds up over time.

Regarding making friends, since you're shy, maybe focus on just one person in your dance class. Instead of trying to be best friends right away, just aim to have a short conversation after class each week. Ask them about their day or what they thought of the choreography. Baby steps!

The key is consistency, not perfection. Don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Just get back on track the next day. Celebrate the small wins, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. You got this!

t3_w8hhhb,[Need Advice] Coping with severe phone addiction,"I've been working from home for a year - will start going to office twice a week from next month.
Since the beginning of the pandemic I started using my phone excessively.
The main addiction for me is mindlessly scrolling through social media. I'll start with Facebook, then go on to Instagram, then Reddit, linkedin and Twitter and then go down a youtube spiral and back to square one to do it all again.
Now I have multiple accounts on all these platforms and the amount of time I spend on my phone has gone up exponentially. Since last few months it has been hampering my work and productivity as well. I procrastinating and go on my phone and then end up not doing any work all day. I have got away with it so long but I'm really worried thinking about what will happen when I'm in office because I don't want to be checking my phone at all.
I've tried locking the apps, putting a timer, uninstalling the apps, deactivating my accounts but I still end up finding my way to get back to it within few hours. It makes me feel even worse!
I would really appreciate any help, advice or even motivation to help me get over this bad habit.",One solution which worked for one of co-workers is getting a new phone. Don't put any apps in it except the contacts. Leave the other phone containing all the apps at your home or to a neighbour's house (if you are not confident about you going home to fetch it between office hours). Reward yourself at the end of the day by using your old phone. Repeat.,"I think you should give the [lockbox](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Safe-Locking-Container-Height/dp/B00JGFQTD2/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=snack%2Block%2Bbox&qid=1634731746&sr=8-8&th=1) a shot! I have one and there is literally no way you can get your phone out before the timer. It's a bit of a cold turkey way, but it drastically helped cut my phone addiction.","Hey there! It sounds like you're really aware of the impact this habit is having, which is a great first step. Here are a few strategies that might help you regain control:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Start by designating specific times for phone use. Maybe allow yourself 15 minutes in the morning and evening. Use alarms to remind you when it's time to stop.

2. **Create Friction**: Make it harder to access these apps. You could try moving them to a different screen or folder, or even logging out after each use so you have to log back in every time.

3. **Replace the Habit**: Find an activity to replace the scrolling. It could be reading a book, going for a walk, or even a quick workout. The key is to have something ready to do when you feel the urge to pick up your phone.

4. **Mindfulness Practice**: Sometimes, just being aware of the urge can help. When you feel the need to check your phone, take a moment to pause and ask yourself if it's really necessary.

5. **Accountability**: Share your goal with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable. Sometimes just knowing someone else is aware can be a big motivator.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Every small step you take away from the phone is a win. Good luck!","Phone addiction is tough because our devices are designed to be addictive, but going to the office gives you a perfect opportunity for a reset. Here's what's worked for others in similar situations:

Start by making your phone boring and inconvenient. Delete all social media apps and only access them through your browser. This adds friction and makes mindless checking less appealing. Then put your phone in grayscale mode - it makes everything less visually rewarding.

For the office transition, get a basic morning routine locked in now. Put your phone in another room while you work. If you need it nearby, keep it in a drawer or bag where you can't see it. The physical barrier helps break the automatic reach-for-phone response.

Replace the phone habit with specific activities during breaks. Take a quick walk, chat with coworkers, or read a book. Having predetermined alternatives makes it easier to avoid defaulting to scrolling.

Most importantly, be patient with yourself. You've recognized the issue and are taking steps to address it. That's huge. Start implementing these changes now while WFH so you're prepared for the office. Each day you maintain better phone habits builds momentum for lasting change.

Remember - the goal isn't to never use your phone, but to be intentional about when and how you use it. You've got this.","It's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to make a change, especially with your work schedule shifting soon. One strategy that might help is to identify the triggers that lead you to mindless scrolling - is it boredom, stress, or something else? Once you know what's driving the behavior, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises when you feel the urge to scroll. 

Another approach could be to set specific phone-free times and zones, like during work hours or in certain areas of your home. Since you've tried app blockers and timers before, you might consider implementing a ""phone dock"" system where you leave your phone in a designated spot, like a docking station or a box, when you're not using it for work or other essential tasks.

It's also worth exploring why you feel the need to have multiple accounts on all these platforms - is it FOMO, a sense of obligation, or something else? Simplifying your online presence might help reduce the temptation to scroll. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it's a process to break a habit, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging the problem and seeking help, so that's something to build on.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Phone addiction is a real struggle, especially with the WFH situation. It sounds like you've already tried some of the common solutions, which is good, but let's dig a little deeper.

Since you're heading back to the office soon, let's focus on that as a hard deadline. Start small. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, aim for specific phone-free blocks of time each day leading up to your office return. Maybe start with 2-hour blocks where your phone is in another room. Use a regular alarm clock instead of your phone alarm.

Also, think about *why* you're reaching for your phone. Boredom? Stress? Loneliness? Identify the triggers and find alternative activities. If it's boredom, maybe have a book or some quick exercises ready. If it's stress, try a short meditation or some deep breathing.

Since you've deactivated accounts before, maybe try a more radical approach: delete the apps entirely and only access those platforms on a desktop browser, and only during specific times. The extra friction of having to log in each time might be enough to deter you.

Finally, don't beat yourself up when you slip up. It's going to happen. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. Maybe keep a small journal to track your progress and identify patterns. You got this!

t3_14h6c47,"[Need advice] my brain is fried, I’ve avoided learning for years and it’s catching up to me at the age of 30","
Growing up, I didn’t have the motivation as a child. My parents were abusive in their own ways, and to each other. So I think that somewhat had a part in it. My mom got a divorce and that was super stressful on her with 4 kids to raise alone. So that’s 4 kids to constantly help with homework and there’s areas she didn’t remember or know about. No encouragement to join sports, etc. I know it was really hard for her and to keep up with 4 kids. She really tried her best. 

I lack knowledge in history, I know very few about our history. It never interested me. Throughout school, were given cheat sheets from our instructors to study from, based off our books. It was easy for us to pass the class. 

I was only really good at math in school, some of science, English, writing, etc. 

I want to be able to articulate what I’m saying. I can write it out but when I speak, it comes out all scrambled and it makes me even more anxious when I’m talking to someone. 

If a subject doesn’t interest me or I find it boring, it’s very hard for me to continue to learn/finish the assignment. 

To be honest, I don’t read. I used to love it as a child and collected books but idk what happened, I lost interest. I can’t find the motivation or interest to pick up a book. But I’ll read the news here and there, etc. that’s about it. 

I want to expand my vocabulary, be able to articulate, learn more about history (idk where to even begin).

I’m not even educated enough in politics, who most of our politicians are, etc. I never had much interest in it. I rarely keep up with the news (rarely watch tv anymore ever since I moved out of my mom’s house), I used to keep up with it with her. 

I also have a hard time learning, I think that may be due to me being partially deaf all my life. My ENT doctor refused hearing aids for me since I was a child. I recently met with a different audiologist 2 years ago and ask her about hearing aids and she said I’ve always qualified for it, she seemed really upset that I never received anything. She did mention that I’ve missed out on “so much learning,” from not having hearing aids. 

Sometimes it’s hard for me to comprehend what I’ve read, and to focus on it. So I’ll have to reread the whole thing again, or that sentence/paragraph, which frustrates me. I can’t sit and read for so long before I get distracted. 

I’ve also been going through very, very deep depression. With that, I’m even more disinterested and unmotivated.

I feel SO stupid and uneducated. When people talk to me about history, politics, anything that I lack knowledge in, I get so embarrassed and don’t know how to respond.","This sounds like ADHD. Check out the sub, do some research, and get an EVAL. After I was diagnosed and started getting medicated my anxiety, depression, malaise and inability to focus went away. I’m doing so much better at work, and and starting school soon. Just look into it. 

- Adult diagnosed person","Even as a child? I feel like I’ve been lazy all my life when it comes to learning

I’m a nurse. So all of the science courses were easy to me and since I was so interested in it (some subjects I forgot, because it was boring to me), I was able to sit down and study, watch videos, for hours and hours. 

When it came to writing APA papers, I was really good at writing them and got great scores. However, they were often late because the assignment required several pages, over subjects I had no interest in. I also can’t sit long and write a few papers in one sitting because I get distracted easily, or I get frustrated easily. 

I feel lazy and so stupid/ignorant, because I lack critical information that EVERYONE should know about (history, politics, etc.) Even what seems basic vocabulary to everyone else, I may lack in. I want to be able to use bigger words and know how to use them.

I feel SO behind and thinking about all of this makes me anxious af every single day","Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make changes. It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate, and it's understandable that learning might have taken a backseat. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one area you're interested in, like history or politics, and start with short articles or podcasts. This can make it less overwhelming and more engaging. 

2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Instead of trying to learn everything at once, set small, achievable goals. For example, aim to read one article a day or listen to a podcast episode a week.

3. **Use Technology**: There are apps and audiobooks that can help with learning, especially if reading is tough. Audiobooks might be a great way to reintroduce yourself to reading without the pressure of sitting down with a book.

4. **Practice Articulation**: Try speaking out loud what you've learned, maybe even record yourself. It can help with organizing your thoughts and getting comfortable with speaking.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, everyone learns at their own pace. It's okay to not know everything. Celebrate the small victories and progress you make.

6. **Seek Support**: If depression is making things harder, consider reaching out to a professional. They can offer support and strategies to help with motivation and focus.

You're not alone in this, and taking these steps is already a big move forward. Keep going, and remember that progress is progress, no matter how small.","First off - you're not stupid. You're someone who had a challenging childhood and missed out on some key support systems, including proper hearing assistance that could have made learning easier. The fact that you're here asking these questions shows self-awareness and a desire to grow - that's actually pretty impressive.

Let's start small and build from there. Since you mentioned having trouble focusing and getting overwhelmed, trying to tackle everything at once would probably backfire. Instead, pick ONE area you'd like to improve first. Based on your post, maybe start with reading since that's something you used to enjoy.

Here's a practical approach: Set aside just 10 minutes a day to read. That's it. Make it the same time each day, like right after breakfast or before bed. Start with topics you naturally find interesting - it doesn't have to be heavy history or politics right away. The goal is to rebuild your reading habit and concentration gradually.

For comprehension issues, try reading out loud (when you're alone) and using your finger to track the words. This engages multiple senses and can help with focus. If you need to reread something, that's completely normal - many people do this, especially with complex material.

Once you've got a steady reading habit going (give it at least a month), you can start branching out into other subjects. For history and politics, there are some great ""starter"" YouTube channels that break down complex topics into engaging stories. This can be less overwhelming than diving straight into books.

Regarding articulation - practice explaining what you've read to yourself in the mirror. It sounds silly, but it works. Start with simple topics you're comfortable with, then gradually work up to more complex subjects.

Most importantly - be patient with yourself. You're essentially rebuilding neural pathways and learning habits that weren't properly developed earlier. It takes time, but it's absolutely doable. Focus on small, consistent steps rather than trying to transform everything at once.","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like your upbringing and struggles with learning. First, let's ditch the idea that you're ""stupid"" or ""uneducated"" - those labels aren't helpful and don't reflect your potential for growth. It's great that you're recognizing the impact of your past experiences on your current situation, and that you're willing to work on building your knowledge and skills.

Given your challenges with focus and comprehension, it might be helpful to start small. Instead of trying to tackle a whole book, begin with short articles or podcasts on topics that interest you. You could also try using text-to-speech software or apps that can help with reading comprehension. Additionally, consider exploring different formats for learning, such as documentaries, TED talks, or online courses, which might be more engaging and easier to follow than traditional texts.

It's also important to address your hearing loss and how it may be affecting your ability to learn. Now that you've had a second opinion from an audiologist, it might be worth exploring hearing aids or other assistive technologies that can help you better absorb information.

As for building your vocabulary and articulation skills, you could try practicing with a language learning app or website, like Duolingo or Coursera. These resources often have interactive exercises and quizzes that can help you build confidence in your communication skills.

Lastly, don't underestimate the impact of depression on your motivation and focus. It's essential to prioritize your mental health and seek support from professionals who can help you manage your symptoms. With the right tools and mindset, you can start making progress towards your goals, even if it feels like a small step at a time. Remember that learning is a lifelong process, and it's never too late to start building new skills and knowledge.","Hey, it sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders, but the fact that you're recognizing these things and wanting to improve is a huge first step. Don't beat yourself up too much about the past; focus on what you can do now.

First, address the depression. Seriously. It's incredibly difficult to build any kind of discipline when you're dealing with depression. Talk to a doctor or therapist. There are resources available, and getting that under control will make everything else much easier.

Second, get those hearing aids! The audiologist is right; you've been missing out, but it's not too late. This could significantly improve your comprehension and focus.

For the learning itself, start small and make it enjoyable. Trying to cram everything at once will be overwhelming. Since you used to love reading, maybe revisit that. Don't force yourself to read dense history books right away. Find a genre you enjoy – fiction, fantasy, whatever – and just start reading for pleasure. Even 15 minutes a day. This will help rebuild the habit and expand your vocabulary naturally.

For history and politics, podcasts or documentaries can be a great way to learn passively. You can listen while you're doing chores or commuting. Find ones that are engaging and not too dry. ""Stuff You Missed in History Class"" is a popular one.

As for articulating yourself, practice makes perfect. Try talking to yourself in the mirror about a topic you're learning. Or, even better, find a friend or family member who's willing to listen and give you feedback. Don't be afraid to stumble; it's part of the process.

Finally, be patient with yourself. You're essentially retraining your brain, and that takes time and effort. Celebrate small victories and don't get discouraged by setbacks. You've got this!

t3_yg8u92,"[Need Advice] how do you find the drive, consistency and passion to work on your life? instead of being lazy and living in the past..","So I'm 26 but I can't find the drive and consistency inside of me to work on my life. It seems as if I'm living and walking in life without a purpose. It feels detrimental and it's an emotionally tense feeling.  

How do you burn the fire within you to spark some awareness in your life? How do we gain confidence and awareness to build? 

Can anyone please advise me",Jump on testosterone and start pumping iron,"First, know you're worth the struggle and not forced to live by your environments standards

Second, know your feelings are worth having and listening to

Third, know that you only fail when you die. If you're alive you can build again.

If you don't know the first then that'll be the biggest hurdle. Focus on getting to know yourself by reflecting on each experience and feeling. Acknowledge they exist, then you can start to find the patterns.

From there it's up to you to accept that information","Hey there! It sounds like you're in a bit of a rut, and that's totally okay—many of us have been there. Finding drive and consistency often starts with small, manageable steps. First, try setting a simple goal that excites you, even if it's something small like reading a book or learning a new skill. Break it down into tiny, daily actions that you can commit to. Consistency is key, so focus on building a routine around these actions. 

Also, consider reflecting on what truly matters to you. Sometimes, writing down your thoughts or talking to someone can help clarify your values and what you want out of life. This can ignite that inner fire you're looking for. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. Celebrate your small wins along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself. You've got this!","Finding your drive starts with small wins, not waiting for motivation to magically appear. The truth is, passion often follows action rather than the other way around. Start by picking just ONE area of your life you want to improve and commit to a tiny daily action - something so small you can't talk yourself out of it. Maybe that's 5 minutes of exercise, reading 2 pages of a book, or spending 10 minutes learning a new skill.

The key is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about making massive changes right away. Focus on showing up every day for that small commitment. Track it in a simple way, like marking days on a calendar. Those small wins start building momentum and self-trust.

As for finding purpose - purpose emerges from doing things that matter to you, not from thinking about it. Try different activities and pay attention to what energizes you versus what drains you. What problems do you notice that you'd like to help solve? What topics naturally grab your interest?

Remember that your past doesn't define your future. Each day is a new opportunity to take one small step forward. The ""fire within"" isn't something you find - it's something you build gradually through consistent action, no matter how small. Start today with just one tiny commitment to yourself, and build from there.","Finding drive and consistency can be tough, especially when it feels like you're stuck in a rut. For me, it's been helpful to start small and set super achievable goals for myself, like dedicating 10-15 minutes a day to something I've been putting off or wanting to work on. It could be as simple as journaling, reading, or even just taking a short walk. The key is to build momentum and create a sense of accomplishment, which can help spark that fire within you. 

It might also be helpful to explore what's been holding you back from pursuing your goals and passions. Is it fear, procrastination, or something else? Once you identify the obstacles, you can start working on strategies to overcome them. And don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results - building confidence and awareness takes time, patience, and self-compassion.

As for gaining confidence and awareness, I think it's about being kind to yourself and acknowledging that it's okay to not have everything figured out. You're 26, and it's completely normal to still be exploring your passions and purpose. Try to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than getting caught up in regrets about the past or worries about the future. And hey, seeking advice and being willing to make changes is a huge step in itself - that takes a lot of courage, so kudos to you for taking the first step!","Hey, I get where you're coming from. Feeling lost at 26 is way more common than you think. It sounds like you're looking for a spark, and that's a great first step.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life at once, maybe try focusing on one small thing you can improve each week. Seriously, just *one*. Could be as simple as making your bed every morning, going for a 20-minute walk, or reading for 15 minutes before bed. The key is consistency.

That feeling of purpose often comes *after* you start doing something, not before. So pick something, anything, that seems mildly interesting and commit to it for a month. Don't worry about being ""passionate"" about it right away. Just show up.

As for confidence, that's built through small wins. Each time you stick to your commitment, you're proving to yourself that you can do it. That builds momentum.

Finally, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. It happens. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. You got this!

t3_y27zmv,[Need Advice] How to escape from escapism?,">TLDR:  How do I escape from escapism?

The title says it all. I find myself escaping from my problems, and indulge myself in other (less important) activities that wastes my time. I understand it won't help me or be productive in anyway but i can't help it. 
After a lot of contemplating I figured it's just me trying to escape from everything that's even mildly unpleasant. It is stagnating my growth and I'm just sick of it.

So I've come here asking for your help","I'd suggest to try breaking down the 'complex' problem into the smaller (and simpler) one(s)

For example: 

1**) Escapism:** you mentioned you're trying to escape problems. Fine. Can you list down these things that you tried to escape? What were/are these? When did you do it last time? What was your 'excuse' for doing so? Or maybe it was a distraction? Make a list of things and just check them. 

The goal is that once you do a list of something - it stops being 'complex' or 'scary'. You just see all things you did 'wrong' (or scaped) - and you see that they aren't that numerous. You see that they are real, and realistic to be 'beaten' / fixed.

Besides that, it helps you analyze: okay - thing X I need, so I should find a way to 'stop escaping' it. Thing Y - well, maybe I don't need it. Let's cross-check it altogether, let's not waste time on it. Try to make priorities - which things you'd like to stop escaping in first place.

**2) Actvities that waste your time:** you mentioned these too. Okay - I assume that part of your escapism comes from activities that distract you. Not sure what these are, but let's imagine (for example) it's social media. 

Fine - for the list of things you 'escaped', out of 10 things - let's imagine that 5 were 'escaped' due to social media distraction. If it's true - you know your main enemy. Focus on making a habit of blocking social media from your life, or limitiing it at least. If it's something else - doesn't matter, simply allocate resources to beat this bad habit (or habits).

**This excercise** itself is very, very simple, you can do it with pen and sheet of paper easily. However, personally I prefer doing such things in google sheets - just to save it in [one single file](https://maxreva.com/a-single-file-framework-does-magic-with-your-habits/) (I shared more about this concent in my post before). Getting back to this same file will help you a lot, because it'll be your ""center for fighting escapism"" in some way. And a place where your next decisions/healthy habits might be started from.","escaping escapism? sounds like getting out a nail with another nail. 
Face your problems head on. It’s the only way. The only way out, is through. I know it sucks, sounds painful, and we want to avoid it, thus our dilemma. 

The more you do it, the less it hurts, the less of a burden it becomes and you just get to know yourself better to bring yourself to do *whatever it is you’re attempting to achieve*","Escapism is something a lot of us struggle with, so you're definitely not alone. One approach to tackle this is to start small and gradually build up your discipline. First, identify the specific activities you use for escapism and set limits on them. For example, if you find yourself binge-watching shows, decide on a specific time limit for watching each day. 

Next, try to replace some of that escapism time with activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or going for a walk to clear your mind. 

Also, consider setting small, achievable goals for the tasks you're avoiding. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming. Reward yourself for completing these tasks, even if it's just a small treat or a break to do something you enjoy. 

Lastly, remember that it's okay to seek help if you need it. Sometimes talking to someone about what you're avoiding can provide new insights and motivation. Keep at it, and be patient with yourself as you work on building better habits.","Escaping from challenges is a really common human response - our brains are wired to seek comfort and avoid discomfort. The key is gradually building your ""discomfort muscle"" rather than trying to transform overnight.

Start by picking just ONE mildly uncomfortable but important task each day. Set a timer for just 10 minutes and commit to working on it for that short duration. When the timer goes off, you can choose to continue or stop - but usually once you start, it's easier to keep going.

A helpful mindset shift is viewing discomfort as a signal of growth rather than something to avoid. When you notice yourself reaching for escape activities, pause and ask ""What am I trying to avoid right now?"" Then break that challenging thing into smaller, more manageable pieces.

You might also try the ""if/then"" technique: ""If I feel the urge to escape into [activity], then I will first spend 10 minutes on [important task]."" This creates a small barrier between the impulse and the escape behavior while building positive momentum.

Remember that perfect discipline isn't the goal - progress is. Even small steps toward facing challenges instead of avoiding them will compound over time. You've already taken a positive step by recognizing the pattern and seeking to change it.","Escapism can be a tough cycle to break, but recognizing the pattern is a huge first step. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - what are the specific situations or emotions that make you want to escape? Once you know what's driving your escapism, you can start working on more constructive ways to cope with those feelings. For example, if you're avoiding a particular task because it feels overwhelming, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Or, if you're using escapism to avoid stress or anxiety, consider replacing it with a healthier habit like exercise, meditation, or journaling. It might also be helpful to set clear goals for yourself and create an environment that supports productivity - this could mean turning your phone off during certain hours of the day, or finding a quiet workspace where you can focus. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and indulge in enjoyable activities occasionally, but by being more mindful of your habits and setting boundaries for yourself, you can start to build more discipline and make progress on the things that matter to you.","Hey, I get it. Escapism is a tough cycle to break. It sounds like you've already done the hardest part – recognizing the problem and wanting to change. That self-awareness is huge.

Instead of trying to eliminate escapism entirely (which is super hard), maybe try to manage it and redirect that energy. Start small. Pick *one* thing you're avoiding and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, if you're avoiding studying, commit to just reading one page. Seriously, just one. Often, getting started is the biggest hurdle.

Also, think about *why* you're escaping. What's the unpleasant thing you're trying to avoid? Is it fear of failure? Boredom? Once you identify the root cause, you can start addressing that directly. Maybe that means finding a study buddy, changing your environment, or just acknowledging that it's okay to not be perfect.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're not going to be perfect overnight. There will be days you slip up. Don't beat yourself up about it. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. Small, consistent steps are way more effective than trying to make massive changes all at once. Good luck, you got this!

Building discipline and setting realistic goals can help you move forward. Start by breaking down your long-term goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and help you build confidence as you achieve each step. Also, try to set aside time to connect with others, even if it's just small interactions at first. Building a support network can be really beneficial. Remember, it's okay to fail and learn from it—failure is a part of growth. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. You've got this!","Being put on a pedestal can create some really challenging mental blocks. The good news is that you've already taken a huge step by recognizing how this has affected you. Now let's work on moving forward.

Start by redefining success on your own terms, not your family's. Make a list of what YOU want to achieve, broken down into tiny, manageable steps. When those steps feel overwhelming, make them even smaller. Instead of ""get a great career,"" try ""spend 15 minutes researching one company"" or ""update one section of my resume.""

For the social aspect, consider joining some activity-based groups (sports, hobbies, volunteering) where the focus isn't on achievement but on shared interests. This takes the pressure off and lets you build connections naturally.

Remember that failure isn't the opposite of success - it's a necessary part of it. Every successful person has a long list of failures behind them. Try deliberately doing something small that you might fail at, like learning a new skill. Each time you survive a small failure, you build resilience for bigger challenges.

Take it one day at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Focus on making small improvements and celebrating those wins, no matter how minor they seem. Progress isn't always linear, and that's completely normal.","It's great that you're recognizing the impact your upbringing has had on your life, and that's a huge step forward. Now, it's about breaking free from those expectations and forging your own path.

This can help build confidence and get you moving towards your career and long-term goals without feeling overwhelmed by the fear of failure. Additionally, consider seeking out social connections in low-stakes environments, like hobby groups or volunteer work, where you can meet new people without feeling like you're under a microscope. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that failure is a natural part of growth - your family may have set high expectations, but it's up to you to redefine what success means to you.","Hey, that sounds like a tough situation, but recognizing it is the first and biggest step! It's common to feel paralyzed by expectations, especially when they've been built up over time.

Here's a thought: break down those ""career and long term goals"" into ridiculously small, manageable steps. Like, *tiny*. Instead of ""get a dream job,"" think ""spend 15 minutes researching one company I find interesting."" The goal isn't to achieve anything big right away, it's just to start building momentum and proving to yourself that you *can* start.

As for the fear of failure, try reframing it. Instead of seeing failure as a reflection of your worth, see it as a learning opportunity. Every ""failure"" is just data that helps you adjust your approach. Easier said than done, I know, but actively trying to shift your perspective can make a difference.

And regarding making friends, maybe join a club or group based on a shared interest. It takes the pressure off having to be ""impressive"" and gives you a natural way to connect with people. Good luck, you got this!

t3_11wbp45,[Need Advice] Fixing Sleeping Schedule,For those whom had poor sleeping habits what steps did you take to fix it? Any advice would be tremendously helpful. I always end up stay awake till late and waking up in the morning feeling tired and groggy.,"Early morning sunlight, and sunlight around the sunset time to reset circadian rhythms. Todo lists before bed. Conscious breathing before bed or meditation. Dim soft lighting an hour or two before bed. No bright lights in general including screen time. Replace screen time with book. Hot shower before bed. Cold temperature in room. Magnesium and maybe l-Theanine, do research for dosage. Working out. Cutting out sugar. Cutting out caffeine late in the day. 

There’s a podcast that has been nice as it explains what’s helpful and why it is helpful called The Huberman Lab. Andrew Huberman teaches neurobiology at Stanford and is a legend check out anything on sleep.",,"Hey there! Fixing a sleep schedule can be tough, but with some consistency, you can definitely get there. Start by setting a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock. Try to wind down at least an hour before bed by avoiding screens and doing something relaxing like reading or meditating. Also, pay attention to your caffeine and sugar intake, especially in the afternoon and evening, as they can keep you up. If you find yourself lying awake, get up and do something calming until you feel sleepy again. It might take a bit of time, but stick with it, and you'll start to see improvements. Good luck!","Here's what helped me fix my sleep schedule - it takes consistency but it's totally doable:

First, set a non-negotiable wake-up time and stick to it every single day, even weekends. Your body clock needs that consistency. When the alarm goes off, immediately get up and get some sunlight - even just standing by a window helps signal to your brain that it's time to be awake.

The key is working backwards from your wake time to figure out when you need to start winding down. If you need to be up at 7am, start your bedtime routine by 10pm. No screens for that last hour - the blue light really messes with your natural sleep signals. Instead, do some light stretching, read a physical book, or listen to chill music.

Make your bedroom as sleep-friendly as possible: cool temperature, as dark as you can get it, and maybe some white noise if that helps you. Some people find a weighted blanket helps them stay asleep better too.

The first few days are the toughest, but stick with it. Your body will start naturally getting tired earlier and waking up will get easier. If you mess up one night, don't give up - just get back on schedule the next day. Good sleep is worth the effort - it makes everything else in life so much more manageable.","Fixing your sleep schedule can be tough, but it's definitely doable with a solid plan. One thing that helped me and many others is establishing a consistent bedtime routine - this signals to your brain that it's time to wind down. Try setting a specific bedtime and wake-up time, and stick to it even on weekends. Also, create a relaxing pre-sleep routine, like reading a book or taking a warm bath, to help you unwind. Another key thing is to optimize your sleep environment - make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can suppress melatonin production. It might also be helpful to gradually adjust your sleep schedule instead of trying to change it drastically overnight. For example, if you're used to staying up till 2 am, try going to bed at 1:45 am for a few days, then 1:30 am, and so on. This can help your body adjust more easily. Remember, it might take some time to notice improvements, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see results right away.","Hey, I've been there!

Second, create a relaxing bedtime routine. Maybe a warm bath, reading a book (a real one, not a screen!), or some gentle stretching. Avoid screens (phone, TV, computer) for at least an hour before bed – the blue light messes with your melatonin.

Third, make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Blackout curtains, earplugs, and a fan can be game-changers.

t3_whyc6x,Women who made a comeback [Need Advice],"Hey, I (26F) have been stuck for a while now. I waited tables throughout my 20’s and flunked out of college multiple times. 

I wanted to know if any women would be willing to share their stories of having a career come back a bit later in life. 

I wanted to ask women because I am afraid if I start seriously dating before I get a career going, I will get married have children, and never get the full thriving career I dreamed of. So this is also about finding a partner later in life too I guess. (I know women can have a family and a fulfilling career. I just want to make sure I have some money of my own before settling down) 

So, if there’s any women who like me didn’t have much ambition in her early 20’s but turned it around, how’d you do it?


Any advice is appreciated 
Thanks

Edit ( Thanks for your stories. These really gave me a better perspective )",Juat wanna point out.... many women have neither a career nor children,Are you saying neither of these things are required to have a happy life?,"Hey there! First off, it's awesome that you're thinking about your future and wanting to make a change. It's never too late to start building the career you want. Many women have found success later in life, and you can too. 

One practical step is to identify what you're passionate about or interested in. Once you have a direction, consider taking online courses or certifications to build skills in that area. This can be a flexible way to learn while still working. Networking is also key—connect with people in the field you're interested in, whether through LinkedIn or local meetups. They can offer guidance and maybe even job leads.

As for balancing dating and career, it's all about setting boundaries and priorities. You can date and still focus on your career goals. Just be clear with yourself and any potential partners about your ambitions. Remember, it's your journey, and you get to decide the pace. You've got this!","26 is still so young - you have plenty of time to build the career you want! Many successful women started their careers or made major pivots in their late 20s and 30s. Your waitressing experience likely gave you valuable skills in customer service, multitasking, and working under pressure that will serve you well.

The key is to pick a direction and start taking small, consistent steps. First, identify what career path interests you. Then break down the requirements into manageable chunks - maybe that's finishing a degree, getting certifications, or building specific skills. Start with one class or one certification at a time rather than overwhelming yourself.

Regarding relationships - having your own career and financial independence absolutely makes sense before settling down. But remember that building a career and dating aren't mutually exclusive. You can date while focusing primarily on your professional development. The right partner will support your ambitions.

Consider reaching out to women in fields you're interested in for informational interviews. Many are happy to share their paths and advice. You might also look into professional women's organizations in your area - they often provide mentorship and networking opportunities.

Your past attempts at college don't define your future. What matters is what you do from here. Start small, stay consistent, and keep your eyes on your long-term goals. You've got this!","I love seeing posts like this because it's a great reminder that it's never too late to make a change. I've seen many women share their stories of turning their lives around in their 20s, 30s, and even 40s, and it's truly inspiring. For you, it might be helpful to start by identifying what's holding you back from pursuing your career goals right now. Is it lack of direction, fear of failure, or something else? Once you pinpoint the obstacle, you can start working on a plan to overcome it. 

It's also great that you're thinking ahead and considering how your future relationships might impact your career aspirations. Having a supportive partner can make a huge difference, but it's equally important to establish your own financial stability and independence before settling down. You might consider setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, like taking online courses, attending workshops, or volunteering in your desired field to gain experience and build your network.

Remember, building a career and finding a fulfilling life is a marathon, not a sprint. It's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. Many women have successfully balanced their careers and family life, and you can too. Keep in mind that it's all about making progress, not perfection. You got this, and it's amazing that you're taking the first steps towards creating the life you want.","Hey, your post really resonates. It's super common to feel a bit lost in your early 20s, and it's awesome you're thinking proactively about your future.

First off, don't beat yourself up about the past. Waiting tables builds resilience and people skills, and college isn't the only path. It sounds like you're ready for a change, and that's the most important thing.

As for career advice, maybe start by exploring different fields that genuinely interest you. Informational interviews are gold – reach out to women in careers you admire and ask about their journey. LinkedIn is great for this. You can also try volunteering or taking online courses in areas you're curious about to test the waters without a huge commitment.

Regarding the relationship aspect, it's smart to prioritize your financial independence. Building a career you're proud of will boost your confidence and make you a more empowered partner, whenever you decide to settle down. Don't feel pressured to follow a timeline.

Discipline-wise, start small. Pick one actionable goal related to your career exploration (e.g., ""apply for one job/internship per week"" or ""complete one online course module"") and track your progress. Celebrate small wins to stay motivated. Consistency is key. You got this!

t3_135fnzo,[Need Advice] I'm addicted to eating especially junk food like chocolates,"If you saw my previous post, I have an update: I managed to reduce my rice portion but now I'm addicted to eating junk food especially chocolates. It's just get worse everyday and it's probably been about a month since I started eating a lot of junk food and gained weight. Need help how to stop.","A couple of things:

Try not to bring junk food into your house - you only need to say no once at the store, you need to do it 1000 times at home. Manage your environment - create friction between you and the food.

Eat more protein - it triggers satiation hormones in your food and will reduce hunger

Find a healthy alternative - I like apple slices with peanut butter, works great for me",just don't. this is how it all starts.,"Hey there! It's great that you're aware of the issue and looking to make a change. Here are a few steps that might help you get back on track:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Try to figure out what situations or emotions lead you to reach for junk food. Is it stress, boredom, or something else? Once you know your triggers, you can work on addressing them directly.

2. **Healthy Alternatives**: Stock up on healthier snacks that you enjoy. If you have a sweet tooth, try fruits like berries or apples. Sometimes just having a healthier option available can make a big difference.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Practice being more mindful when you eat. This means paying attention to the taste, texture, and satisfaction of your food. It can help you enjoy your meals more and reduce the urge to snack mindlessly.

4. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of cutting out all junk food at once, try setting small, achievable goals. For example, limit yourself to a certain amount of chocolate per week and gradually reduce it.

5. **Stay Active**: Incorporate some physical activity into your routine. It doesn't have to be intense; even a daily walk can help manage cravings and improve your mood.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You've got this!","First off, congrats on reducing your rice portions - that's a real win and shows you can make positive changes. For the chocolate and junk food situation, here's what's worked for many people:

Start by not keeping these foods in your house. It's much easier to say no once at the store than multiple times at home when cravings hit. Replace your current snack stash with healthier alternatives you actually enjoy - maybe fruits, nuts, or dark chocolate if you need that chocolate fix.

When cravings hit hard, try the 10-minute rule. Tell yourself you'll wait just 10 minutes before giving in. Often the urge passes, but if it doesn't, you can make a more conscious choice rather than acting on impulse. During those 10 minutes, do something engaging - take a walk, call someone, or work on a hobby.

For lasting change, track your triggers. Notice what situations or emotions lead to snacking. Are you stressed? Bored? Once you know your patterns, you can develop better responses to those triggers.

Remember this is a gradual process. You've already shown you can change habits with the rice portions. Apply that same patience here - focus on progress, not perfection. Each day you make better choices is a step forward, regardless of any setbacks.","It sounds like you've made some progress with reducing your rice portions, which is great, but now you're facing a new challenge with junk food. One strategy that might help is to identify your triggers - when and where do you usually reach for chocolates or other junk foods? Is it when you're stressed, bored, or around certain people? Once you're aware of your triggers, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms, like going for a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or finding healthier snack options. Additionally, try to make your environment work in your favor - get rid of junk food at home, or avoid walking past the candy aisle at the store. It might also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like cutting back on junk food by one serving per day, and gradually work your way up to making healthier choices. Remember that it's a process and it's okay to take it one step at a time - you've already shown that you can make changes to your eating habits, so let's build on that momentum!","Hey, congrats on reducing your rice portion! That's a solid win. Junk food cravings can be tough, especially when you're already making other changes.

One thing that might help is to figure out *why* you're reaching for the chocolate. Is it boredom? Stress? A reward? Once you know the trigger, you can find healthier substitutes. For example, if it's boredom, try going for a walk or doing something creative. If it's stress, maybe try some deep breathing exercises or listening to music.

Also, don't try to cut everything out at once. That usually backfires. Instead, try swapping out one chocolate bar a day for something else, like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts. Gradually reduce the amount of junk food you're eating each week.

Another thing that works for some people is to make it harder to get the junk food. Don't keep it in the house. If you have to go out of your way to get it, you're less likely to indulge.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're going to slip up sometimes, and that's okay. Just get back on track the next day. It's a marathon, not a sprint. You got this!

t3_u7gixv,[need advice] can’t stop unproductive habits that I don’t even enjoy anymore,"Hello friends

I’ve not looked or posted on here for a long time in fact I don’t think I ever really gave this sub a fair shot. So here I am.

Part of my problem is I didn’t have many good role models growing up so I didn’t really do my homework at school and I was also a social outcast, got bullied a lot, isolated myself to protect myself from feeling pain and trauma from people. I can speak with people, give customer service, but in terms of going where there are people in my free time that’s something I’m resistant to doing and it’s been a problem for years. I’ve not had the best luck I went to a boxing gym years ago and didn’t work out. Went to a meditation group, few weeks later covid happene. Present day I’m no longer convinced I want any part of it after so long. I find it very hard to enjoy most peoples company and I’m not sure they enjoy mine either as my interests are few and a bit odd which makes me doubt it’s worth even trying anymore. 

So now what I had intended to write. I’ve been struggling it’s porn for a good few years, as in when I I use it I feel shit afterwards and the effect lasts for a few days. When I don’t use it for a few weeks or more I feel strong pressure to go back to it which I can’t handle long term. I play computer games and scroll through YouTube and most of time it makes me feel crap and I don’t enjoy it yet I continue with it because doing something that requires attention and learning seems to much effort like it is painful. Today I walked for a good few hours, I practice hrv breathing in the mornings, I meditated for an hour in total I’m guessing today and yet I still end up back on YouTube or playing video games then feeling crap afterward. I read some of a book today also, but it wasn’t an enjoyable experience this time so it put me off reading later in the day or the evening. So does anyone have advice for me mainly about how to stop doing unproductive habits you don’t enjoy doing anymore and a good way to think about trying something that requires more effort than one is use to giving?",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Breaking away from habits that don't serve you anymore can be challenging, but it's definitely possible with some small, consistent changes.

First, try to replace the habits you want to quit with something else that gives you a similar sense of satisfaction or relief. For example, when you feel the urge to watch YouTube or play games, maybe try a quick workout or a short walk instead. It seems like you enjoy walking, so that could be a good alternative.

Also, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Instead of aiming to quit everything at once, focus on reducing the time spent on these activities gradually. You could start by setting a timer for how long you allow yourself to engage in these habits and slowly decrease it over time.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep trying and to celebrate the small victories along the way. Building discipline is a journey, and you're already taking steps in the right direction by seeking advice and trying new things. Keep it up!","Thanks for sharing your situation so openly. The key to breaking free from unfulfilling habits is to make the transition gradual rather than trying to change everything at once. Start by setting a specific time window each day - even just 30 minutes - where you deliberately do something different instead of defaulting to games/YouTube. This could be reading, learning a new skill, or working on a small project.

The resistance you feel toward more demanding activities is totally normal. Our brains are wired to conserve energy and stick to familiar patterns. Instead of fighting this head-on, try the ""5-minute rule"" - commit to just 5 minutes of a more challenging activity. Often you'll find yourself wanting to continue once you get started. If not, that's fine too - you still succeeded by showing up for those 5 minutes.

For the porn habit specifically, check out r/pornfree for specialized support. The key is having alternative activities ready for when urges hit. Your breathing and meditation practice is already a great foundation - maybe add some pushups or other quick exercises when you feel the pressure building.

Consider starting a basic habit tracker where you note how you feel after different activities. Seeing the pattern of feeling worse after certain habits versus better after others can help motivate better choices. You're already doing great with walking, breathing, and meditation - build on that momentum by gradually expanding those positive activities.

Remember that change happens through small, consistent steps rather than dramatic overhauls. Focus on progress rather than perfection, and be patient with yourself as you build new patterns.","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of habitual behaviors and a lack of fulfillment in your daily activities. First, I want to acknowledge that it's great you've been trying out different things like boxing, meditation, and reading - even if they didn't stick, it shows you're willing to experiment and find what works for you. 

One thing that might help with breaking the cycle of unproductive habits is to identify the triggers that lead you to them. For example, do you usually end up on YouTube or playing video games when you're feeling stressed, bored, or avoiding something else? Once you're aware of your triggers, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms. 

It might also be helpful to focus on building small, achievable habits that bring you a sense of accomplishment and joy. You mentioned walking for a few hours and practicing HRV breathing - these are great examples of activities that can give you a sense of pride and fulfillment. Try to build on these small wins by adding more activities that challenge you in a positive way. 

As for trying something new that requires more effort, it might be helpful to start with tiny, manageable steps. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of reading a whole book, try setting a goal to read for just 10-15 minutes a day. Similarly, if you want to get back into meditation or boxing, start with short sessions (even just 5-10 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you build confidence and momentum.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - it's okay to have setbacks, and it doesn't mean you've failed. Just acknowledge the setback, learn from it, and try to do better next time. Remember that building discipline and new habits takes time, patience, and self-compassion. You're taking the first steps by recognizing your patterns and seeking help, so keep moving forward and be kind to yourself along the way.","Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're reaching out and aware of these patterns is a huge first step. It's super common to fall into unproductive habits, especially when you're feeling stressed or down.

Regarding the unproductive habits like porn, gaming, and YouTube, a lot of people find it helpful to replace them with something else, rather than just trying to stop cold turkey. Since you enjoy walking and meditation, maybe try scheduling those for specific times you're most likely to fall into those other habits. Even a short walk or 10 minutes of meditation can break the cycle.

As for the feeling of effort required for more engaging activities, that's totally understandable. Our brains are wired to conserve energy. Try breaking down those bigger tasks into tiny, manageable steps. Instead of aiming to read a whole book, commit to just one page. Instead of a huge learning project, maybe just watch a short tutorial video. The key is to make it so easy you can't say no. Once you get started, you might find it easier to keep going.

Also, don't beat yourself up if you slip up. It happens to everyone. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track. It's a process, not a perfect science. You've got this!

t3_s0iopv,[NEED ADVICE] I exactly know what I want and what I need to do. How to get me to do it every single day until I reach my goals ?,"How to follow a schedule everyday ?

How to be persistent ?

How to do what needs to be done ?",,,"Creating a daily routine and sticking to it can be challenging, but it's definitely doable with some strategic planning. Start by setting clear, achievable goals and break them down into smaller tasks. This makes them less overwhelming and easier to tackle daily. Use a planner or digital calendar to schedule these tasks, and try to stick to the same time each day to build a habit. 

Accountability can also be a game-changer. Share your goals with a friend or join a community where you can check in regularly. This adds a layer of commitment and support. 

Remember, consistency is key, but it's also important to be flexible. Life happens, and sometimes you'll need to adjust your schedule. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day—just get back on track the next day. Lastly, celebrate small wins along the way to keep yourself motivated. You've got this!","Building consistent habits is tough, but it's totally doable with the right approach. Here's what actually works:

Start ridiculously small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire schedule at once, pick ONE important habit and make it tiny. Want to exercise daily? Start with just 5 minutes. Want to study? Begin with 10 minutes. The key is making it so easy you can't say no.

Use habit stacking - attach your new habit to something you already do automatically. If you want to meditate daily, do it right after brushing your teeth. Your existing habit becomes the trigger for the new one.

Track your progress with a simple method like marking Xs on a calendar or using an app like Habitica. Seeing your streak builds momentum and makes you want to keep going. The key is to never miss twice - if you slip up one day, get right back on track the next.

For staying persistent, focus on systems instead of goals. Goals are the destination, but your daily system is what gets you there. Rather than thinking ""I need to lose 20 pounds,"" focus on ""I'm someone who exercises 10 minutes every morning."" The identity change drives lasting habits.

When motivation fails (and it will), rely on making your environment work for you. Want to read more? Keep a book by your bed and remove your phone. Want to eat better? Stock healthy snacks and prep meals ahead. Make the right choices easier and the wrong ones harder.

Remember: discipline isn't about being perfect. It's about being consistent. Start small, stack habits, track progress, focus on systems, and engineer your environment. You've got this.","It sounds like you've got a clear vision of what you want to achieve, which is a huge step forward. To help you stay on track and build persistence, I'd recommend starting small and creating an environment that supports your goals. Begin by breaking down your larger objectives into smaller, manageable tasks that you can tackle daily. Then, schedule these tasks into your daily routine, making sure to set specific times for each activity.

Consistency is key, so try to perform these tasks at the same time every day, even on weekends or days off. It's also important to track your progress, whether it's through a habit tracker, journal, or mobile app. Seeing your progress can be a great motivator and help you stay committed to your goals.

Another strategy is to identify potential obstacles that might derail your routine and come up with contingency plans. For example, if you know you'll be tired in the mornings, prepare everything you need for your first task the night before. Lastly, remind yourself why these goals are important to you and celebrate small wins along the way. It's normal to have off days, but don't let them discourage you - instead, learn from them and get back on track as soon as possible.","Okay, so you know *what* to do, just need help with the *doing* part, right? That's where most people get stuck!

First, schedules are great, but they can be overwhelming. Start small. Pick *one* thing you want to do every day and focus on that. Don't try to overhaul your entire life overnight. Maybe it's just 15 minutes of exercise, or writing one paragraph. Nail that one thing for a week or two before adding another.

For persistence, remember *why* you're doing this. Write down your goals and the reasons behind them. When you're feeling unmotivated, look at that list. Also, don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Just get back on track the next day. Consistency over perfection.

Finally, ""doing what needs to be done"" often comes down to breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. If you're dreading a big project, identify the very first, smallest action you can take and just do that. Often, momentum will carry you forward. Good luck, you got this!

To me this sounds like you've been very hard on yourself for a long time. Maybe early caretakers were hard on you and you learned it from them? Be kind to yourself, and give yourself a hug. Life is hard, and you have a lot on your plate (kids add so much to your daily tasks). You don't owe the world progress or perfection. But you owe yourself kindness. 

Something that helped me a great deal is this book: Taming Your Outer Child by Susan Anderson. It sounds hokey, and the exercises often feel stupid. I don't really buy into all the ideas in that book, but the exercises are compassionate and practical and give you an achievable path forward with an emphasis on building yourself up with kindness. Following the exercises in that book helped me go from bouncing around part-time work, to finally getting my very first full time job at 30. It's not overnight, and it's not linear. I really suggest sticking with it for at least 3 months.

One exercise I think is appropriate for all ages and you can do with your kids! The ""future you"" exercise can be really fun. Draw the you you want to be 5 years from now, you draw them or write them in as much detail as possible. Then, you write down something (one thing) you can accomplish today to bring yourself a little closer to that person. It can be ""go for a walk"" or ""draw for 5 minutes"" or ""write a list"". If you're feeling froggy it can be bigger, but it should be something you can accomplish easily today. Tomorrow (or next month, like it was for me) you can join that art class at the Y, or join a walking group, but today keep it simple. Do another thing tomorrow. 

Finally, please be kind to yourself. Living for your kids is admirable, but you have to live a bit for yourself, too. I'm sure you're children don't see you the way you're saying. Every day is a new day. I promise it will get better.","In my deepest depressions, believing I was a bad mom drove my suicidal ideation the most. Really, it was an expression of my rock bottom low self worth. Believing I was just as bad as my covert narcissistic abusive mother made me totally hopeless. I didn’t know, at the time, that my depression was in fact rooted in childhood trauma and narcissistic abuse. Awakening to this reality helped me see all my self hatred was put in me by narcissists who hate themselves - from my mom to my friends, crushes, bosses. The self loathing is theirs, return to sender. I am increasing self worth and self-differentiation for trauma recovery and healing.","Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's great that you're reaching out for help. First off, remember that wanting to change is a huge first step, and it's clear you care deeply about your kids, which is a powerful motivator.

One thing that might help is starting with small, manageable goals. It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once, so focus on one thing you can improve each day. Maybe it's setting aside 10 minutes for yourself to do something you enjoy or writing down one thing you're grateful for each day. These small actions can slowly shift your mindset and help you build a sense of accomplishment.

Also, consider reaching out to a professional who can provide support and guidance tailored to your situation. Sometimes having someone to talk to can make a big difference.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. You're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward, and remember you're not alone in this.","Hey there. First, you're already doing something incredibly important - staying present and trying your best for your kids. That takes real strength.

The negative self-talk you're experiencing is a habit, and like any habit, it can be changed with consistent effort. Start by catching yourself when these thoughts come up. Instead of fighting them, simply acknowledge ""That's just my old thinking pattern"" and redirect to something constructive.

A practical way to build new mental patterns is through small daily wins. Pick one tiny thing you can do each day - maybe making your bed, or 5 minutes of exercise, or reading one page of a book. When you complete it, pause and really let yourself feel good about it. No dismissing or diminishing the achievement.

Consider starting a ""wins journal"" where you write down 3 things you did well each day, no matter how small. This helps create evidence that counters those ""don't deserve it"" thoughts. Over time, these small successes stack up and create momentum.

Remember that your kids benefit most from seeing you take care of yourself. By working on your own growth, you're teaching them valuable lessons about resilience and self-worth. You deserve good things not because you've earned them, but because you exist. Start small, be consistent, and trust that change is possible.","It takes a lot of courage to admit these feelings, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. It sounds like you're struggling with some deeply ingrained negative self-talk and a sense of unworthiness that's holding you back from making progress in your life. First, let me just say that the fact that you're trying your best for your kids and wanting to be better for them is something to be proud of - it shows that you have a lot of love and capacity for growth.

One thing that might help is to start challenging those negative thoughts by practicing self-compassion. When you catch yourself thinking ""I don't deserve it,"" try to reframe that thought in a more positive and realistic way, like ""I'm doing the best I can as a parent and a person, and that's something to be proud of."" It might also be helpful to focus on small, achievable goals that you can work towards, which can help build your confidence and sense of self-worth.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to do this alone - consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop more positive thought patterns. And in the meantime, try to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to build on. Keep in mind that overcoming these feelings will take time and effort, but it's possible with patience, support, and a willingness to work on yourself.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out and want to change is huge. You're already taking the first step.

It's easy to get stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when you feel like you're not where you want to be. Since you're doing this for your kids, maybe try framing small steps as doing it *with* them. Could you start a simple routine together? Like, every day after dinner, you all spend 15 minutes tidying up, or reading, or even just stretching? It's not about perfection, it's about building momentum and showing yourself (and them) that you *can* make positive changes.

Also, that feeling of not deserving good things? That's a tough one to shake, but it's often based on old beliefs that aren't even true anymore. Maybe try writing down those negative thoughts when they come up, and then challenge them. Ask yourself, ""Is this *really* true? What's the evidence for and against it?""

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're human, and you're going to have setbacks. Don't let those setbacks derail you completely. Just acknowledge them, learn from them, and get back on track. You got this.

t3_ppzo45,[Need Advice] I am in full blown rabbit-in-headlight-panic-mode and I can't do anything,"I am fully aware that I have not been helping myself so maybe this cry for help is just to put it in writing how badly I fucked up but I just don't know what to do right now.

I have been avoiding doing some crucial financial tasks at work for about 3 months because I am scared of what the bills are essentially going to be and I feel like if the outcomes are bad it'll be all my fault (regardless of the fact I was not involved in the bidding of this work in the first place) I don't see a way for them to not be bad right now and of course that's compounded by me just not looking at them and doing my bit in the process. I just can't do it. I am so completely stuck. And I'm getting more and more and more panicky that I can't do any of my usual work tasks, like this whole week at work I've just been able to do some email filing and that's it. I am so overwhelmed by panic I'm just dead in the water.

Of course, my sleep has been almost non-existant, I've stopped going to therapy, I've been drinking (well 7 days clean again but I'm an alcoholic and have recently relapsed and gone back on the wagon) I'm not exercising. I know a large portion of this can be attributed to the fact I lost my mother suddenly 2 months ago, it was a short, unexpected and devasting illness. But to be honest I was feeling very stuck before everything happened with mum and its just worse now, i can't blame everything on that. I'm just stuck in every aspect of my life.

I'm begging for some kind of release/get out of jail free card which I know is impossible. I know nothing anyone can say will be the magic words to fix me or fix the avoidance of work but I just don't know what else I can possibly do apart from walk into traffic to feel better. I'm not actually going to do that, I feel like I'm a failure at that as well but this is how desperate I feel right now.",,,"Hey there, first off, I'm really sorry to hear about your loss. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's okay to feel stuck. Here's a small step you might consider: try breaking down those financial tasks into the smallest possible steps. Maybe just start by opening the documents or making a list of what needs to be done. Sometimes just starting with the tiniest action can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Also, it might be worth reaching out to someone at work who can help or support you with these tasks. You're not alone in this, and asking for help is a strong move. As for therapy, if you can, try to get back into it. It can be a great support system, especially during tough times. Remember, it's okay to take things one day at a time. You're doing your best, and that's enough.","First, take a deep breath. You're dealing with an immense amount right now - the loss of your mother alone is huge, let alone work stress and maintaining sobriety. The fact that you're reaching out and staying sober for 7 days shows incredible strength.

For the immediate work situation: The financial tasks won't get better with time, but you can make them manageable. Start with just 10 minutes. Set a timer, open one document, and just look at it. That's all. When the timer goes off, you can stop. Tomorrow, do 15 minutes. Breaking it into tiny chunks makes it less overwhelming.

Remember - you're not responsible for the initial bidding. Your job now is simply to process the information, not to fix everything. If the numbers are bad, that's valuable information for the company to have. Hiding from them helps no one, including yourself.

Consider going back to therapy - you need support right now, not self-judgment. And while exercise might feel impossible, even a 5-minute walk around the block can help clear your head. Small steps.

Most importantly: You haven't failed. You're going through multiple major life challenges at once. The path forward is through small, manageable actions. Start with one tiny task today. Just one. Then build from there.

If you're having thoughts about self-harm, please reach out to crisis services - they're there specifically for moments like this. You don't have to handle this alone.","It sounds like you're feeling completely overwhelmed and stuck, and it's understandable given everything you've been through lately. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so kudos to you for reaching out and being honest about your situation. 

One thing that might help is to break down the tasks that are causing you anxiety into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of looking at the big picture and feeling overwhelmed, try focusing on one small task at a time. For example, start by just opening the file or document related to the financial tasks you've been avoiding, and then take it from there. You don't have to tackle everything at once.

It's also important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with avoidance and procrastination when faced with difficult or scary tasks. And it's great that you're aware of the patterns that are holding you back, such as your sleep habits, exercise, and therapy. Maybe try to rebuild one of those habits, like going for a short walk or doing some light stretching, to help you feel more grounded and in control.

Lastly, please don't be too hard on yourself, okay? You've been through a traumatic event with the loss of your mom, and it's normal to feel lost and struggling. It might be helpful to reach out to a crisis helpline or a support group for people who are struggling with grief and addiction. They can offer you a safe space to talk through your feelings and get support.

Remember, small steps can add up over time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just focus on getting through the next hour, or the next day, and see how that goes.","Hey, I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time. It sounds incredibly overwhelming, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck. First off, please know that reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness.

Regarding the work situation, is there any way you can break down those financial tasks into smaller, more manageable steps? Instead of tackling the whole thing at once, could you commit to just looking at one bill today? Or spending 15 minutes organizing the documents? Sometimes just starting, no matter how small, can help break the paralysis. Maybe even talk to your supervisor about the anxiety you're experiencing. They might be able to offer support or reassign tasks if possible.

It's also really important to address the other things you mentioned. You've already recognized the importance of therapy, so maybe reaching out to your therapist again is a good first step. Even just one session could provide some coping strategies. And congrats on the 7 days of sobriety! That's a huge accomplishment. Maybe try connecting with a support group, like AA, to help you stay on track.

Losing your mom is a massive trauma, and it's okay to grieve. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself time to heal. Don't expect to bounce back overnight.

Finally, remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate every little victory. You've got this.

t3_w90lop,[Need Advice] I feel terrible over not being productive,"Ever since I (17F) began quarantine in 2020, I have been stuck in this cycle where I just do nothing all day. I just wake up, stay on my phone & do nothing, and then sleep very late at night. 

 And now that summer is almost over, and school is about to begin, all I can only look back now and realized how much time I've wasted...all this free time, and I've accomplished ***nothing***. All it does is just make feel like a giant piece of shit. Here I am sitting on my ass doing nothing, wasting whatever time I could be doing something else...on my fucking phone.  

Every time I do try to set up some goals, and try doing better, for some reason, I just never start. I never actually implement the goals & start doing it. 

Now that college is on the horizon, I feel like it's all over. I feel like I'll never have the free time ever again...

I feel like garbage, I feel guilty for ***wasting*** so much time doing nothing. I literally have nothing to show for my summer except staying inside my house doing nothing. 

I don't know what to do, I just want this to stop. I want to be able to enjoy the things I once did. I want to feel like I actually *want* to complete my goals, rather it be something that keeps me off of youtube & tiktok. I tried blocking apps, I've tried deleting them, but I always just regress back, and I hate myself for it. I have a shitty diet, a shitty sleep schedule, and spend my days doing shit. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong at all or where to even start when trying to stop this. Just any help would be appreciated.","If you don’t forgive yourself for wasting time in the past, all you’ll do is feel shitty about yourself, when you feel shitty about yourself you don’t feel motivated to achieve your goals because you believe you’ll fail before you try.

You cannot change what you did before, only what you’re able to do now. Stop feeling guilty about wasting time, you’re 17 you have a lot of time ahead of you.",,"Hey there! First off, it's totally normal to feel stuck sometimes, especially after such a weird couple of years. The good news is that you can definitely turn things around, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Here are a few steps you might find helpful:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, pick one small habit to change. It could be as simple as setting a consistent bedtime or spending 10 minutes a day on a hobby you enjoy. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. If you want to read more, start with a chapter a day. If you want to exercise, try a 10-minute walk. This makes it easier to start and stick with it.

3. **Limit Phone Time**: Since your phone is a big distraction, try setting specific times when you can use it. You could also try putting it in another room when you need to focus on something else.

4. **Reflect on Your Day**: At the end of each day, jot down one thing you did that you're proud of, no matter how small. This can help shift your focus from what you didn’t do to what you did accomplish.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, everyone struggles with motivation at times. Beating yourself up won't help. Instead, acknowledge that you're trying to make a change and that it's okay to have setbacks.

College will bring new opportunities and routines, so use this time to experiment with what works for you. You've got this!","First off - you haven't ruined anything. You're 17, and you've been dealing with an unprecedented situation during some really important developmental years. Many people, regardless of age, struggled with similar patterns during quarantine.

The good news is that you're aware of what's happening and you want to change. That's honestly the hardest step.

Start small. Really small. Don't try to fix everything at once - pick ONE thing to focus on first. Since you mentioned sleep schedule issues, that's probably the best place to start. Set your alarm for the same time every morning (even weekends) and get up when it goes off. No snoozing, no scrolling. Just get up and start your day.

For the phone addiction - try setting up specific times when you're allowed to use social media. Maybe 30 minutes in the morning and 1 hour in the evening. Use app timers to enforce this. The key is to make it a defined activity rather than a default time-filler.

When you feel the urge to scroll, pause and ask yourself ""what am I avoiding right now?"" Often mindless scrolling is a way to avoid something else - whether it's boredom, anxiety, or a task we don't want to face.

As for college - it's actually going to help you. Structure and schedules make building habits easier, not harder. You'll have classes at specific times, which will naturally help regulate your day.

Remember that discipline isn't about motivation or wanting to do things. It's about doing them anyway, even when you don't feel like it. Start with 5 minutes. Anyone can do anything for 5 minutes. Once you start, you'll often find yourself wanting to continue.

You've got this. The fact that you're asking for help shows you're ready to make changes. Take it one small step at a time.","It sounds like you're really struggling with feeling unproductive and stuck in a rut. First, let's acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to change - that's a huge step. It might be helpful to start small and focus on building one or two new habits at a time, rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine at once. For example, you could try setting a consistent wake-up time and creating a short morning routine that gets you moving and feeling more energized. 

It's also important to remember that you don't have to have it all figured out right now. You're about to start college, and that's a big transition - it's okay if your summer didn't turn out exactly as you hoped. Instead of beating yourself up over what you haven't accomplished, try to focus on what you can control in this moment. What are some small things you can do today or tomorrow to start feeling more productive and engaged? It might be as simple as taking a walk, reading a chapter in a book, or working on a puzzle. 

As for the apps and social media, it might be helpful to try a different approach than just blocking or deleting them. Could you try setting specific times when you allow yourself to check your phone or watch videos, and stick to those times? That way, you're still allowing yourself some downtime and relaxation, but also creating boundaries around it. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and have fun - the goal is to find a balance that works for you, not to deprive yourself of everything you enjoy. 

Lastly, be kind to yourself and try not to dwell on the past. You can't change what's already happened, but you can start making small changes today that will add up over time. You got this, and it's never too late to start building new habits and working towards your goals.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a tough time, but the fact that you're reaching out is a great first step. It's easy to fall into unproductive patterns, especially after something like quarantine. Don't beat yourself up too much about the past; focus on what you can do now.

It sounds like you're trying to make big, sweeping changes all at once, which can be overwhelming. Instead of trying to fix everything immediately, try starting with one small, manageable goal. For example, instead of saying ""I'm going to be productive all day,"" try ""I'm going to read for 20 minutes before I look at my phone in the morning."" Or, ""I'm going to go for a 15 minute walk after lunch."" Small wins build momentum and make bigger changes feel less daunting.

Also, instead of just blocking apps (which you've already found doesn't work long-term), try replacing that time with something you actually enjoy. Remember those things you used to like doing? Even if you don't feel like it at first, force yourself to do it for a little bit. You might be surprised at how quickly you get back into it.

Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to have off days. The important thing is to keep trying and not give up on yourself. College is a fresh start, and you have plenty of time to develop better habits. You got this!

t3_te33ym,"[Need advice] I’m married, late-20s, and am constantly hoping to escape life.","It always boils back to my job too. I am always trying to escape the responsibilities at my job. I’ve never wanted this job, it’s overwhelming with the responsibilities and I feel I can’t manage my time or projects adequately. I have such a hard time focusing and always feel every task is the world collapsing if I don’t get it right or know everything on the spot. It feels like everyone has huge expectations of me and I feel that I cannot fulfill them.

Project management is not my calling and I always want to just be working with my hands or doing something more trade related, but I  fear the decrease in pay. 
I tell myself often that this is a good opportunity that I should hold onto but I just can’t seem to manage it properly and am constantly wishing i could quit and have quite a few thoughts of suicide specifically due to the job… I just lose interest in everything and I like to blame it on this job. There are hobbies that I’m interested in but always feel that my time should be used differently. There’s this feeling that I’m never in the right place or always doing the wrong thing in that moment. 

I’m afraid also that this mind set wouldn’t change if I found another job. That I would just carry it with me for some reason.

Feeling very lost, stressed, and hoping to escape this reality but fear the shame of being a quitter and the pain it would cause my wife.

I need help, but I’m not sure I would truly utilize the help I receive. Who do I go to?",,,"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're in a job that doesn't align with your passions. First off, it's important to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way and that you're not alone. Many people struggle with similar feelings about their careers.

One thing you might consider is gradually exploring your interests in trades or hands-on work. This doesn't mean you have to quit your job immediately, but maybe start by dedicating a small amount of time each week to learning or practicing a skill you're interested in. This can help you feel more fulfilled and give you a clearer idea of whether a career change might be right for you.

In terms of managing your current job, breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Prioritize what's most important and tackle those tasks first. It might also be helpful to communicate with your manager about your workload and see if there's any way to adjust it to be more manageable.

Regarding the fear of carrying this mindset to another job, it might be beneficial to talk to a professional who can help you work through these feelings. Therapy or counseling can provide you with tools to manage stress and build resilience, which can be valuable no matter where you work.

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of talking to your wife about how you're feeling. Having her support can make a big difference, and she might have insights or suggestions that you haven't considered.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and take steps towards a life that feels more aligned with who you are. You're not a quitter for wanting to be happy and fulfilled. Take care of yourself.","First and foremost - please reach out to a mental health professional, especially given the thoughts you're having. Many companies offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that provide free counseling sessions. This isn't about discipline - it's about your wellbeing, and there's absolutely no shame in getting help.

Regarding your job situation - you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed by project management. The constant juggling of tasks and expectations can be incredibly stressful. But before making any drastic changes, consider taking small steps:

Start by breaking down your projects into smaller, manageable chunks. Use a simple project management tool like Trello to visualize your tasks. When everything's laid out, it becomes less overwhelming and easier to tackle one piece at a time.

About the trade work interest - that's worth exploring without immediately quitting your current job. Look into weekend workshops or evening classes in trades that interest you. This gives you a taste of the work while maintaining financial stability. Many successful people transition gradually rather than making sudden jumps.

The feeling that you're never in the right place or doing the right thing sounds exhausting. Instead of fighting these thoughts, try setting aside specific times for both work and hobbies. If you're working, focus on work. If you're enjoying a hobby, give yourself permission to fully engage in it without guilt.

Remember: changing jobs won't automatically fix everything, but addressing the underlying stress and anxiety with professional help can make a huge difference in how you handle any job. You're not a quitter for wanting something different - you're someone who's trying to find their path. That takes courage.

Take the first step - book an appointment with a counselor or therapist. They can help you develop strategies for managing work stress and guide you toward a career path that aligns better with your interests and abilities.","It sounds like you're feeling really trapped and overwhelmed by your job and the expectations that come with it. First, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well, so kudos to you for reaching out. It might be helpful to break down what's specifically causing you stress at your job - is it the project management aspect, the time management, or something else? Sometimes identifying the root cause can help you tackle it more effectively. 

Regarding your desire to switch to a trade-related job, it's understandable that you're hesitant due to the potential pay decrease. However, it might be worth exploring what aspects of trade work appeal to you and whether there are any ways to incorporate those elements into your current life, even if it's just as a hobby or side project.

As for your fear that this mindset would follow you to another job, it's possible that addressing the underlying issues - such as feeling overwhelmed, undervalued, or unfulfilled - could help you develop coping strategies that would benefit you regardless of your profession. 

In terms of seeking help, you might consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop strategies for managing stress and finding fulfillment. You could also try speaking with a career coach or advisor who can help you explore alternative career paths that might be a better fit for you.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and it doesn't mean you're a quitter - it means you're taking proactive steps to improve your life. And as for the shame of quitting, it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around what it means to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. Your wife likely wants you to be happy and fulfilled, and having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns might be a good place to start.","Hey, I hear you. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's brave of you to reach out.

First off, those thoughts of suicide are serious. Please reach out to a suicide prevention hotline or mental health professional immediately. You can find resources online or through your doctor. Your life is valuable, and there are people who want to help you through this.

Now, about the job situation. It sounds like it's really weighing you down. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're in a role that doesn't align with your strengths and interests. The fear of a pay decrease is real, but consider this: is the money worth the cost to your mental health and overall well-being?

Maybe start exploring those trade-related interests on the side. Even dedicating a few hours a week to learning a new skill or working on a small project could give you a sense of accomplishment and direction. It could also help you assess if that career path is truly a better fit.

As for feeling like you'd carry this mindset to another job, that's a valid concern. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or career counselor. They can help you identify any underlying patterns or beliefs that are contributing to your feelings of inadequacy and help you develop coping mechanisms.

Regarding who to go to, start with your mental health. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop strategies for managing stress and improving your overall well-being. Then, consider a career counselor to help you explore alternative career paths and develop a plan for making a change.

Don't be afraid to take small steps. Even just researching different trades or talking to people in those fields can be a start. You don't have to make a drastic change overnight. Focus on finding small ways to improve your situation and take care of yourself. You're not alone in this.

t3_uh7wy2,[Need Advice] No Work Ethic,"I have zero work ethic, I Google and research for answers and no matter what I do, I find myself every week with terrible ethic, I’m 17 year old Male but I’m homeschooled and soon to be in college, I pay my own car insurance and things of the sort. Every week I find myself making excuses to get out of work, to stay home, I’ve been through 3 jobs but am always trying to get out of work in them. I only work 3 days a week at 6 hours a day, I just never feel like going and always find excuses. I got my paycheck last Friday and now it’s Monday and I’ve already blown through it, my paychecks are half as big as they should be due to always skipping, how can I get better work ethic and drive, and a will to go to work and to enjoy it? I don’t want to be lazy. Every time I try to start good habits they last about 3 days and they end there.",,,"Hey there! It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and it's great that you're looking to improve your work ethic. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, focus on one small habit you can stick to. Maybe it's showing up on time for work every day or setting aside a small amount of your paycheck for savings. Small wins can build momentum.

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your work. Is it saving for something specific, gaining experience, or just building a routine? Having a clear purpose can make it easier to push through the days you don't feel like working.

3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and personal projects. Consistency can help make work feel like a natural part of your day rather than a chore.

4. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself something to look forward to after completing your work shifts. It could be a small treat, time to relax, or doing something you enjoy. This can make the workday feel more rewarding.

5. **Reflect on Your Progress**: At the end of each week, take a moment to reflect on what went well and what you can improve. This can help you stay motivated and adjust your approach as needed.

Remember, building discipline takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Keep at it, and you'll likely see improvement over time. Good luck!","Thanks for being honest about wanting to improve. At 17, you're at a great age to start building better work habits that will serve you well in college and beyond.

Let's start small. Instead of trying to transform everything at once, pick ONE specific work-related habit to focus on for the next two weeks. For example, showing up on time for every scheduled shift, no exceptions. When you feel the urge to skip, remind yourself that you're building your future self, not just earning a paycheck.

A practical way to stick with it is to make it harder to bail. Have your work clothes ready the night before. Set multiple alarms. Tell a coworker you'll be there - having someone expect you creates accountability.

For managing money, try immediately setting aside a fixed percentage of each paycheck for essentials like car insurance before you can spend it. You might also track your spending for a week to see where the money's actually going - this often reveals surprising patterns.

The key is to stop thinking of work as optional. Your future self needs you to show up consistently now. Start viewing each shift as a chance to practice being reliable and building your reputation. Those are skills that will matter way more than the actual job itself.

Remember: habits aren't built in 3 days. Give yourself at least 2-3 weeks of consistent effort before expecting it to feel natural. You've already shown initiative by asking for help - now take that same energy and apply it to showing up for your shifts this week.","It sounds like you're really struggling with developing a consistent work ethic, and it's affecting not just your job but also your finances. First, let's acknowledge that recognizing the problem is a huge step, so kudos to you for that. Given your situation, it might be helpful to start small and set achievable goals for yourself. Instead of trying to change everything at once, try committing to showing up to work on time for one week without exceptions. Once you've accomplished that, you can build upon it. 

It's also important to identify the reasons behind your lack of motivation. Is it boredom with your current job, or is there something else going on? Finding a job that you're more interested in or finding ways to make your current job more engaging might help. Additionally, creating a budget and tracking your expenses could help you manage your finances better and see the direct impact of your work ethic on your financial situation.

Since you're homeschooled and soon to be in college, you might also want to explore resources or courses that teach time management, productivity, and goal setting. These skills can be really beneficial in developing a stronger work ethic. Lastly, consider finding an accountability partner, someone who can check in with you regularly and help motivate you to stick to your goals. Remember, developing discipline and a good work ethic takes time and effort, but it's definitely possible with the right mindset and strategies.","Hey man, it sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you *want* to change is huge. A lot of people never even get to that point.

First, about the work thing: 3 jobs already suggests you're looking for something that clicks. Maybe those jobs just weren't a good fit. Think about what you *do* enjoy, even a little bit, and see if you can find work that's closer to that. Even a small connection to your interests can make a big difference.

As for the skipping work and blowing through your paycheck, that's a cycle. You skip work, paycheck is smaller, you feel bad, you spend to feel better, then you're broke and the cycle repeats. To break it, you need small, achievable wins.

Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, focus on ONE thing. Commit to going to work for a full week, no skips. That's it. Just one week. When you get that paycheck, put a small amount (even $10) into a savings account *immediately*. Don't even let yourself see it.

About the habits lasting only 3 days: that's normal! Three days is better than zero. The key is to figure out *why* they're failing. Are you trying to do too much too soon? Scale it back. Make the habit ridiculously easy. Want to exercise? Start with 5 minutes of stretching. Want to read more? Read one page a day. The point is to build momentum and consistency.

Finally, be kind to yourself. You're 17 and figuring things out. It's okay to struggle. Just keep showing up and trying to improve, even if it's just a tiny bit each day. You got this.

t3_t7z46c,[Need Advice] Changing at 30,"Hey all. I hope you’re well today. I’m just looking for motivation and possibly some examples of people who have made drastic changes themselves for the better in their late 20s/30s.

Im 29, I’m in a lot of debt, my addictive habits and insecurities have lead me to lose 5 friends within the span of a year/ made me a bit of a recluse and my current career path is stagnant.
Those are the negatives.

The positives are that I have a workout routine that I am slowly improving upon, my current jobs give me a lot of free time which gives me time to look for new career paths/opportunities to go into. Also my family has a history of mental disorders so for the first time, I’m trying out antidepressants. They’re helping me keep a cool head but I see that they’re not going to change your habits.

I realized too that I have no sense of personal boundaries or sense boundaries for others which has deeply affected my personal relationships.

Is there anyone who has made changes in their life at that age? I understand it’s possible but I would just like to hear from someone.",,,"Hey there! First off, kudos for recognizing where you are and wanting to make a change—that's a huge first step. It's definitely possible to turn things around at 30, and many people have done it. 

One thing that might help is setting small, achievable goals. Since you already have a workout routine, maybe you can use that as a model. Just like you gradually improve your workouts, you can slowly work on other areas, like setting personal boundaries. Start by identifying one or two boundaries you want to establish and practice them in low-stakes situations.

For your career, use that free time to explore what truly interests you. Maybe take some online courses or attend workshops to gain new skills. Networking can also open doors, so consider reaching out to people in fields you're curious about.

Regarding your debt, creating a budget and sticking to it can be a game-changer. There are plenty of resources and apps that can help you track your spending and prioritize debt repayment.

Lastly, it's great that you're addressing your mental health. Therapy, alongside medication, can be really beneficial in understanding and changing habits. Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You've got this!","First off - you're already taking positive steps by working out consistently, seeking treatment, and having the self-awareness to recognize areas for growth. That's huge.

To answer your question directly: Yes, plenty of people make significant changes in their 30s and beyond. I changed careers at 31, went back to school, and rebuilt my social circle from scratch. One of my closest friends turned his finances around at 35 after being in major debt. Another completely transformed his health and relationships in his late 20s after hitting rock bottom.

For the boundary issues you mentioned, start small. Practice saying ""no"" to minor requests that don't align with your goals. When someone crosses a line, calmly state your position: ""I'm not comfortable with that"" or ""That doesn't work for me."" It feels awkward at first but gets easier with practice.

For the debt situation, check out r/personalfinance for solid advice on creating a debt payoff strategy. Many people there have overcome similar situations.

The key is to focus on one or two changes at a time rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. Pick the areas that will have the biggest positive impact on your life and start there. Maybe that's getting your finances in order, or rebuilding key relationships, or exploring new career paths.

You're at a perfect age to make changes - young enough to have plenty of time ahead, but with enough life experience to know what you really want. Keep building on those positive changes you've already started, and take it one day at a time.","It's great that you're recognizing the areas in your life that need improvement and are taking steps towards change, especially with your workout routine and seeking help for your mental health. Those are huge accomplishments, and it's awesome that the antidepressants are helping you feel more grounded. 

As for making drastic changes in your late 20s/30s, there are plenty of examples out there. One that comes to mind is J.K. Rowling, who was a single mom living on welfare at 32, but went on to become one of the most successful authors in the world. Closer to home, I've seen people in this community share their own stories of turning their lives around in their 30s, whether it's paying off debt, switching careers, or overcoming addiction.

It sounds like you're aware of the importance of setting personal boundaries, which is a great starting point. You might find it helpful to explore books or resources on boundary-setting, such as ""Boundaries"" by Henry Cloud and John Townsend. Additionally, since you have a lot of free time, you could use that to your advantage by dedicating a few hours each week to learning new skills or exploring different career paths.

Remember that change is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have everything figured out right now. Just focus on making progress, and celebrate your small wins along the way. You got this, and you're not alone in this journey.","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot, but also that you're taking some really important steps to improve things. Recognizing the issues is half the battle, and you've already identified key areas like debt, habits, relationships, and career.

It's definitely possible to make big changes at 29 (or any age, really!). The key is breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. You've got the workout routine going, which is awesome. Maybe focus on one other area at a time.

For example, with debt, could you start by tracking your spending for a week or two to see where your money is going? Then, look for small ways to cut back. Even an extra $20 a week towards debt can make a difference over time.

Regarding habits and boundaries, maybe pick one habit you want to change and focus on replacing it with something healthier. And for boundaries, start small. Practice saying ""no"" to something low-stakes. It gets easier with practice. There are some great books on boundaries too, if you're interested.

Career-wise, use that free time to explore different options. Network, take online courses, or even just research different fields. Small steps each day can lead to big changes down the road.

The antidepressants are a great tool, but you're right, they won't magically change habits. Think of them as helping you get to a place where you *can* work on those habits more effectively.

You've got this. Focus on small, consistent progress, and don't be afraid to ask for help along the way. You're already doing the hard work of self-reflection and taking action.

t3_p7oimu,[need advice] how to stop comfort eating?,"hi, sorry for poor formatting as I’m currently on mobile and in a state of distress. im also not 100% sure this is the subreddit for this, but im giving it a shot

im 17 years old and i am obese. i have been almost my entire life. growing up, my father was incredibly abusive, and i would see my mother turn to food for comfort. chips, soda, pizza, takeout, you name it. 

eventually my mother worked up the courage to leave, but the habits remained. and i piggybacked off of them. this would be at approximately 13 years old when he left, and i was nearing 245 pounds (i am a taller girl, currently 6’1) and i was constantly bullied as well for my size, which fueled my poor habits. my mother didnt know how to comfort me, so when i would come home crying, she enabled me by taking me out for ice cream to comfort me. i know she meant well, but its a habit i cant break. 

with the pandemic, ive gained a SHITLOAD of weight. there are stressors as well contributing to that. my grandmother is battling cancer, my stepdad lost his job, and i find with my license ive recently acquired, i can easily go to shops and pick something up that i dont need. i want to change. i want to be healthy, i dont want to be fat my entire life. i want to enjoy my life without heaving after a flight of stairs. 

but i dont know how. so this is my last resort at this point. my mother is no help, god bless her. i am begging for some sort of advice or personal experiences relating to mine in some way.

i apologize if this is long winded. i am incredibly desperate, and wanted to add some backstory to get the situation clear.",,,"Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for help—recognizing the need for change is a huge first step. Comfort eating is tough to tackle, especially when it's been a coping mechanism for so long. Here are a few ideas that might help:

1. **Start Small**: Try to make one small change at a time. Maybe swap out one unhealthy snack for a healthier option you enjoy. Over time, these small changes can add up.

2. **Find Alternatives**: When you feel the urge to comfort eat, try to find another activity that can help you de-stress. This could be going for a walk, listening to music, or even journaling your thoughts.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to what you're eating and why. Are you actually hungry, or is it more about emotions? This awareness can help you make more conscious choices.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Instead of focusing on losing a certain amount of weight, aim for goals like being able to walk a certain distance without getting winded. These can be more motivating and rewarding.

5. **Seek Support**: It might be helpful to talk to a counselor or join a support group. Having someone to talk to about your struggles can make a big difference.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!","First off - you're incredibly self-aware for 17, and recognizing these patterns is a huge first step. Breaking the comfort eating cycle is tough, but absolutely doable with the right approach.

Start by keeping a simple food journal - not to count calories, but to track when and why you're eating. Write down your emotions and what triggered the urge to eat. This helps identify your specific comfort-eating patterns.

Replace the comfort-food routine with alternative coping mechanisms. When stress hits, try going for a walk, calling a friend, drawing, or any activity that keeps your hands busy. The key is having these alternatives ready before the urge strikes.

For the driving situation - leave your wallet at home when you're not specifically planning to buy something. It creates a barrier between impulse and action. Also, try keeping your car stocked with water and healthy snacks for emergencies.

Make changes gradually. Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Maybe start by swapping one comfort food situation per week with a healthier alternative. Small wins build momentum.

Consider joining some online communities focused on healthy living - there are lots of supportive spaces for teens working on similar goals. Having people who understand what you're going through makes a huge difference.

Remember that slip-ups are normal and don't erase your progress. The goal isn't perfection - it's building better habits over time. You've already shown incredible strength by reaching out for help. Take it one day at a time, and be proud of each small step forward.","Hey, thanks for sharing your story with us - it takes a lot of courage to be so open about something as personal as this. First off, let's acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the patterns that have led to comfort eating. It's clear that food has been used as a coping mechanism for emotional pain in your family, and breaking that habit won't be easy, but it's definitely possible.

One thing that might help is to identify your triggers - when do you usually reach for comfort foods? Is it when you're stressed about your grandmother's health, or when you're feeling overwhelmed with school or other responsibilities? Once you know what your triggers are, you can start working on alternative coping mechanisms. For example, if you're feeling anxious, could you try going for a short walk, practicing some deep breathing exercises, or talking to a friend instead of reaching for food?

It might also be helpful to find healthy ways to comfort yourself that don't involve food. This could be something as simple as taking a warm bath, listening to music, or doing some light stretching. And when you do feel like you need to eat, try to make healthier choices - instead of going for ice cream, could you have a piece of fruit or some cut veggies with hummus?

It's also important to remember that you don't have to do this alone. While your mom might not be able to offer the support you need right now, there are other resources available to you. You could consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the emotional stuff that's contributing to your comfort eating. And there are plenty of online communities and forums (like this one!) where you can connect with others who are going through similar struggles.

Lastly, be kind to yourself, okay? You're not going to break the habit of comfort eating overnight, and it's okay to slip up sometimes. The important thing is that you're recognizing the problem and wanting to make a change. That's a huge step, and it's something to be proud of. Keep moving forward, even if it's just in small increments - you got this!","Hey, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now, and it's awesome that you're recognizing the need for change and reaching out. That's a huge first step.

First off, be kind to yourself. You've been using food as a coping mechanism for understandable reasons. It's not about blaming yourself, but about finding healthier ways to cope.

Since you have your license now, maybe try using that freedom to explore healthier options. Instead of driving to get fast food, could you drive to a park and go for a walk? Or to a library to find some healthy recipes? Small swaps can make a difference.

It might also help to identify your triggers. When do you usually crave comfort food? Is it when you're stressed about your grandma, or when you're bored? Once you know your triggers, you can plan ahead. For example, if you know you crave ice cream after school, maybe pack a healthy snack to eat on the drive home.

Also, don't try to overhaul everything at once. Start with one or two small changes. Maybe aim to drink more water each day, or to add a serving of vegetables to one meal. As you get comfortable with those changes, you can add more.

Consider finding a therapist or counselor to help you process the trauma from your childhood and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It's a tough journey to go on alone, and having professional support can make a huge difference. There are also resources online and in your community that offer support groups for people struggling with emotional eating. You're not alone in this. Good luck, you've got this!

t3_10hhpmg,[Need advice] How do you do it for yourself?,"“It” can be a lot of things for example: how do you workout for yourself? For a true desire to be healthy for YOURSELF, not because you want to look good for so-and-so, not because you want to look a certain way so others won’t see you as unhealthy or overweight, not for anyone. Only your own health and personal gains. 

I feel like I’ve always done things for praise from others or to look good to others. Won a trophy? Lots of congratulations from peers. Look skinny? People will be attracted to you and you will be more likely to be accepted. Get an A+ on a paper? Parents will say good job. 

I have only done things for the reactions of people not for me. I think what I’m asking is how do you get the internal drive to want to do things for yourself and your own personal gain.","One important aspect is that you need to think long and hard about what your own core values are - what do you think is truly important, in and of itself? Withou

Everyone has a different set of things that really speak to them on a gut level. It might be ""a dedicated work ethic,"" or ""being a dependable friend,"" or ""educating yourself,"" or ""going outside my comfort zone,"" or ""showing kindness,"" or any number of things. There's no right or wrong answer - but there are certain things that speak to you on a deep, foundational level.

When you consciously decide to engage in behaviors that are in alignment with your own core values, then you will increase the likelihood of intrinsic motivation - because you will respect the implicit value of your own efforts.",,"Finding that internal drive can be tough, but it's definitely possible with some self-reflection and small steps. Start by identifying what truly matters to you. What are your values and passions? Once you have a clearer picture, set small, personal goals that align with these values. For example, if health is important to you, focus on how exercising makes you feel more energetic or improves your mood, rather than how it makes you look. 

Try to shift your mindset from external validation to internal satisfaction. Celebrate small wins privately and notice how they make you feel. Journaling can help track your progress and reflect on your motivations. Over time, as you see the benefits of doing things for yourself, your internal drive will grow stronger. Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","This is a really important realization you've come to. External validation can be a powerful motivator, but it's ultimately unreliable and doesn't lead to lasting change. Here's what helped me shift from external to internal motivation:

Start by getting clear on your personal values. Not what others value, but what YOU genuinely care about. Health might mean having energy to pursue your passions, or being strong enough to be self-reliant as you age. Academic success might mean satisfying your curiosity or developing expertise in topics that fascinate you.

Then, start tracking metrics that matter to you personally. Instead of focusing on compliments about your appearance, track how many pushups you can do or how far you can run. Rather than counting likes on social media, keep a private journal of your daily wins and progress.

Make it a habit to pause and notice how activities make you feel in the moment. After exercising, take 30 seconds to appreciate the endorphins and sense of accomplishment. When learning something new, savor those ""aha!"" moments of understanding.

The shift doesn't happen overnight. It's okay to still enjoy external praise - just don't let it be your primary driver. Over time, you'll start craving that feeling of personal progress and satisfaction that comes from within. That's when discipline becomes sustainable, because you're doing it for the most important person: yourself.","I think this is a really insightful question, and it takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize that you've been motivated by external validation for so long. For me, developing an internal drive has been about slowly shifting my focus away from what others think and towards how I feel when I achieve something. It's about asking myself, ""What do I want to get out of this?"" or ""How will this make me feel?"" instead of ""What will others think of me?""

It might be helpful to start small by setting personal goals that have nothing to do with external validation. For example, you could try working out just because it makes you feel good, or learning a new skill just because you're interested in it. As you achieve these small goals, pay attention to how they make you feel, and use that as motivation to keep going. It's also important to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and not be perfect - you're doing things for yourself, not for anyone else's approval.

Another thing that might help is to identify what your core values are, and what kind of person you want to be. When you're motivated by external validation, it can be easy to lose sight of what's truly important to you. By getting clear on your values and goals, you can start to develop a sense of purpose and direction that comes from within, rather than from outside sources.","Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough to untangle external validation from your own motivations. A few things that have helped me:

First, try reframing your goals. Instead of ""I want to lose weight,"" think ""I want to feel more energetic and capable."" Focus on the *feeling* you're chasing, not the external result. How would being healthier *feel* in your day-to-day life? More energy? Less pain? Better sleep? Keep that feeling in mind.

Second, start ridiculously small. Seriously. If you want to work out, don't aim for an hour at the gym. Aim for 5 minutes of stretching or a 10-minute walk. The point is to build momentum and prove to yourself that you *can* do it. Small wins build confidence and intrinsic motivation.

Third, track your progress, but focus on the process, not just the outcome. Did you stick to your 5 minutes of stretching every day this week? Awesome! That's a win, regardless of whether you see immediate physical changes. Celebrate the consistency.

Finally, be patient and kind to yourself. It takes time to rewire your brain and build new habits. There will be days when you slip up. That's okay. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track the next day. The key is consistency over perfection. You got this!
