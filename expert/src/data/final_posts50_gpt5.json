      "body": "I really feel like a complete failure. I Can’t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I’m not as productive as I’d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I’m just so disappointed in my self. It’s hard to drink water. I’m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I’m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I’m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I’m just mad at life. I’m not depressed I’m just disappointed. \n\nI’m a ball full of energy. I’m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I’m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I’m a caffeine addict. I don’t know how I will function without my meds when I’m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven’t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don’t wanna do. I’m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don’t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can’t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I’m\nTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what's wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\n\nThat's how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Main thing you need to focus on is getting rid of caffeine.  Your body becomes extremely dependent on it.  That’s why you feel like you have no energy.  It’s hard to cut caffeine addiction but trust me it’s worth it.",
        "comment_o3": "I’ve been in a similar loop with ADHD meds, caffeine, lousy food, and guilt, so here’s what’s actually helped me crawl out of the spiral and get some real traction.\n\nTreat the medicated and un‑medicated days as two different “modes” with their own expectations. On Vyvanse days aim for the heavy cognitive stuff (studying, trading practice, paperwork) and block it in short “work sprints”—25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes off, three rounds, then a longer break. Put just three must‑do items on the schedule; finishing them earns you a win, everything else is extra credit. On off‑days switch the goal to recovery and low‑bandwidth habits: meal‑prep, laundry, a walk, stretching, refilling your water bottle every time you open the fridge. When the bar is realistic you stop burning willpower on beating yourself up.\n\nFood: decide it once, not three times a day. Sunday evening plan five simple, repeatable meals you don’t hate (e.g., overnight oats, rotisserie‑chicken salad kits, frozen veg + rice + sauce). Prep or portion them right away so “what should I eat?” never becomes a question. Store junk food somewhere you’d have to leave the house to get—future‑you rarely wants to put on shoes just for Oreos. For water, tie it to something you already do: every bathroom break = 8 oz, every coffee = finish a full bottle first. If plain water is painful, add zero‑calorie flavor drops or go bubbly.\n\nMovement: 10‑minute micro‑workouts beat zero‑minute perfect workouts. Bodyweight circuits, YouTube yoga, or a brisk walk around the block keep the streak alive on lethargic days and blunt the urge to binge. Momentum matters more than intensity.\n\nPhones and dopamine: put your most distracting apps in a folder called “Later” on the last screen, turn on grayscale after 9 p.m., and leave the charger across the room so grabbing the phone is an active choice. When the itch hits, set a 10‑minute timer—if you still want to scroll after it rings, go ahead; half the time the urge passes.\n\nPlan for the inevitable crash days: write a short rescue checklist (“drink water, shower, 10‑min walk, text a friend”) and tape it where you’ll see it first thing. Following it keeps a bad day from becoming a bad week.\n\nFinally, don’t confuse discipline with punishment. You’re not broken; your brain just needs clearer systems than most people’s. Nail one small ritual at a time, celebrate it, then stack the next one on top. Six months of that beats any heroic Monday‑morning overhaul. You already care enough to ask for help—that’s the hardest part. Now give yourself permission to improve in boring, unsexy, relentlessly consistent steps. It works.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not broken. You’re trying to run a high-friction life on raw willpower. ADHD + BED means you need systems that remove friction and stabilize your energy, not heroic motivation.\n\nFirst, the meds. Two-day “holidays” can cause rebound appetite, lethargy, and binges. If you’re on Vyvanse partly for BED, those off-days are likely pouring gasoline on the problem. Ask your prescriber if breaks are actually necessary, and if not, try consistent dosing and timing. If you do keep off-days, give them a specific playbook so they don’t turn into chaos.\n\nCreate two modes: on-med days = deep work days, off-med days = maintenance days. On-med: one or two 45–60 min focus blocks for the hardest stuff (trading study, school), then anything extra is a bonus. Off-med: errands, laundry, meal prep, light workouts, admin. Stop holding both days to the same standard.\n\nGive yourself a Minimum Viable Day that happens no matter what: 10 minutes of movement, 1 liter of water before noon, 3 structured meals. That’s it. If you do more, great, but the MVD keeps you from spiraling. Discipline is mostly keeping your minimums.\n\nFor binge eating, stop the restrict–binge cycle. Even if Vyvanse blunts appetite, still eat regular meals. Set predictable times: breakfast within 60–90 minutes of waking, lunch, dinner, plus 1–2 planned snacks. Build each meal around protein, fiber, and volume: example breakfast could be Greek yogurt with berries and granola; lunch could be a protein wrap with veggies and an apple; dinner a lean protein, a big pile of veggies, and a carb you enjoy. Pre-decide tomorrow’s meals the night before to reduce decision fatigue. Keep trigger foods out of the house or buy them in single-serve portions. When an urge hits, delay 10 minutes, drink water or tea, change rooms, and set a timer; most urges crest and pass. If a binge happens, the very next meal is normal and boring; no “make up for it” restriction.\n\nHydration: make it stupid-easy. Fill a large bottle at night and put it where you’ll see it in the morning. Drink 10 big sips before coffee. Use a zero-sugar electrolyte if plain water is hard. Aim for finishing one bottle by noon and another by dinner. Every time you pee, take 5–10 sips. That habit stack works.\n\nMovement and energy: off-med days don’t have to be gym days. Do a 10–20 minute walk outside right after waking. Light exposure + movement will do more for energy and appetite regulation than another coffee. If you can, add a super simple strength routine three times a week: 2 sets each of squats, pushups (incline if needed), hip hinges, and rows. Keep it under 20 minutes so you don’t negotiate with yourself.\n\nPhone dopamine: make distraction physically inconvenient. Put your phone on grayscale, move social apps to a folder on the last page, and set app limits. During focus blocks, leave the phone in another room and use Do Not Disturb. Keep a scratch pad beside you; when a thought pops up, write it down and return to the task. That tiny move saves a ton of tab-hopping.\n\nFocus system: use the 5-minute rule. Tell yourself you’ll start for five minutes; momentum usually carries you. Try 25/5 or 45/10 timers. Body doubling is gold for ADHD—study in a library, sit with a friend, or use Focusmate/lofi coworking streams. For trading, make it concrete: “From 10:00–10:45 I read chapter X and take notes; 10:45–11:00 I practice one setup and log it.” Open-ended “learn trading” is a trap.\n\nSleep and caffeine: consistency beats perfection. Same wake time daily, even weekends. Limit caffeine after noon to protect sleep. If you’re a heavy user, taper slowly over a week or two instead of trying to quit overnight; swap some cups for tea or half-caf. Better sleep will help cravings and focus more than another stimulant.\n\nEnvironment > willpower. Set out breakfast dishes and fill your water the night before. Prep protein and easy veggies on Sundays. Put running shoes by the door. Hide the junk food; put fruit in sight. What’s visible gets done.\n\nWhen you fall off, use the two-day rule: never miss twice. If Monday was a wash, Tuesday is an MVD day and you’re back on track. Review your week every Sunday for 10 minutes: what worked, what snagged you, what tiny tweak for next week. Iterate; don’t overhaul.\n\nIf you can, get a therapist or dietitian who treats BED (CBT-E/DBT). The goal isn’t to be perfect; it’s to make binges less frequent, less intense, and shorter—and to keep moving forward in between.\n\nYou asked how to “rewire your brain.” This is it. Regular meals and sleep stabilize your biology. Tiny consistent wins retrain your attention. Environment shifts make the good choice the default. Your identity follows your actions. Start with the MVD and one focus block a day. Seven straight days of that will feel different than what you’re doing now.\n\nYou’ve got a lot going for you. Point it with a simple system and let boring consistency do the heavy lifting."

My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines . At times I feel like I'm crazy cause I can be somewhat miserable on more than one occasion and can't interact very well with other people. People are fed up for good reason. I dont have a life",

        "percentile_10_comment": "It is never too late to start as long as you move in the right direction. A 10 or 100 small steps in the right direction  will still be 10 or 100 steps better then where you were before.\n\nHaving said that, make a list of things or goals in major areas of your life physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually. Break these into  20 small actionable steps.\n\nE.g Physical goal: Want to get fit? Get up an hour early. Go for a walk, excercise or jog everyday for 30 minutes. Avoid junk food. Eat healthy. If you can do this for a month consistently, you would have done 15 hours of exercise and had an improved diet. Over a long term these add up and count.\n\nList down similarly what you can do. In terms if finances, try getting a job. Create a resume. Update it to all job portals. Look an hour for all jobs available and apply. Ask friends for job openings.... you will land something.\n\nTry going to mall or retail outlets and look for or ask for job. \n\nEveryday have a sense of accomplishment. Try saving one dollar a day, and put it in a jar where it is visible to you....\n\nJoin a library and read 2-3 pages of a book you like.\n\nListen to uplifting music.\n\nAvoid wasting time.\n\nCut negative thinking and be friends and supportive to your self. \n\nEveryday try to encourage yourself and do better and be in a better place than yesterday.

        "comment_o3": "You’re actually sitting on some decent raw materials: decent health, some savings, living parents you still talk to, and a clear sense that what you’re doing now isn’t working. That’s enough to start making deliberate moves instead of drifting. Try treating the next twelve months like a personal turnaround plan with three pillars—income, structure, and community.\n\nIncome first. Turn job‑hunting into a daily habit, not a mood‑based activity. Pick a set time each weekday (say 9‑11am) where the phone goes on airplane mode and you do one thing that moves the ball: tweak the résumé, send applications, follow up on an old lead, or take an online micro‑course that upgrades a line on your CV. Track it on paper so you can literally see the streak build. Momentum here will reduce a lot of the background anxiety you’ve got about the future.\n\nStructure next. You already work out; expand that into a simple morning routine that starts the day on rails: wake at the same time, drink water, make the bed, 15‑minute walk, then your workout. Lay clothes out the night before so there’s zero decision fatigue. When the routine becomes automatic you free up willpower for bigger goals.\n\nCommunity last, but crucial. Isolation makes everything else harder. The fastest, cheapest way to get around people who won’t ghost you is volunteering. Animal shelters, food banks, park cleanups—pick something that takes two or three hours a week. You’ll add structure, meet people who value contribution over social polish, and you may stumble into job leads. If you enjoy fitness, consider a group class or even studying for a personal‑trainer cert; that turns an existing interest into a social and possibly paid activity.\n\nExpect awkwardness at first. Do it anyway, log it, and see how you feel after thirty days. If emotions stay rough, add a therapist to the mix; savings are well spent on getting your mind running clean.\n\nThe short version: one disciplined job‑search block a day, one locked‑in morning routine, one weekly commitment that puts you around other humans. Keep those promises to yourself for a quarter and your life will look noticeably different—maybe not “fixed,” but moving, and that’s what counts. Good luck, man; twelve months of consistent basics can erase a lot of messy years.",
        "comment_gpt5": "31 isn’t old and you’re not starting from zero. You’ve got two real footholds: you’re already in decent shape and you’ve got some savings. Use those to build structure, income, and a few reliable connections. Think 90‑day reset focused on boring, repeatable basics.\n\nSet a fixed wake time and protect it for 30 days. Put your phone to charge outside the bedroom, alarm across the room. As soon as you’re up, take a 10–20 minute walk outside and get light in your eyes. That one habit will help mood, sleep, and consistency. Keep lifting, but make the walk non‑negotiable even on rest days.\n\nGive yourself a daily work block before noon, no matter what: 2–4 hours, timer on, no doom‑scrolling. Split it between job search and skill. Track applications in a simple spreadsheet and set a weekly target (e.g., 50 tailored applications or outreach messages, with daily follow‑ups). If you need cash and momentum quickly, commit to landing any paycheck within two weeks: cafe, warehouse, delivery, or front desk at a gym. Structure > perfect job right now. In parallel, pick one marketable skill to level up 60 minutes a day (Excel, CPR/first aid if you want to work in fitness, customer service scripts, basic sales). Small daily progress compounds.\n\nLeverage fitness to make a difference and meet people. Offer two free beginner sessions a week at a local park and invite others. Post a simple flyer on community boards and in local Facebook/Nextdoor groups. Ask attendees for a testimonial and referrals. Or apply to front‑desk/assistant roles at nearby gyms; it puts you around people, builds a network, and can lead to training clients.\n\nBuild social reps, not instant friendships. Aim to talk to three humans a day, even tiny interactions. Pick one recurring group where people show up weekly—volunteer shift at a food bank, animal shelter, run club, Toastmasters, church/community cleanups—and commit to 8 straight weeks. Say, “Hey, I’m [Name]. I’m new here.” That’s enough. Text your parents twice a week with a short update; consistency matters more than depth.\n\nCreate a simple night shutdown: 15‑minute tidy, lay out clothes, set tomorrow’s top 3 tasks on an index card, and write a 3‑line journal (what I did, what I’ll do tomorrow, one thing I’m grateful for). Aim for 7–8 hours of sleep. Cut back on numbing habits that wreck momentum (binge scrolling, booze, porn). If dating causes chaos, take a 60‑day break while you stabilize.\n\nUse a wall calendar and put an X for each day you hit the basics: wake on time, walk, work block, one social rep, shutdown. Don’t break the chain. When you miss, don’t spiral—just don’t miss twice.\n\nYou don’t need to “fix your life” all at once. You need a boring day that you repeat: wake, walk, work, lift, one human interaction, shutdown. Do that for 90 days and you’ll have income, a couple of steady contacts, better mood, and real momentum. Start tomorrow by setting your wake time, booking one volunteer shift, and applying to five jobs before noon. Then go for the walk."

        "comment_o3": "You’re not dealing with laziness, you’re dealing with fear masquerading as “I’ll do it later.” That fear shrinks when the next move is tiny and time‑boxed. Set a 25‑minute timer, pick one specific chunk (one concept, 10 questions, whatever), and do absolutely nothing else until time’s up. Stand, stretch five minutes, repeat. Six of those blocks is only 3 hours but it’s real, focused work. You’ll feel momentum after the first one, so make it the day’s first task before breakfast.\n\nMake failure harder than studying. Delete dating apps, install a blocker like Cold Turkey that locks porn and social media during your study windows, and hand the password to a friend or sibling until test day. Put your phone in another room; no one needs “just a quick scroll” during a 25‑minute sprint.\n\nFront‑load your schedule. Willpower fades, so carve out your biggest study session early.

You don’t need to fix everything—just set up the next 30 days like a sprint with fewer decisions and fewer doors to run through.\n\nTonight, make a one-page plan. List the exact topics you still need to cover. Pick the number of full-length practice tests you’ll do (e.g., one per week, then review every mistake like it’s gold). Block your days into focused sessions (50 minutes on, 10 off, repeat 4–6 times). Decide your study location and time you start each day. Lay out tomorrow’s first task so you can sit and hit “start” without thinking.\n\nCut friction and block temptations, hard. Delete dating apps, log out of socials, and install site/app blockers (Cold Turkey, Freedom, LeechBlock, BlockSite). Put your phone in another room or a lockbox during blocks. Use Focusmate or a library so you can’t tab out as easily. This isn’t forever—just for a month.\n\nUse if-then rules so you don’t negotiate with yourself. If I catch myself browsing, I stand up, get water, and restart the timer. If I feel the porn urge, I leave the room for two minutes, walk, breathe, and restart. If I start fantasizing, I write the thought on paper and park it for after the session. Keep a notepad for intrusive thoughts so you don’t chase them.\n\nMake the start trivial and momentum will do the rest. Commit to five minutes. Open the book, write the first problem, start the timer. Most sessions extend once you’ve begun. Your only job is to start the next block.\n\nShift from outcome goals to process goals for this month. Winning the day = number of focused blocks completed + review of mistakes, not how you “feel” about it. Track blocks and streaks on paper where you can see them. Reward yourself only after blocks, not before.\n\nSimulate the exam. Do a timed, distraction-free practice each week at the same time of day as the real one. Review every error and write a one-sentence fix per mistake. This directly reduces fear, because your brain sees evidence you can handle the test.\n\nProtect your basics so your brain can focus. Same wake time daily, real meals, a 20-minute walk, and cut caffeine after midday. Prep your desk the night before. Put the first two hours after waking on airplane mode and use them for your heaviest work.\n\nReduce the “doom fog” by writing out the worst-case and your response plan once. If X happens, I will do Y. Once your brain knows there’s a plan, it’s easier to get back to work. Then don’t revisit it—just run the plan.\n\nCreate external accountability. Tell a friend you’ll send a photo of completed blocks each night, or post a daily check-in on this sub. Put a small monetary commitment on the line with a friend or a site like stickK.\n\nYour situation isn’t special in a bad way—it’s classic high-pressure avoidance, and it’s beatable with boring structure. Start with one clean day. Tonight: plan. Tomorrow morning: first 50 minutes, timer on, no phone. Then just stack blocks. Come back and update after Day 1. You’ve got a month. Use it."

Tie each reward to a specific action (e.g., “When I finish my workout, I get my latte”) and cash it in immediately after the task so your brain links success with the treat. Keep the size of the reward proportional to the task: small goal, small reward; big milestone, bigger reward like a night out or new gear related to your habit.

        "comment_gpt5": "Great question. The trick is to make rewards immediate, small, and aligned with the person you’re trying to become—so they reinforce the habit instead of undoing it.\n\nUse three layers. First, an instant “micro-reward” right after you finish: quick checkmark on a tracker, a one-sentence win log (“Kept a promise to myself”), a 2–5 minute break you look forward to like a stretch, a short walk in sunlight, a fancy coffee/tea, or one song you only play after completing the task. Make it automatic and tiny so you don’t derail momentum.\n\nSecond, a session reward you can cash in at the end of the day if you did the thing: 20–30 minutes of a show, guilt-free gaming, reading, or a hobby. Set a timer so it stays a treat, not a new rabbit hole.\n\nThird, milestone rewards that make the habit easier or celebrate progress without backsliding: after 10 sessions, upgrade gear, buy a helpful book/app, plan a fun outing, or move $5–$10 per session into a “fun fund” and spend it at 10–20 sessions. This ties consistency to something tangible.\n\nA few guardrails: don’t use the behavior you’re trying to cut as the reward (junk food for a diet, endless scrolling after deep work). Timebox rewards. Keep the reward separate from the task so you don’t start bargaining (“If I do extra, I get extra”). And occasionally throw in a surprise bonus reward to keep it fresh—variable reinforcement helps.\n\nIf you do nothing else, track it and give yourself a 10-second celebration ritual. That tiny hit of “I did it” is often enough to make tomorrow easier. The best reward is the one you’ll actually use that keeps you showing up again."

      "body": "When I (30s M) have feelings, whether it be love, betrayal, happiness, sadness, etc, I feel it deeply, to the point my emotions affect my thought and decision making processes. My emotional response to what would be the logical actions to take prevents me from making what deep down I know would probably be the best decision, but my feelings and emotions focus on the hope of what I desire, instead of looking at the reality of what I actually receive. Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.",

        "best_comment": "I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nGood luck!",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Try journalling. Write or talk to someone about it, don't suppress it, it will just bottle up and that's not good. Writing things helps me see it as it is and not with emotions but with logic and rationale.",
        "comment_o3": "I used to think the answer was to shut feelings down, but that’s like trying to hold a beach ball underwater—it works until it doesn’t. The trick is separating the moment you feel an emotion from the moment you act on it. One simple way is the “pause and label” habit: when something hits you, name the emotion out loud or in writing (“that’s anger,” “that’s disappointment”). The tiny act of labeling moves the experience from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, giving you a short window to think instead of react.\n\nWhile you’re in that window, run a preset protocol rather than ad‑libbing. Mine is a notebook page with three questions: What exactly happened? What do I want to do right now? What would I tell a friend to do? Writing it forces me to translate raw feelings into concrete statements, and looking at that third answer often exposes the gap between impulse and wisdom. If I’m still unsure, I wait 24 hours before taking any irreversible action—love confessions, angry emails, quitting a job, whatever. Most emotional whiplash cools off in a day; if it still feels right after the wait, I trust it more.\n\nBuild a daily practice that trains this skill when the stakes are low. Ten minutes of mindfulness meditation or breath counting literally rewires the brain for better impulse control; five minutes of journaling each morning keeps a running log of patterns that cloud your judgment. Physical outlets help too—lifting, running, even walks—because a calm nervous system is easier to reason with.\n\nFinally, decide once, not every time. For recurring situations (dating red flags, spending limits, staying up late), write a short set of personal policies while you’re calm. Next time your emotions flare, the decision is already made and you just follow the policy, no debate required.\n\nYou’re not weak for feeling things strongly; you just need a system that catches the emotion, channels it, and lets logic have its say. Give the above a 30‑day trial, track your results, and adjust. It’s work, but it beats letting every spike of feeling steer the wheel.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need to suppress emotions; you need a system that keeps emotions from steering the wheel. Decide your rules when you’re calm and follow them when you’re hot.\n\nAdopt a hard pause. No big decisions while your heart rate is up. Use a 24-hour rule for anything with stakes. In that window, do three things: name the emotion out loud (“this is anger/hope/fear”), regulate physiology (box breathing: 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold for 3–5 minutes), and write a one-page note separating facts from story. Facts = what actually happened. Story = what you’re predicting or hoping.\n\nPre-commit bright-line rules aligned with your values. Examples: “If I don’t see consistent reciprocity for X weeks, I step back.” “If trust is broken twice, I pause contact for Y days and reassess.” Write these when calm and keep them somewhere visible. When the moment comes, you’re executing a policy, not debating a feeling.\n\nUse if-then plans to handle surges. If I feel the urge to chase, then I put my phone away, set a 10-minute timer, take a brisk walk, and fill out my facts-vs-story note. If I feel betrayed, then I schedule a conversation for tomorrow and draft my questions now.\n\nRun decisions through a quick checklist: does this align with my top 3 priorities, would I recommend it to a friend in my shoes, and will it matter in 10 days/10 months/10 years? If it fails two of these, the answer is no or not yet.\n\nLower your emotional baseline with daily reps: 10 minutes of mindfulness (count breaths, gently return when distracted), consistent sleep, and regular exercise. This isn’t about zen; it raises the floor so spikes aren’t as high.\n\nTo break the current paralysis, set a deadline and criteria. Example: “By Friday 6 pm, if X and Y haven’t changed, I will do Z.” Tell one person you trust and put it in your calendar. When the deadline hits, follow the rule you wrote, not the mood you’re in.\n\nThis is a skill. Treat each emotional spike as a rep: pause, regulate, write, then decide by your pre-set rules. It gets clearer and easier the more you practice."

        "best_comment": "I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.\n\nIn my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

        "comment_o3": "I used to wait until panic was the only thing stronger than my dread, so I get it. What finally helped was treating “starting” like its own tiny assignment. Promise yourself you’ll work for just five minutes: open the doc, read the first question, scribble a couple notes. When the timer rings you can quit guilt‑free, but nine times out of ten you’ll already have momentum and keep going. Make tomorrow’s tasks specific and decided the night before—“outline history essay” instead of “work on history.” That way you sit down and act instead of negotiate. Break every big project into mini‑deadlines (outline today, first draft Friday) so you’re still getting the adrenaline kick but in manageable doses. Change locations if you can; a library table or a coffee shop creates a “work” cue and makes bailing feel awkward. And remind yourself the goal is “finished,” not “perfect.” Give yourself permission to write an ugly first version and polish later. If the fear ever tips into full‑on anxiety attacks, talk to a counselor—no shame in using all the resources. Otherwise, treat each five‑minute start like a rep at the gym; the more reps you do, the lighter it gets. You’ve got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "What helps most here is stealing the power from “the start.” Make the start tiny and time‑boxed, then create a substitute for the due‑date pressure.\n\nTry a daily 10‑minute “ugly start.” Same time, same place. Set a timer for 10. Your only job: open the assignment, read the prompt, and produce something deliberately bad in a scratch doc—one messy sentence, a rough outline, or a list of questions. When the timer ends, you’re allowed to stop. The win is starting, not quality. Do this every day and you’ll train your brain that starting is safe and boring, not a verdict on your ability.\n\nRecreate deadlines by breaking each assignment into micro‑deliverables with their own due times: find sources by Tue 6 pm, outline by Wed 6 pm, bad draft by Thu 6 pm. Put these on your calendar with alarms. Add accountability: text a friend, “Outline by 6; I’ll send a pic.” If you miss it, you owe them a small forfeit. No grade needed—the external stake makes the start automatic.\n\nUse a simple start ritual to kill the debate: fill water, open the doc, start the 10‑minute timer, headphones on. Pair it with a trigger like, “After lunch, I do my 10.” When fear spikes, zoom in to the next physical action only: open Canvas → read prompt → highlight the verbs → write one sentence answering one verb. That’s it.\n\nTrack starts, not hours or grades. One checkmark per day you did your 10. After a week of reps, the dread usually drops and the 10 becomes 20–30 without forcing it.\n\nIf you want an extra safety net, do first passes in a “trash” doc you plan to delete. Moving it into the real file later makes it feel less risky.\n\nYou don’t need to be fearless—just build a system where the start is tiny and the deadline is real. Try it for seven days and report back what changed."

I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for.

        "best_comment": "26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer. If I was in your position, I would start there.",

Staying alive has to be priority one or none of the other advice matters.\n\nYou don’t have to fix everything at once. Pick one daily anchor habit that’s so small it feels almost silly, then protect it at all costs for the next two weeks. A brisk 10‑minute walk right after waking up is the one I recommend most because it checks several boxes: sunlight, movement, time away from screens, and a clear “I did something” win before the day even starts. Your brain needs repeated proof that you can set a goal and follow through, even a tiny one.\n\nOnce the walk feels automatic, add the next brick: spend 30 minutes every weekday learning a marketable skill. It could be Google’s free IT Support cert, basic Excel on YouTube, copy‑editing on Coursera, or a community‑college HVAC evening class—whatever looks remotely interesting and leads to a job that hires. You already proved you can finish a degree, so you have the grit; you just need a direction that actually pays. If you truly don’t care which field, lean toward something short, cheap, and in demand so you see progress fast.\n\nDebt can feel overwhelming, but lenders mostly just want regular minimum payments. Open the statement, write the number down, and set up autopay so you never have to look at it again except once a month. That simple step moves the debt from “monster under the bed” to “scheduled bill,” which frees mental bandwidth.\n\nUse your low‑stress living situation to your advantage instead of as a badge of shame. Parents’ house = low overhead. That buys you time to train, stack cash, and stabilize your headspace without rent breathing down your neck.\n\nLast piece: get a therapist if you can, and if meds help you stay functional, that’s a win, not a weakness. Discipline is easier when your chemistry isn’t fighting you the whole way.\n\nTL;DR: tiny daily win (walk), dedicated skill block (30 min), autopay the debt, leverage cheap living, keep the mental‑health safety net in place. String those days together and a year from now you won’t recognize the guy who wrote this post.",
        "comment_gpt5": "26 isn’t “over.” You don’t need to feel motivated to start turning this around; you need a tiny set of non-negotiables and a boring plan you can execute daily.\n\nFirst, safety. If you’re having active thoughts of harming yourself or anyone else, treat it like a medical emergency. In the US call or text 988, or contact your local emergency number. If you’re elsewhere, look up your country’s crisis line and save it in your phone. Tell your prescriber exactly what you wrote here; meds that keep you barely afloat might need an adjustment. If you can, get on a therapy waitlist; CBT for intrusive thoughts is practical and skills-based.\n\nNow, stabilize your baseline. For the next 14 days, keep it absurdly simple: wake up and go to bed at roughly the same time, get 10–20 minutes of daylight and a slow walk before noon, eat one decent protein-heavy meal, shower and brush, and spend 15 minutes tidying your space. That’s it. Set alarms. Check each thing off on paper. Consistency first, intensity later.\n\nUse “no zero days.” When your brain says “why bother,” do five minutes anyway. A single Pomodoro (25 minutes) counts. Put your phone in another room, start a kitchen timer, and work until it dings. Track streaks on a calendar. When you break a streak, your only job is to start a new one the next day.\n\nCareer-wise, pick one lane for the next 90 days. Don’t chase 10 things. Two solid options given your background and constraints:\n\nTech-adjacent. Journalism isn’t useless. It maps to technical writing, content marketing/SEO, customer support, and documentation. Start a portfolio this week. Pick three everyday products or open-source tools, write simple “how to” guides and quickstart docs, and publish them on a free site or GitHub Pages. Take a basic course like Google IT Support, freeCodeCamp’s responsive web design, or CompTIA A+ materials for foundational literacy; study 45–90 minutes a day. After two weeks of consistent study, start sending two targeted applications a day for help desk, QA, support, junior tech writer, or content roles. Your selling point is clear writing and the ability to learn; your portfolio proves it.\n\nTrades/operations. If you want something tangible and in-demand, look at apprenticeships or certs like electrician, HVAC, welding, CDL, or logistics/warehouse supervisor tracks. Call three local shops or unions, ask about apprenticeships, pay during training, and how to apply. Show up on time, work hard, advance quickly. Many of these pay well without needing higher math.\n\nIf math blocked you before but you still like STEM, rebuild it, but do it the disciplined way: 20 minutes a day, every day, starting with Khan Academy Arithmetic/Algebra. Don’t “study,” just do the exercises and keep a streak. Six months of that beats three weeks of cramming and quitting.\n\nMoney: $30k sucks but it’s common and solvable. If it’s federal, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan so the payment is manageable. Set up autopay. Track spending with a simple spreadsheet and cut the top two leaks. If you can add a weekend shift temporarily, do it for three months to build a small emergency fund. Momentum quiets anxiety.\n\nSocial and environment matter. Get out of the house daily, even if it’s only to sit in a library or gym for an hour. Consider one small volunteer gig or group class each week; it gives structure and adds lines to your resume.\n\nExpect it to feel dull, not inspiring. That’s fine. The goal isn’t to feel great; it’s to do the next right thing today. If you run the plan above—daily basics, 45–90 minutes of focused skill/portfolio work, and steady applications—for 60–90 days, your life will look different. In 6–12 months, dramatically different.\n\nYou’re not broken; you’re stuck. Stuck yields to structure. Start tiny today, protect your safety, pick a lane, and keep your streak alive."

        "comment_o3": "Nobody does everything at the same time—what you’re seeing online or imagining is usually a highlight reel plus a lot of trade‑offs that aren’t obvious. Pick a small set of “now” priorities and let the rest wait their turn. Right now that might be work, studying, and basic health. Block specific hours for those in your calendar, then treat the remaining time as negotiable space for the extras (piano, reading, movies, etc.). If something doesn’t fit in the current week, it goes on a later‑this‑month list instead of on your conscience.\n\nThink in seasons rather than days. You might focus heavily on piano for six weeks, then switch the spotlight to fitness while letting piano drop to maintenance practice. Over a year you’ll have touched everything you care about without trying to cram it all into every 24‑hour cycle.\n\nEnergy matters more than clock time, so schedule high‑brain tasks (studying, practice) when you’re freshest and batch low‑brain chores (laundry, groceries) together so they don’t leak into the rest of your day.

        "comment_gpt5": "Short answer: you don’t do everything every day. People who look like they “do it all” are actually choosing a few priorities for this season, keeping tiny maintenance habits for the rest, and running a simple weekly template so they don’t have to think about it.\n\nPick 2–3 things that matter most for the next 8–12 weeks. For a lot of 22-year-olds that’s usually work/study and health. Everything else goes on “maintenance,” not “growth.” Maintenance just means minimum viable doses so you don’t lose ground: 10 minutes of piano after dinner, 15 minutes of cleaning before bed, one grocery + meal prep block a week, 20 minutes of reading before sleep, a movie night once a week, a couple of family calls or visits scheduled. When the season changes, you can rotate which hobby or goal gets the growth focus.\n\nGive each area a floor and a ceiling so you stop all-or-nothing swings. For example: study floor = 60–90 focused minutes on weekdays, ceiling = 3 hours if energy is great; workouts floor = 3×30 minutes a week; piano floor = 10 minutes daily; cleaning floor = 15-minute reset nightly plus a 60-minute weekly reset; groceries/meal prep = one 90-minute block; family/social = two evenings; entertainment = one movie night. Hit the floors consistently; treat anything above as a bonus.\n\nBuild a weekly template, not a heroic daily to-do list. Example: deep work or study right after breakfast when energy is highest; workouts right after work on Mon/Wed/Fri so there’s no decision; piano immediately after dinner; nightly 15-minute tidy; Saturday morning groceries + meal prep; Sunday weekly clean + plan the week. Reading is the default before bed. Movies go on a specific night. If it’s not on the template, it probably won’t happen.\n\nUse triggers and friction to help you remember. “After dinner, sit at piano for 10 minutes” beats “practice sometime.” Keep the keyboard out, workout clothes prepped, grocery list as a recurring note, and recurring reminders on your calendar. Do a 20-minute weekly review to adjust the template and lock in next week’s blocks.\n\nManage energy, not just time. Put the hardest cognitive work early, chores and admin later, and don’t stack multiple heavy tasks back-to-back. Sleep enough, and use timers (25–50 minute blocks) so starting is easy. If you’re tired, do the floor, not zero.\n\nBatch and automate what you can. Cook double and eat leftovers, use a standard grocery list or delivery, clean as you cook, listen to audiobooks or podcasts during chores, and keep your environment set up so the next action is obvious.\n\nFinally, accept tradeoffs. You can do everything you want across a year, but not all at once. The win is steady, boring progress: small floors hit almost every day and a simple template that protects the big rocks. You’re already more productive than last year—that’s exactly how this compounds."

        "comment_o3": "First, book an appointment with a dermatologist or your regular doctor this week. Getting a clear answer on what’s going on (stress shedding, nutrient deficiency, genetic pattern, etc.) puts boundaries around the problem and gives you an action plan. Knowing there’s a concrete next step keeps it from ballooning into a vague, paralyzing worry.\n\nWhile you wait for that visit, treat the hair issue like any other unforeseen obstacle: separate what’s inside your control from what isn’t, then build tiny daily wins around the controllables. You can’t instantly stop the shedding, but you can keep showing up to the gym, prep balanced meals with enough protein and iron, take a multivitamin if recommended, and get seven‑plus hours of sleep to lower cortisol. Each time you tick one of those boxes, remind yourself, “I’m doing my part; the rest is biology.”\n\nIf comments from others are triggering, decide in advance how you’ll respond so it doesn’t knock you off track in the moment. Something short and neutral like “yeah, I’m working on it” then change the subject. Pre‑planning reduces the mental load.\n\nFinally, shrink your baseline habits to the minimum that still counts as “I stayed on track today.” Maybe that’s ten minutes of study and a 20‑minute workout. Most motivation dips are temporary; the folks who get through them are the ones who keep the habit alive in its smallest form until the storm passes.\n\nHandle the medical side, keep the habits tiny but alive, and in a few weeks you’ll have both data and momentum back on your side.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Rough patch, but you can handle it. Think two tracks: address the hair issue and keep your habit muscle active.\n\nFirst, book an appointment with a GP/dermatologist. Even just having it on the calendar reduces mental load and stops the spiral of “what ifs.”\n\nSecond, lower the bar but don’t break the chain. Make a “minimum viable day”: 10–20 minutes of movement (walk, light home workout if the gym feels tough) and one focused study block (Pomodoro, or even just one page). Do it at the same time you used to so the routine stays intact. Use the “never miss twice” rule—if you miss a day, the very next day you hit the minimum. Track it with simple checkmarks.\n\nRemove friction: wear a cap/hoodie at the gym, tie your hair back, keep a lint roller or do a 2-minute vacuum sweep so comments don’t get in your head. Have a script ready for people: “I’m handling it, thanks—don’t want to talk about it,” and change the subject.\n\nAdd quick stress valves: 3 minutes of box breathing before you study/work out, consistent sleep, decent protein and hydration. Tiny wins > perfect days right now.\n\nTreat this like a deload phase. Keep showing up in small ways until you’ve ridden out the storm and sorted the cause. Momentum first, intensity later. You’ve already proven you can start—now prove you can adapt."

        "percentile_10_comment": "I hear ya, Life can be hard. I recently felt quite the same so i can relate to you. I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:\n\n1. Assess my current situation\n2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self\n3. Create SMART goals \n4. Do a daily review of the day\n\n**Assess the situation**.  \nThis is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  \nI started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  \nInfrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  \nThen i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  \nAfter that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\n\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.\n\n**Map out your ideal self**  \nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SMART Goals**  \nWay to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  \nRelevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   \n\n\n**Daily Review**  \nThe hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  \n\n\nSo these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

        "comment_o3": "The good news is you don’t need to “re‑haul” everything at once; you just need a few keystone habits that start compounding. Pick one small win in each area you care about—work, health, social—and protect 30–60 minutes a day for them.\n\nWork: Admin coordinator gives you a ton of transferable skills (organization, scheduling, spreadsheets, communication). Pick one that pays better and double down. For example, take a free Google Project Management or Data Analytics cert on Coursera. Do 30 minutes after work, five days a week, and keep a simple log so you can see hours pile up. Six months of steady half‑hours is 60+ hours—enough to finish a cert and update your résumé.\n\nHealth/energy: Do something that moves your body but doesn’t drain willpower. A 15‑minute walk before breakfast or after work is enough to boost mood and confidence, and it doesn’t require gear or a gym. If you feel like doing more, great, but the rule is “never zero.”\n\nSocial: You already enrolled in dance—perfect. Before each class set a tiny target like saying “Hey, how long have you been dancing?” to one person. Same question every time if you want. Consistency beats cleverness; if you speak to one new person each class, you’ll have talked to 20 by the end of a month.\n\nTrack these three things in a notebook or app with a simple ✔️ each day. Seeing streaks grow is its own motivation and a reminder that you’re not “a failure”; you’re a person who shows up. In a year the compounding looks like: a marketable cert, better energy, and a network of dancers who know your name. That’s a solid foundation to keep stacking on.",
        "comment_gpt5": "First off, you already started by signing up for dance. That’s a win. Don’t try to “rehaul” everything at once—build a tiny, repeatable system and let it compound.\n\nFor the next two weeks, run a minimum routine: 10 minutes of movement (walk, stretch, YouTube), 30 minutes on one career skill, and 5 minutes each night to set up tomorrow (write your top 3 tasks and lay out clothes). If motivation tanks, do the 2‑minute version and call it a success. The point is showing up daily.\n\nPick one skill that clearly upgrades an admin background. Two strong options: intermediate Excel/Sheets (pivot tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, basic dashboards) and the Google Project Management certificate. That combo can move you toward Operations Coordinator, Project Coordinator, Recruiting Coordinator, or Executive Assistant roles that usually pay more than admin coordinator. Do one lesson a day and build a tiny project each week (e.g., a simple project plan in Sheets, a dashboard of fake company data). Libraries often give free access to LinkedIn Learning; Coursera has financial aid.\n\nUpdate your resume with numbers: “Managed calendar for 3 execs, scheduled 60+ meetings/week, cut vendor response time by 30%, maintained database of 1,200 records with 99% accuracy.” Search those target titles and mirror the keywords. Set a weekly cadence: 10–15 tailored applications, 2 informational messages on LinkedIn to people in roles you want (short, polite, one question), and one measurable improvement at work you can quantify for your resume. Switching companies is usually the fastest raise, but also ask for more responsibility once you’ve built some skills.\n\nFor friends, set a micro-goal in dance: say hello to one person each class and ask one small question (“How long have you been taking this class?”). After a couple classes: “I’m grabbing water after—is it cool if I join you?” Low pressure, repeated often. If you can, add one more recurring group thing in the next month (another class, volunteer shift, book club). Reps matter.\n\nDo a 20-minute weekly review every Sunday. Look at the past week, check your streak, plan the next seven days, and block your 30-minute skill sessions. Track the streak somewhere visible. Don’t break it.\n\nA simple 30/60/90: by day 30, finish the first Excel course or PM module, refresh your resume, apply to 30 roles total, and say hi to 4–6 people in class. By day 60, complete the certificate or second Excel course, build two tiny portfolio pieces, do 4 informational chats, apply to 60 roles total. By day 90, you should have a tighter resume, a couple projects to show, 8+ chats, and interview practice under your belt.\n\nYou’re not behind—you just need a boring, repeatable system. One small block a day for 90 days will change a lot. Keep it simple and keep showing up."

I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - \n\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \n\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\n\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?",

Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\n\nI can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference",
        "percentile_10_comment": "You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).",
        "comment_o3": "Been there during the peak of lockdown – weekdays felt like an airport lounge where I was just killing time until the flight to Friday. A few changes pulled me out of that loop.\n\nFirst, put a fence around work. WFH blurs the edges, so you have to draw them yourself. Decide a hard shut‑down time (say 7 pm), put it in your calendar, tell your manager you’ll be offline after that unless there’s an emergency, then actually close the laptop and put it in a drawer. Most bosses won’t push back if you’re delivering; the boundary forces you to work with more intention and keeps the evenings clear for life.\n\nSecond, treat each weekday like a mini‑weekend by scheduling one small “anchor” you genuinely look forward to. Could be a 30‑minute guitar lesson on Monday night, a pick‑up basketball game on Tuesday, a fancy coffee and a book on Wednesday morning, whatever. When there’s something positive waiting at 6 pm, the day stops feeling like an endurance test.\n\nThird, give your body a reason to get out of bed. Set the alarm for the same time every day, get vertical immediately (phone across the room helps), splash water on your face and step outside for 2 minutes of sunlight or a daylight lamp. Follow it with 5–10 push‑ups, squats, or stretching. Tiny, but it signals to your brain that the day has started and it’s no longer sleep time.\n\nFourth, clean up the coping loop with food by changing the environment, not your willpower. Keep trigger snacks out of the house, prep easy high‑protein meals on Sunday so Weekday‑You doesn’t have to think, and put fruit or nuts where the chips used to be. If the only “lazy” option is something decent, that’s what you’ll eat.\n\nFinally, don’t try to make peace with a 40‑year sentence. Think in 3‑month experiments. “For the next quarter I’ll hold a 7 pm work curfew, lift on M/W/F, and practice Spanish T/Th for 20 minutes.” Review, tweak, repeat. Careers, companies, and you will all change many times before retirement. Your job is to build routines and skills that travel with you.\n\nWeekends will still be fun, they just won’t be the only time you feel alive. Good luck—you’ve got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t have to accept 40 years of this. Treat the next 2–4 weeks as an experiment to change the structure that’s making weekdays feel like a hostage situation.\n\nFirst, put a hard boundary on work. Pick a daily shutdown time and protect it with a calendar block. Do a brief shutdown ritual: write tomorrow’s top 3 tasks, close work apps, physically close the laptop and leave the work area. If you’re worried about underperforming, book a 1:1 and ask, “If I finish only one thing this week, what should it be?” Then guard one 60–90 minute morning block for that work before you touch email/Slack. Keep a simple “done” list so you can see progress.\n\nSecond, deliberately seed your weekdays with small things you enjoy so you’re not starving for Saturday. Put a 30-minute hobby, a walk outside, or a show with a friend on the calendar Mon–Thu. Move a couple of chores to weeknights so your weekend isn’t all recovery + errands. Kill the Sunday dread by planning Monday on Friday afternoon or Sunday morning: write your MITs, prep notes, and choose the exact task you’ll start with.\n\nThird, fix the “staying in bed” loop. Pick one wake time and make “feet on floor within two minutes” a rule. Put the alarm across the room, leave water and shoes by the bed, open blinds, and step outside for light within 10 minutes. No phone in bed. Aim for about 8–8.5 hours in bed; if you’re awake, get up. Energy will follow the routine, not the other way around.\n\nFor food, add structure and a pause. Plan three meals plus one snack with protein and fiber. When the urge to cope-eat hits, set a 10-minute timer, drink water, stand up and walk around; if you still want it afterward, eat a portion on a plate at the table. Keep trigger foods out of reach or pre-portion them. You’re not banning comfort food—just inserting a decision point.\n\nMake it concrete: for the next two weeks, choose a daily hard stop (say 6:30), a morning deep-work block before lunch, a 20-minute walk outside every day, and one micro-joy each weekday. Do a 20-minute weekly review on Friday. Track it on a sticky note and aim for 80% consistency. If, after setting boundaries and aligning priorities, the culture still expects 12-hour days, that’s a signal to start looking elsewhere—you don’t owe your next decades to a broken setup.\n\nRespect each day by giving it one clear win: move your body, move one important task, do one thing you enjoy. Stack two weeks of that and the weekend stops being the only time you feel alive. You’ve got this."

      "body": "Hi guys,\nI’m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It’s bad because i’ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)",

It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. \n\nOne thing I will say is that it’s a journey. It’s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It’s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It’s going to happen, it’s going to be ok, and it does get better. \n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. \n\nI’m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that’s making you feel bad. But it’s a good place to start when trying to get on track. \n\nProtect your sleep. Do that by:\n\n- Going to bed at the same time every night. \n- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you’ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \n\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.",
        "comment_o3": "What helped me stick with a similar “mental‑health first” routine was treating each habit like brushing my teeth: not negotiable, but the intensity can vary day to day. I planned a tiny, can’t‑fail version of every task—five minutes of the program, two minutes of meditation, ten push‑ups or a short walk, walking into the corner store to buy gum. On good days I often did more, but if my mood cratered I could still hit the minimum and keep the streak alive. That one change killed the all‑or‑nothing thinking that used to send me spiraling.\n\nI put every task in my calendar with alarms and labelled them “appointments.” The less deciding I do in the moment, the less my brain can negotiate. Habit‑tracking apps like Loop (Android) or Streaks (iOS) give you a satisfying visual chain; I check mine off immediately afterward so the reward is instant. If you like gamification, Habitica turns your tasks into an RPG and has guilds for social anxiety where people cheer each other on.\n\nAccountability multiplies discipline, so I post my daily checklist in a small Discord with two friends. If I don’t report by 10 p.m. they ping me. You can get a similar effect from r/90daygoal or the daily threads here.\n\nFinally, expect the occasional miss. One slip isn’t a relapse; it’s a data point. When it happens I write down what tripped me up, adjust tomorrow’s plan, and move on. Consistency beats perfection, and the fact that you’ve already stuck with the program for a month shows you have the chops to do this. Good luck—you start again every morning, and that’s a powerful advantage.",
        "comment_gpt5": "First off, nice work sticking with the program for a month. Exposures are no joke. The trick now is to make “showing up” so small and automatic that even on rough days you still get a win.\n\nUse floors and ceilings. Set a tiny floor for each item so you never have a zero day: therapy program = open it and do 5 minutes, meditation = 1 minute, workout = 5 minutes or one set, social = step into a store and say one sentence (ask a simple question or greet a cashier). On good days, go past the floor; on bad days, just hit the floor and call it a win. Track “did the floor” as success.\n\nTime it, don’t just list it. Same sequence every day so there’s less decision-making: after breakfast open the therapy module; right after that put on shoes and go do the social rep; meditate before your shower; do the workout in a fixed 15–20 min block. Habit stacking keeps it simple.\n\nPre-decide your moves. Write if-then scripts and put them where you see them. “If I catch myself scrolling in bed, I stand up, put the phone in another room, do 60 seconds of breathing, and start the therapy module.” “If I feel the urge to skip the social thing, I will walk to the nearest store and ask where X is.” Treat it like a fire drill, not a debate.\n\nBuild a ladder for the social piece. List 10 rungs from easiest to hardest and repeat each rung until it’s boring before you move up. Coordinate with your program so it fits the therapy plan.\n\nAssume a miss and script recovery now. “If I miss a day, the next morning I do the floor of all four, text my accountability buddy ‘reset done,’ and mark an R on the calendar.” Give yourself two streak freezes per month so your brain doesn’t catastrophize one off day.\n\nMake friction for the phone and rewards for the hard stuff. Charge your phone outside the bedroom, use Screen Time/Forest to cap apps, and pair the social rep with a small reward (favorite tea, playlist, 10 min of a show) right after.\n\nApps/communities that actually help: Loop Habit Tracker or Streaks for simple checkmarks, Habitica if you like gamified tasks, Beeminder if money-on-the-line helps, and Focusmate for body-doubling your therapy module/workout. Daily check-in threads here or texting a friend a quick ✅ pic keeps you honest.\n\nYou don’t need perfect days—you need reliable ones. Keep the floor tiny, the timing consistent, and the recovery automatic. Do that for a few weeks and you’ll have momentum that makes slipping much less likely. You’ve got this."

        "comment_o3": "A lot of people wait to “discover” a passion when what usually happens is they stumble into it after a stretch of focused doing. Think of it less like hunting for buried treasure and more like running a series of short, deliberate experiments. Pick one direction that feels promising—physical sciences, for example, since that was the last time you remember genuine interest—and give it a six‑month sprint. During that time build a simple, repeatable routine: spend an hour a day on foundational study, an hour on a hands‑on side project (could be a small electronics kit, a data‑analysis notebook, a short explanatory video), and finish each session by writing two sentences about what felt energizing and what felt draining. At the three‑month mark reread those notes. If your average day still feels like the “dry hole,” pivot to the next experiment on the list. If the notes are trending positive, double down for another six months.\n\nTwo rules keep the process honest: cap your experiments at one or two simultaneous commitments so you don’t spread thin, and make sure each one ends with something concrete you can show—an Arduino gadget, a Medium article, a five‑minute explainer on YouTube. Tangible outputs give you real feedback and build a portfolio at the same time.\n\nYou already like problem‑solving and reaching people, so look for intersections: science communication, data journalism, user‑research inside tech, or even product management where micro‑economics, psychology, and design all collide. Those fields reward honesty and have broad impact, which matches your values. And if you still want to try the self‑help or daily‑routine channel, run it the same way: schedule six weeks, script ten short videos, post them on a fixed cadence, then review the numbers and your own enthusiasm before deciding whether to scale.\n\nDiscipline here isn’t about iron willpower; it’s about building a small structure that makes these experiments automatic. Block the time on your calendar, set a visible tracker on your wall, and commit to not breaking the chain for the full sprint. Whether or not any single project becomes “the one,” you’ll come out with stronger habits, clearer data on what excites you, and a growing stack of skills you can leverage anywhere.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t “find” passion first; you earn it by doing reps on problems you care about and getting small wins. Thinking harder won’t answer this. Shipping things will.\n\nPick one problem to test for 6 weeks. Examples that fit your values and skills: evidence-based health/product reviews that fight misinformation, practical psychology/econ explainers applied to everyday decisions, or science mythbusting aimed at a general audience. Tie it to your honesty value and desire to reach lots of people.\n\nDefine a tiny, boringly specific output schedule and stick to it. For 6 weeks, block 90 minutes daily for creation, and publish something every week: one YouTube short + one longform post, or one written article + one infographic. Use your existing tools: programming for data scraping or visualizations, design for thumbnails and clarity, audio engineering for clean voiceover. Don’t plan more than three days; launch by day four.\n\nTrack four signals each day: energy before/after the session, what you learned, one skill you improved, and any feedback or engagement. At the end of each week, adjust the next week’s topic based on data, not mood. If by week 6 your energy trend and output quality are up, extend for 12 weeks. If not, pivot the niche but keep the schedule.\n\nIf you want more implementation and broader impact without going full creator, target roles that blend analysis with shipping: product management/ops, behavior change or growth at a health-tech or ed-tech org, UX research with live experiments. Use your 6-week project as a portfolio: “I ran X experiments, here were the insights, here’s what I built.”\n\nKill passive consumption. For the next month, only watch history/self-help/K-pop videos if you take notes and produce one piece derived from them within 48 hours. No output, no input.\n\nA simple daily structure that works: wake, 90-minute maker block, walk, day job, 30-minute skill drill tied to your project (scriptwriting, data viz, or audio mixing), 10-minute review and tomorrow’s top task set before you stop. On Sundays, pick the next week’s topics and decide the single artifact you’ll ship.\n\nDon’t wait to “feel ready” for YouTube. Agree to ship 10 pieces, then judge. Passion follows competence, impact, and community; you’ll only get those by showing up consistently and letting the feedback loop teach you what sticks."

It was a 1-year relationship, and she was my first true love ever. I really wanted us to work so badly, but it didn't happen. It was a \"healthy\" breakup, but I just couldn't accept it. She wanted us to stay \"friends,\" but I said no. Even if it hurt me so fucking bad. The thing is that I felt safe during her. I showed too much emotion. I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore. I don't want to be famous and get easily affected by my emotions. I want to know how to control my mind and my emotions so people can rely on me in the future. And I have absolutely no idea where to start because I feel lost every time.I don't really know if it's the right sub to post in, but I like how the guys think here.\nthanks,\n ",

Just need to be around people who appreciate who you are. \n\nDon't change for others, just be yourself.\n\nAre you in the UK by any chance?\n\nPaul",

Unless it's to the point where you're using your partner as a trauma dumpster when you really need to be in therapy, medicated, and in the gym to help manage your emotional help then you aren't weak. You're just human.",
        "comment_o3": "First thing: nothing is “wrong” with you for feeling gutted after a breakup. It hurts because you cared, and caring is not weakness. What matters now is what you do with the energy that’s sloshing around after that loss. Discipline is really just the habit of directing that energy on purpose instead of letting it leak everywhere.\n\nStart by giving your days a basic structure. Wake‑up time, bed time, three meals, some movement, something productive, something genuinely relaxing. If you nail the fundamentals—sleep, decent food, exercise—you’ll be shocked how much emotional turbulence settles on its own. Pick one anchor habit that you can hit no matter what: a 30‑minute walk every morning, a short lift session after work, whatever is sustainable. Treat that habit like brushing your teeth: non‑negotiable.\n\nNext, train the mind the same way you’re training the body. Ten minutes of meditation, or even just sitting with a notebook and dumping all the messy thoughts onto paper, will teach you to watch emotions instead of being yanked around by them. Pair that with some Stoic or CBT‑style reflection: ask yourself, “Is this feeling helpful? Is it telling me to act, or is it just noise?” Over time you’ll get quicker at spotting unhelpful loops and steering back to what you can control.\n\nBecause a breakup can leave a huge gap in your social and purpose “buckets,” deliberately fill them. See friends in person, join a hobby group, volunteer, take a course—anything that reminds you you’re part of something bigger than your own head. Momentum is your friend here; the more small wins you stack, the easier the next one feels.\n\nTrack progress somewhere visible—a calendar you don’t want to break, a notes app, whatever. The point isn’t perfection; it’s proving to yourself day after day that you keep promises to yourself. That’s where real confidence comes from, not from never feeling sad again.\n\nIf the grief still feels overwhelming after a couple of months of genuine effort, there’s zero shame in talking to a therapist. Think of it as hiring a personal trainer for your head.\n\nFinally, remember that discipline isn’t about becoming a stoic robot. It’s about having enough control that you can choose when to be open and when to be reserved. You’re already on that path by asking for help. Keep showing up for yourself and the strength—mental and physical—will follow.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Breakups can scramble your routines and your head. The way out is through structure, not trying to become emotionless. “Control” isn’t not feeling things; it’s feeling them and still doing what you said you’d do.\n\nStart with a simple 30‑day rebuild. Pick a wake time you can keep 7 days a week and protect 8 hours in bed. Move your body every day: a 30‑minute walk daily and 3 strength sessions a week. If you’re new, do pushups/rows/squats/planks at home or run a beginner plan like StrongLifts 5x5. Eat three real meals with protein, drink water, and cut alcohol for the month. This stabilizes energy and mood so the mental work is even possible.\n\nAdd a 10‑minute daily “mind control” drill. Sit, breathe in for 4, out for 6, and watch thoughts come and go without acting on them. When urges hit (text her, stalk socials, spiral) say “there’s an urge,” breathe, and let 60–90 seconds pass before you choose your next action. That gap is the muscle you’re trying to build. A short journal at night helps too: one page answering, “What did I do today my future self will thank me for? What’s the plan tomorrow?” Keep it under 5 minutes.\n\nSet rules so you don’t rely on willpower. No contact and no checking her socials for 60 days. Phone sleeps outside the bedroom. Workouts happen M/W/F after work, non‑negotiable. If a rule gets broken, reset immediately and make it harder to happen again (block, unfollow, app limits).\n\nTrack it on paper. Make a tiny grid with sleep, walk, workout, meditate, journal, no‑contact. Cross off each day. Your goal isn’t perfection; it’s showing up more days than not. On Sundays, review your week in 10 minutes, adjust what’s too ambitious, and plan the next one.\n\nIf you want resources, Atomic Habits for systems, The Obstacle Is the Way or The Daily Stoic for perspective, and a free meditation app like Insight Timer to guide the 10 minutes. If therapy is available, it’s basically coaching for exactly these skills.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person to be reliable. You need reps. Give yourself 30 days of this and you will feel steadier. Tonight: set tomorrow’s wake time, lay out your clothes, schedule your workout, and put your phone in another room before bed. Do that, then do it again tomorrow. That’s how you build the guy you want to be."

        "percentile_10_comment": "Yo homie I also didn't get past 7th grade, I got my GED at 30, then started college 2 years after that. I'm an engineer now. It's possible for you as well, learn about passing the GED as an exam instead of trying to learn what's on it (the big books the give you are intimidating), being in college is rewarding as you are around people motivated to learn. Community college will be a better resource at first until you are ready to transfer to a university.",
        "comment_o3": "You’re not too far gone at all—24 is a perfectly normal age to be figuring this out and people ten, twenty, even thirty years older than you do it every year. The short version of the process is: get the GED, use it to enroll in community college, then transfer or continue from there.  \n\nFirst step: make an account on GED.com. That site is run by the company that administers the test, and it walks you through registration, state‑specific rules, testing centers, fees, and free practice questions. Take the diagnostic quizzes right away; they’ll show where you’re strong and where you need work, which keeps your study time focused instead of random.  \n\nNext, call or email the nearest community college’s “adult education” or “continuing education” department. Almost every state funds free or very low‑cost GED prep classes—many meet at night or online and include tutors. If you suspect a learning disability, tell them; the GED has official accommodations (extra time, private room, etc.) and colleges often have disability services that can help you document and receive them.  \n\nNow the discipline piece: treat studying like a shift at work. Pick a specific block of time you can defend—say 7–9 p.m. on weeknights—and sit in the same spot with your phone on airplane mode until the block is over. Start each session by writing the single topic you’ll cover (e.g., “fractions” or “social studies practice test”) at the top of a sheet of paper and end by jotting what to tackle tomorrow, so you never waste time wondering what’s next. Khan Academy, GED Flash, and plenty of YouTube channels cover everything for free; the key is consistency, not perfect resources. Aim for four or five study blocks a week and track them on a calendar so you can see the streak grow.  \n\nOnce your GED practice scores are comfortably above passing, schedule the real exams one at a time. Passing all four subjects instantly makes you eligible for federal financial aid; fill out the FAFSA as soon as it opens in October and apply to the community college for Spring 2024 admission. They’ll likely give you a placement test and, if needed, remedial math or English courses—which is normal and nothing to be embarrassed about.  \n\nThe plan is straightforward: GED account tonight, call the adult‑ed office tomorrow, study on a fixed schedule, knock out the four exams, file FAFSA, enroll. Keep your daily study habit small but non‑negotiable, and the months between now and spring will be more than enough. You’ve already done the hardest part by deciding to act; now it’s just reps. You got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not too far gone. Plenty of adults get a GED in their 20s and go on to college. The path is clear, you just need a simple plan and consistent reps.\n\nStart at ged.com and make a free account. It shows your state’s rules, test centers, costs, and lets you take the official GED Ready practice tests. Some states use HiSET instead (hiset.org). Also call your local community college or public library and ask for “Adult Basic Education” or “GED prep”—they often have free classes, tutors, and sometimes test-fee vouchers.\n\nTake a diagnostic (GED Ready) for each subject to see where you’re at. Then pick an exam date 8–12 weeks out for your first subject and build backward. Many people do one subject at a time to build momentum. Study 60–90 minutes a day, 5–6 days a week. Resources that work: Khan Academy for math and science reading/data, GED.com’s own prep, and a GED prep book from the library (McGraw-Hill or Steck-Vaughn). Focus first on Reasoning Through Language Arts and Math; Social Studies and Science are largely reading, charts, and basic reasoning.\n\nIf you suspect a learning disability, ask your community college’s disability services how to get evaluated and how to request GED testing accommodations (extra time, breaks, etc.). GED Testing Service has an accommodations portal—you’ll need documentation, so start that soon.\n\nFor college, community colleges are built for this transition. Apply now, meet an advisor, and ask about placement tests and whether you can start with a class while finishing your GED. Fill out the FAFSA at studentaid.gov for financial aid; ask the college’s financial aid office about deadlines and state grants. If spring is tight, aim for the next term—the key is steady progress now.\n\nDiscipline basics that help: set a daily study block tied to a trigger (e.g., right after breakfast), use Pomodoro (25 minutes on, 5 off), and set a “minimum” on tough days (20 minutes still counts). Study in the same spot, phone out of reach, and keep a simple habit tracker or calendar X for each day you show up. Do a 15-minute weekly review every Sunday to plan which lessons you’ll cover and when you’ll take the next practice test. Get accountability—a tutor, a friend, or even a weekly check-in post.\n\nLogistics: you’ll need valid ID for testing. You can take the four GED subjects separately, and many states offer discounted retakes. After you pass one, schedule the next while the momentum is high.\n\nYou’ve already done the hardest part by deciding to change. Start with the GED account and a practice test this week, pick your first test date, and make tomorrow your first 60-minute study session. In a few months, you can have a GED in hand and be enrolling in classes. One session at a time. You’ve got this."

        "comment_o3": "Start with the basics: consistent 7‑8 hour sleep, real meals with protein and complex carbs, plenty of water, and a bit of movement every day. The moment those slip, no amount of coffee keeps you alert, and caffeine tolerance rises fast. If you can, drop coffee for a week so your receptors reset—your first cup back will feel like rocket fuel.\n\nDry lectures are brutal when you’re just transcribing. Skim the notes or textbook before class and write down a handful of questions you actually want answered. In lecture, focus on listening for the answers instead of copying every line; afterward, try to explain the proof to a friend or a rubber duck. Teaching forces active engagement and cuts study time later.\n\nKeep study blocks short enough that willpower doesn’t flatline. The classic Pomodoro (25‑on, 5‑off, four rounds then a longer break) works because you’re never more than a few minutes from standing up. During those breaks, leave the desk—walk around the building, stretch, do a set of push‑ups—anything that pumps blood and gives your eyes a screen break.\n\nSchedule real downtime so it’s recovery, not procrastination. Decide, for example, that Saturday night is pure Netflix with zero guilt, then on Sunday morning you’re back at the desk. Having set “on” and “off” hours keeps your brain from trying to escape all week.\n\nMost “burnout” is basic maintenance debt. Fix sleep, food, water, and movement first, swap passive note‑taking for active learning, and your energy comes back surprisingly fast. Good luck; you’ve got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need more willpower; you need a short reset and a better structure.\n\nFirst, do a deload. Take 1–2 days off heavy studying and caffeine. Sleep 8–9 hours, get a 20–30 min walk in daylight, drink water, and eat actual meals with protein and carbs. No all‑day Netflix—keep it to a set window so it feels like a treat, not the whole day. This alone often brings energy back.\n\nThen switch from marathon sessions to sprints. Use 25/5 or 50/10 timers, cap your day at something like 3–4 focused blocks for a few days, and stop while you still have gas. Minimum viable goal: sit down, open the material, and do the first 25 minutes—anything after that is bonus. Momentum > intensity right now.\n\nMake the dry stuff less passive. Stop transcribing proofs. Before class, skim for 10 minutes and write down 2–3 questions. During lecture, capture the main claim, the key lemmas, and where you’re confused. After, spend 20–30 minutes doing practice problems or re‑deriving steps without notes. Teach the gist to an imaginary student or a friend. If the professor isn’t engaging, supplement or replace with a clearer source (textbook sections, a good YouTube playlist) and use lecture only for attendance/announcements.\n\nFix your environment and body cues. Bright light in the morning, cool room, upright posture. Stand or walk during breaks. A set “study spot” only for work, and keep Netflix off that device. If you’re nodding off, do 10 air squats, splash cold water, or take a 10‑minute power nap—then one more block.\n\nCaffeine tolerance is real. Take a short reset, then bring it back strategically: 100–200 mg right before your first deep‑work block, none after early afternoon.\n\nFinally, plan your week like an athlete: 4–5 study days, 1–2 lighter days, 1 true rest day. If after a week of sleep, food, movement, and scaled‑back blocks you still feel physically wiped, get a quick check‑in with a doctor just to rule out anything medical.\n\nYou’re not broken—your system is just overreached and bored. Deload, make it active, and rebuild with small, consistent wins. You’ll feel the spark come back."

When I find myself unmotivated, lounging, slacking etc, I ask myself “What is something small I can do right now?”. This has helped feel some sense of accomplishment. No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick.

Pick one task that actually matters this week—say, reading for class, cleaning the desk, updating a résumé—and commit to touching it for five minutes today. Set a timer, do the five minutes, then walk away guilt‑free. Most of the time you’ll keep going because starting is the hard part, but even if you stop you’ve still logged a win and proved to your brain that “I do what I say.”\n\nOnce you have a couple of five‑minute wins under your belt, schedule them for the same time each day so it turns into a default routine rather than a decision. Stack a cue you already do (morning coffee, lunch break, shutting the laptop at night) with the tiny task, then reward yourself immediately after—something as small as a stretch, a song, or scrolling Reddit. That cue‑routine‑reward loop is what slowly rewires the mindset you’re talking about.\n\nNext level: create tomorrow’s to‑do list tonight and limit it to three items max. Anything else you finish is a bonus. When the list is short you spend less energy choosing and more energy doing. Use an actual timer (Pomodoro, 25/5, whatever) so you can’t wander into YouTube or TikTok without noticing.\n\nKeep tracking the streak on paper or in an app; humans hate breaking streaks. Expect off days and treat them like speed bumps, not roadblocks—just restart the streak the next morning without the self‑talk spiral. Discipline is basically momentum plus memory: the more often you see evidence that you can start, the easier it is to believe you’ll keep going.\n\nTry this for two weeks, then widen the time block or add a second five‑minute habit. Slow growth feels frustratingly small in the moment, but it compounds faster than sporadic bursts of motivation. Good luck, and see you back here with progress updates.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Yes, this is the right sub. You don’t need a new mindset before you act—the mindset shows up after a streak of small wins. Overwhelm happens when you treat “everything” as one task. Shrink the scope and schedule it.\n\nHere’s a simple way to start today: do a 5–10 minute brain dump of everything on your mind, pick one area that would make the biggest difference if it improved, and define the next physical action that takes 10 minutes or less. Then set an implementation intention: “At 7:30 pm, at my desk, I will work on X for 10 minutes.” Start a timer. When it rings, you can stop. If you keep going, great, but the win is starting and finishing the block you scheduled.\n\nMake it hard to procrastinate and easy to start. Put your phone in another room, open the doc you need before you walk away, lay out tools the night before, and use a site blocker during your 10-minute block. Track it with a simple X on a calendar. Rule: never miss twice. If you miss a day, the only goal is to show up for two minutes the next day and rebuild momentum.\n\nCap your daily focus to one main task at first. As that feels normal, nudge the time up by 5 minutes each week or add a second tiny task. When you feel overwhelmed, zoom into the next tiny step: open the file, write one ugly sentence, clear five emails, wash one dish. If your brain says “there’s not enough time,” do two minutes anyway and earn the right to stop.\n\nDo a weekly review on Sunday: what worked, what didn’t, what’s the one thing for next week, and when exactly you’ll do it. If you can skim by forever, add light accountability—tell a friend your daily block, post a check-in, or use a body-doubling tool like Focusmate.\n\nStart with ten minutes today.

I’ve seen how completing the 5am workouts has given me more energy throughout the day and also made me more conscious about my food choices. I want to make this a habit. \nI am a morning person so no problem waking up at 5am but I do find myself gravitating towards work rather than working out. \n\nAppreciate your advice!",

        "comment_o3": "You already know how to lock in habits, so treat the 5 a.m. workout the same way: engineer the cue, lower the barrier, and attach a reward. Set out your clothes, shoes, and a written plan the night before so the first decision is made for you. Keep your laptop and any work materials out of sight until the workout is finished—make the path to exercise the path of least resistance and the path to work slightly annoying. Tie the session to an existing habit: alarm rings → bathroom → quick splash of cold water → straight into workout gear. Promise yourself you only have to do ten minutes; once you’re moving, momentum usually carries you through the full session, but the tiny commitment prevents negotiation. After you finish, allow yourself something you like—a good coffee, the green light to open your inbox, whatever feels rewarding—so your brain pairs “workout complete” with a payoff. If you still struggle, add accountability: post the workout you did in a shared doc with a friend, or snap a timestamped photo and send it to a group chat. A few weeks of this loop and the 5 a.m. workout will start to feel as automatic as flossing.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Nice work on flossing and cold showers — you’ve already proven you can build habits. Your issue isn’t waking up; it’s the pull toward work. Solve it with one rule: no work before workout. Close and put away your laptop the night before, block email/Slack 4:30–6:30, and put a calendar “meeting” on your 5am workout so you don’t negotiate.\n\nMake starting brainless. Lay out clothes, shoes, and water. Have a tiny starting ritual: bathroom, sip water, 3-minute warm-up. Use a 10-minute rule: you only have to do 10 minutes, then you can quit guilt-free. Most days you’ll keep going; on tough days you still keep the streak.\n\nRemove decisions. Pick a simple plan and run it on autopilot: A/B full-body or a timed circuit for 25–35 minutes. Same days, same exercises, same order. Start with 3 days/week; on off days do a 5-minute “token” session (mobility, pushups, air squats) so the 5am cue stays attached to movement.\n\nDefuse the work urge by doing a 2-minute brain dump on paper as soon as you wake up. Capture the tasks so your brain stops chasing them. Pair a reward with training: coffee, your favorite podcast, or the hot shower only after the workout. Track it somewhere visible.\n\nProtect the input that makes this possible: a hard bedtime that supports 5am, and no late-night screens. Have a fallback: if you miss 5am, do a 10-minute mini after your first work block. Never miss twice.\n\nYou already know 5am training improves your day. Make it the default and make work wait its turn. In a few weeks it’ll feel automatic."

      "body": "\nI am a 27yo working female living alone in a metropolitan city in India. My work timings are usually 10-6 but it’s not very in terms of when I reach. However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. \nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\nIs it too much to ask ? Please help.\nAlso, I find it difficult to wake up super early so I usually try to wake up by 8am. I am trying to wake earlier though.",

        "percentile_10_comment": "Clean dishes + stockpiled fruits, vegetables, meat = easy and quick cooking whenever you need it",
        "comment_o3": "I’m in the same boat with a full‑time job and no outside help, and the only way I’ve made it work is by turning everything into a system instead of a daily decision. Pick one grocery day and one bulk‑cooking block per week—Saturday morning, Sunday evening, whatever—and treat them like non‑negotiable appointments. On grocery day you buy for a fixed menu of 3‑4 simple dishes that all share ingredients (for example: chana masala, stir‑fried veggies, and lemon rice use overlapping onions, tomatoes, peppers, and spices). On cooking day you batch‑cook double or triple portions, portion them into individual containers, and stack them in the fridge/freezer. Reheating when you get home takes five minutes, so dinner and tomorrow’s lunch are sorted and the mental chatter about what to eat disappears.\n\nA cheap pressure cooker or Instant Pot pays for itself in time: throw soaked lentils + veggies + spices in the morning, set delay timer, and it’s ready when you walk through the door. One‑pot dishes also mean almost no dishes—lid, pot, spoon, done. For the rest of the kitchen mess, wash as you cook; you’re standing there watching something simmer anyway.\n\nHousework is the same “small daily, bigger weekly” system. Set a 10‑minute timer every night for a quick reset of the living room and dishes, and a 30‑minute timer on Sunday for sweeping, mopping, and bathroom wipe‑down. That’s under two hours total per week, far less than the mental load of wondering when you’ll clean. If you ever fall behind, hire a maid for a one‑off deep clean, then go back to your maintenance routine.\n\nFor workouts, don’t chase a perfect 90‑minute gym session. A 20‑minute bodyweight circuit or yoga flow right after waking will move your energy up a notch. Lay out clothes and a mat the night before so 8 a.m. you roll out of bed and start, no thinking required. Once that habit sticks you can decide whether getting up earlier is worth the extra training time.\n\nThe common thread is front‑loading decisions. Decide once a week what you’ll eat, when groceries happen, when cooking happens, when cleaning happens, and when you exercise. Put those blocks on your calendar the same way you’d schedule meetings, then run the script. It feels rigid at first, but the payoff is all the free headspace after work to actually relax instead of juggling chores.",
        "comment_gpt5": "It’s not too much to ask. You’re trying to do three things at once (work, home, health), so the trick is to remove decisions and compress tasks. Try this 2-week experiment and then adjust.\n\nFirst, set defaults. Pick two breakfasts and three dinners you’ll repeat. Example: breakfast = poha or oats+curd+fruit. Dinners rotate between khichdi, dal-chawal with a sabzi, and egg/paneer bhurji with rotis. Decide once, repeat, no daily brainstorming. Make a master grocery list for these meals and set a recurring weekly order on BigBasket/Blinkit/Zepto. Keep pantry staples always stocked: onions, tomatoes, garlic-ginger paste, canned/soaked beans, rice, atta, eggs, frozen veggies, curd, paneer.\n\nBatch the heavy lifting twice a week. Sunday and Wednesday after work or Sunday morning, spend 60–90 minutes prepping. Use a pressure cooker with separators to cook dal, rice, and a steamed veg in one go. Make a big onion-tomato masala base and freeze in small portions. Boil 6–8 eggs. Soak and pressure cook chana/rajma for the week; freeze portions. Knead atta for 2–3 days, or buy ready phulkas/frozen rotis. When you get home at 7:30, dinner becomes assembly: reheat rice, add masala to a pan, toss in pre-cooked dal/veg/paneer, and you’re eating in 15–20 minutes. Cook dinner with one extra portion for next day’s lunch and pack it before bed.\n\nStreamline cleanup. Cook mostly one-pot. Use one good kadhai and the pressure cooker; avoid a mountain of utensils. Clean as you go, then run a 10-minute “reset” timer before bed: wipe counters, soak anything sticky, start the next day’s soak/soak beans if needed. If dishes are your biggest pain, consider a tiny outsource: either get a maid just for jhaadu-pocha-bartan for 30–40 minutes a day or book an Urban Company weekly deep clean. You can keep it strictly task-based to reduce hassle. Another hybrid: use a tiffin service for lunch on workdays and only cook dinner; you’ll still save money and brain space versus ordering out daily.\n\nMorning routine doesn’t have to be “super early.” Aim for 20 minutes. Lay out workout clothes at night. Do a simple at-home circuit right after you brush: squats, push-ups (incline on a table if needed), rows with a backpack, and a plank. Set a 20-minute timer and stop when it rings. Breakfast is one of your defaults, ready in 5–10 minutes. Move wake time earlier by 15 minutes each week, not all at once, and set a bedtime alarm to start winding down. Screens off 30 minutes before sleep helps a lot.\n\nProtect focus at work by planning food once weekly. Keep your rotation in a Google Keep note and your grocery cart pre-saved. If you want variety, swap one dinner per week; otherwise keep it boring and automatic. On a tough day, allow a “fallback” meal: eggs + toast + salad/cucumber, or curd rice with pickle. That’s still healthy and fast.\n\nA sample cadence: Sunday prep; Mon cook for Mon/Tue; Tue leftovers; Wed prep and cook for Wed/Thu; Thu leftovers; Fri super-quick meal or tiffin; Sat flexible. Track how long things actually take for a week—most people overestimate. The goal isn’t gourmet; it’s repeatable. Systems > willpower. After two weeks, keep what worked and drop what didn’t. You’ll buy back hours and headspace."

        "comment_o3": "What worked for me was attacking the problem from two angles: shrink the temptation window and give my brain a better‑quality break. First, make the phone slightly annoying to use. Log out of the social apps, bury them in a folder on the last screen, turn off all non‑essential notifications, and set the display to grayscale. If it takes an extra 10–15 seconds of friction to open Instagram, you’ll often decide it isn’t worth it. Second, decide ahead of time what “tired” you really means—do you need movement, stimulation, or just a pause? Pick a replacement activity you can start in under a minute: a five‑minute walk, ten push‑ups, a short guided breathing video on YouTube (downloaded so you don’t wander), or even standing up to stretch while listening to one song. Couple this with a timer like Pomodoro: work 25 minutes, then take a five‑minute intentional break that you’ve chosen in advance. When the break ends, phone goes face‑down in another room or desk drawer until the next cycle. Finally, track it. Each day note how many cycles you ran without scrolling—seeing the streak build is surprisingly motivating. You won’t be perfect, but every session you redirect is time you’ve reclaimed, and momentum compounds quickly once you have a few wins under your belt.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need more willpower, you need less friction when you’re focused and more structure when you’re tired. Here’s a simple setup that works.\n\nMake the phone a bad option during work. Remove social apps from your home screen or log out, turn on grayscale, and silence all non‑essential notifications. Use Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing to set app limits and Downtime during your work blocks. If you need extra help, apps like Freedom/Opal/One Sec add a pause or block entirely. Put the phone in another room while you work; charging it there is an easy habit anchor.\n\nDecide ahead of time what “break” means. When you feel tired, do a quick, pre-chosen reset: stand up, drink water, stretch, short walk, 10 deep breaths, or a 2‑minute tidy. Set a 5‑minute timer for the break, then back to the task. If you still want social, schedule it for a specific window later (e.g., 20–30 minutes after dinner). Knowing it’s planned makes it easier to skip in the moment.\n\nUse time blocks so the day doesn’t blur. Try 25/5 or 50/10 Pomodoros, phone out of reach. Keep a notepad for “urge captures” — when you want to check something, write it down and look during your social window.\n\nStart small and measure. Check your baseline screen time, then aim to cut 20–30 minutes this week. Replace that slot with a specific activity. Review nightly for one minute: what worked, what didn’t, adjust the limit.\n\nOne line to follow: “If I feel the urge to scroll, then I will stand up, drink water, set a 5‑minute timer, and pick a preset break.” Expect slip‑ups; just reset the next block. Consistency beats perfection. You’ve got this."

For anything that isn’t rent, bills, or groceries, impose a 48‑hour rule: you can add it to a wish list, but you can’t buy until two full days have passed. Nine times out of ten the urge fades and you never hit “checkout.” Delete saved cards from online stores, unsubscribe from promo emails, and leave your credit card at home when you don’t need it—those tiny bits of friction buy your rational brain a few extra seconds, which is usually enough. Finally, find a quick, free mood‑boosting activity you can default to when you feel the itch to shop: a short walk, a five‑minute meditation, a call to a friend, anything that changes your state without costing money. Combine automatic saving, forced cooling‑off periods, and a go‑to emotional outlet, and you’ll notice your impulse buys drop fast and your bank balance climb just as quickly.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Short version: make it harder to buy impulsively, easier to save automatically, and give yourself a small guilt‑free budget so you don’t rebound.\n\nPay yourself first. Set an automatic transfer on payday to a separate savings account (ideally at a different bank with no card). Rename it to your goal, like “Emergency Fund” or “Travel.” If the money leaves your checking before you see it, you don’t have to rely on willpower.\n\nGive every dollar a job, including fun. Make a simple zero‑based budget with a small “fun money” line you can spend on anything, guilt‑free. When that category is empty, you’re done. Track it in any app or even notes. This prevents the “I blew it, might as well keep spending” spiral.\n\nInsert a delay. Use a 48‑hour rule for wants under $50 and a 7‑day rule for bigger stuff. Park everything on a wishlist. Most items won’t survive the waiting period. If it still passes the test and your fun budget has room, buy it without guilt.\n\nAdd friction to shopping. Unsubscribe from promo emails, delete or hide shopping apps, log out of sites, remove saved cards from browsers, and turn off Apple/Google Pay. Keep only one card on you or use cash for discretionary spending. Even a tiny bit of hassle kills a lot of impulses.\n\nReplace the coping habit, don’t just remove it. Make an if‑then plan: “If I feel sad or angry and want to shop, I will set a 10‑minute timer and do X.” X can be a walk, shower, quick workout, journaling, texting a friend, or a 5‑minute tidy. Most urges peak and pass if you give them a minute.\n\nAdd a daily two‑minute money check‑in. Open your account, log yesterday’s spend, look at what’s left in “fun,” and close it. Do a five‑minute review once a week to plan the next few days. Put a sticky note in your wallet or a phone wallpaper that says, “Do I want this more than [my goal]?”\n\nCreate shopping rules. Only buy on one “purchase day” a week. One‑in, one‑out for physical items. No‑spend weekdays. If you still want it on purchase day and your fun money covers it, go for it.\n\nStart tiny so it sticks. This paycheck: auto‑transfer $20, delete one shopping app, and follow the 48‑hour rule. Stack from there.\n\nIf spending is creating debt you can’t get ahead of, consider a nonprofit credit counselor or a therapist for extra support. Nothing wrong with using more tools.\n\nYou don’t need perfect self‑control—just better defaults. Automate the good, slow down the bad, and give yourself a bit of planned joy. You’ve got this."

The good things long term are often unpleasant now and your brain steers you away from the \"pain\" associated with those.\n\nFor bad habits, it will take discipline, but there are some things you can do:\n\nAs you've pointed out, bad habits are almost always coping mechanisms. So what are the emotions, events and situations that are at the root? If you can tackle even some of those, you should see less of the bad behaviour. \n\nSecond, try to find an alternative. \n\nFor a better understanding: smoking and eating can help deal with stress. That goes back to prehistoric times when there was often danger. If you were eating, it was because you found a safe place to do so. Even today eating or smoking send signals to your brain like \"I'm eating/chewing, so I must be safe right now\" which helps against stress.\n\nChewing gum would give you a similar effect but without the bad consequences.\n\nAnd probably the easiest thing to start with, change your environment. What barriers can you put in place that make the bad behaviour harder to do or unpleasant? And how can you make the good choices easier to do?\n\nIt's gonna take time to break bad habits, but it should get better once you start seeing some results.",

Shrink the battlefield and win one skirmish at a time.\n\nAnchor on a single daily habit that gives the most return. Cooking one meal at home is a solid candidate: it saves cash, trims calories, and forces you into the kitchen instead of the drive‑thru. Decide what that meal is before you go to bed, lay the ingredients out, and promise yourself you can order Uber Eats only after you’ve eaten the food you made. Most days you won’t bother opening the app, and the money you would have spent can be moved into a separate “reward” account.\n\nAttach tiny add‑ons to things you already do. While coffee brews, knock out two minutes of body‑weight squats or push‑ups—adjust for the knee as needed. After brushing your teeth at night, set a five‑minute timer and put away whatever’s on the floor. When the timer dings, stop, even if the room isn’t perfect; consistency beats marathon cleaning sessions.\n\nMake bad habits inconvenient.

        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not failing because you “can’t choose better.” You’re trying to rely on willpower while tired, stressed, and surrounded by easy defaults. Make the better choice the easy one and the worse choice harder. Start tiny, stack wins, and let momentum do the heavy lifting.\n\nToday: go to sleep and protect 7–8 hours. You will make better choices once rested. Before bed, take 10 minutes to fill a trash bag and clear one surface, throw laundry in a hamper, lay out clothes/shoes for the morning, and put your keys/wallet by the door. Delete Uber Eats, remove your saved payment info, and move regular Uber to the last screen of your phone. Put a sticky note on your card: “No delivery this week.”\n\nFood: create a default meal you can make half-asleep. Example: rotisserie chicken, microwave rice, frozen veggies; or eggs + toast + fruit; or Greek yogurt + nuts + berries. Keep it mindless. Use an if-then rule: if I want to order, I eat my default meal first and wait 20 minutes. If I still want it after, fine. Most urges pass. Shop once for only your defaults and basics; stop buying aspirational perishables for now.\n\nCommute: pack your bag the night before and leave 15 minutes earlier. Set a rule: no morning Uber unless you’ll be late even if you walk out the door now. Removing the “I’ll figure it out in the morning” decision cuts most Uber rides.\n\nRoom: 10-minute reset every night. Start the timer, touch only visible trash/clothes/dishes. Stop when it beeps. Clean spaces make easier choices more likely.\n\nSmoking: for the next week, don’t try to quit; just track and delay. Log each cigarette and delay the first one by 10 minutes, then 15, then 20. Only smoke outside, never sitting. This builds reps of not immediately obeying an urge, which bleeds into food and apps too.\n\nMovement and knee: do the minimum every day. Ten minutes of low-impact: slow walk, gentle bike, or basic PT moves YouTube-verified for knee rehab. Think “grease the groove,” not workouts. Consistency first, intensity later.\n\nMoney: cancel any delivery subscriptions, set a daily cash cap for food, and move food spending to a separate debit card so Uber/delivery literally can’t use your main funds. Pay yourself first on payday (transfer to savings) so you don’t spend what isn’t there.\n\nThe gaming laptop: 30-day rule. Put it on a list. If you’ve hit your sleep, default meal, 10-minute tidy, and 10-minute movement for 21 of the next 30 days, revisit. If not, you just saved yourself cash and distraction.\n\nWrite this on paper and check it nightly: sleep 7–8, default meal first, no delivery this week, 10-min tidy, 10-min movement, delay cigarettes. If you miss, you’re not “back to zero.” Resume at the next opportunity. Post an update in a week with exactly how many days you hit each. Momentum beats motivation. You’ve got this."

        "comment_o3": "A good way to jump‑start your old discipline is to use the guitar as your anchor habit. Tell yourself you only have to pick it up for five minutes every single day. Five minutes is so small it’s almost impossible to skip, but once you’re holding the instrument you’ll usually play longer. Put the guitar on a stand in the middle of the room so it’s the first thing you see after work or school, and make a rule that you touch it before you touch your phone or the TV remote. Keep a notebook or a simple spreadsheet where you jot down what you practiced each day and how long you played—seeing a streak grow is motivating and makes skipping feel like breaking something valuable.\n\nOnce that five‑minute guitar streak feels automatic, piggyback another micro‑habit right after it—maybe ten push‑ups, a five‑minute walk around the block, or writing two sentences in a journal. The idea is to rebuild your discipline muscle with wins that are too small to fail, then gradually layer them until you’re back to a routine you’re proud of. If you ever fall off again, return to the five‑minute rule instead of beating yourself up. Consistency beats intensity, and tiny, locked‑in habits give you a foundation you can always rebuild on.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Swinging from “all-in” to “nothing” usually means the bar was set too high. The fix isn’t to summon more willpower, it’s to build a smaller on-ramp and stack easy wins.\n\nUse guitar as your keystone. Set a tiny daily floor and a reasonable ceiling: floor = 5 minutes, ceiling = 25 minutes. Same cue and time every day, e.g., right after dinner. Keep the guitar on a stand, pick and tuner visible, chair ready, phone on Do Not Disturb. When the cue hits, start a timer immediately—no negotiating.\n\nGive each session a simple structure so you never wonder what to do: 2 minutes warm-up (chromatic or finger exercises), 5–10 minutes on one focused skill (e.g., clean F chord, G–C changes, alternate picking), 5–10 minutes on a song section you enjoy, last minute recording a quick clip. End while it still feels doable. Progress comes from frequency more than duration.\n\nTrack and make it visual. Print a month calendar and X every practice day. Rule is “never miss twice.” If you’re tired, hit the 5-minute floor and call it a win. If you feel good, go to the ceiling, not beyond; leave some fuel in the tank so tomorrow isn’t harder. Do a weekly 30-second recording to hear progress—huge for motivation.\n\nAdd one general habit to support discipline, not five. Easiest is a 10-minute walk right after your practice, or 10 push-ups before you sit down with the guitar. It links “I show up” across domains and rebuilds the identity of someone who does small things consistently.\n\nExpect low-motivation days. Treat feelings as weather and the routine as your umbrella. Start the timer, touch strings for two minutes, and momentum will usually carry you. If it doesn’t, you still protected the streak.\n\nAfter two weeks, bump the floor to 10 minutes and keep the ceiling. After a month, pick one measurable guitar goal, like clean F chord five times in a row at 60 bpm or nailing the intro to a specific song. Clear “done” criteria make sessions feel purposeful.\n\nResources if you want structure: JustinGuitar’s beginner course or a simple YouTube playlist you repeat until bored. Fewer choices = less friction.\n\nYou don’t need to get back to “extreme.” Get back to “always.” Five minutes daily beats two hours sporadically, and it’s the fastest path to feeling disciplined again."

Or is it because I just don’t care enough about this business I’m working on. I’m amazed how people can work 6 hours a day of pure focused work. Sometimes I think there’s something wrong with me.\n\nWhen it comes to gym, eating healthy I can see those benefits immediately right after and feel good.

Write that down and look at it everyday. So, when you’re having a bad day and ask yourself “what the f am I doing this?” Your brain replies with the answer and continue.",
        "comment_o3": "Three hours of “pure work” sounds small on paper, but it’s a marathon if you’re not used to sustained focus. Most people who claim they can crank out six deep‑work hours got there by building up in small blocks, not by flipping a switch. Instead of lowering the daily goal, try reframing it: commit to one focused 25‑minute sprint, then decide whether to do another. Stack those sprints until you hit three hours or until you call it for the day. If you only manage two sprints, you still practiced the skill and logged exactly how long you lasted, so you have real data to beat tomorrow.\n\nMake the sessions easier to start. The night before, write down the single most specific task you’ll attack first—e.g., “Write introduction paragraph,” not “Work on website.” When you sit down, there’s zero decision fatigue; you just press play. Pair that with a short pre‑work ritual (brew coffee, put phone in another room, open only the files you need). Linking the ritual to the first sprint cues your brain that “this is work time,” the same way tying your shoes cues your brain it’s gym time.\n\nThe lack of immediate payoff is normal for knowledge work, so manufacture one. Keep a visible log of completed tasks or minutes—crossing them off provides the quick dopamine hit you get from a pump in the gym. Schedule a small, guilt‑free reward after your last sprint: a walk, a game, whatever. The brain starts associating the end of a work session with something pleasant, making the next session easier to initiate.\n\nAs for not caring about “making bank,” focus on the reason this business exists for you besides money. Is it learning a skill, earning freedom, solving a problem you find interesting? If you can’t identify a why that resonates, you may be forcing yourself toward a goal you don’t value, and no productivity hack will fix that. Either uncover a motivating purpose or pivot to work that does matter to you.\n\nFinally, expect fluctuation. Professional writers, developers, and academics have off days too; they just show up anyway and protect the habit. Treat each session as practice, not a performance. If you string together weeks of consistent 25‑minute blocks, you’ll look back and realize you’re already doing the three‑hour days you thought were impossible.",
        "comment_gpt5": "3 hours of pure focus isn’t “small.” For most people, true deep work caps at 3–4 hours on a good day. You’re not broken—you just sprinted Monday/Tuesday and crashed by Wednesday.\n\nSet a floor and a ceiling. Floor = one focused block you can hit even on bad days (start with 25–50 minutes). Ceiling = 3 hours. Protect the floor to build the streak; hit the ceiling only when you have gas. After a week or two, bump the floor by 10–15 minutes.\n\nMake the blocks boringly structured. Same time each day, ideally first thing. Two-minute setup: define the next concrete action (not “work on business,” but “draft 3 outreach emails” or “outline section 2”). Start a timer (25/5 or 50/10). Stop when the timer ends; take a real break; repeat.\n\nReduce friction aggressively. Phone in another room, website blocker on, one tab, full screen. Open the exact file before starting the timer. If you feel “mentally constipated,” use the 5-minute rule: commit to just five minutes—momentum usually shows up after you start.\n\nGive yourself immediate payoff like the gym. Keep a visible “done” list. After each block, stand up, quick walk, water, tiny treat—pair work with something that feels good. End the day with a 2-minute shutdown: write what you finished and what’s first tomorrow.\n\nIf money doesn’t move you, pick a weekly outcome you actually care about (publish a page, ship a draft, talk to one user) and tie it to what matters to you—skill growth, autonomy, helping someone. Spend your blocks on the highest-leverage task, not busywork, so progress is tangible.\n\nAlso test context: different time of day, new location, body doubling (Focusmate, library), short walk before block, reasonable caffeine, solid sleep. Do this for two weeks and reassess. If you still dread every minute, that’s data about the fit—not a character flaw—but test the process first.\n\nTL;DR: Don’t lower your ceiling; lower your minimum, make starting stupid-easy, and build consistency. One solid block every day beats heroic sprints and crash days."

When I walk in the door on Tuesday night I’m not debating what to make—I’m on autopilot. I aim for dinners that take 30 minutes max, dirty only one pan, and reheat well for lunch the next day. Think sheet‑pan chicken + veg, curry in an Instant Pot, or a sauté where canned beans replace half the chopping. I portion half straight into tomorrow’s lunch container while it’s still hot, so it never feels like “stale leftovers” sitting for four days.\n\nThe other trick is front‑loading the annoying parts. I wash and chop produce right after I unload the groceries, store it in clear containers, and measure out spice mixes into little jars. Weeknight cooking then feels like assembling a kit, not starting from scratch when my eyes are fried.\n\nFinally, pick a cue that signals “kitchen time” before exhaustion sets in. For me it’s changing clothes and starting a podcast the moment I shut the laptop. If I let myself sit on the couch first, game over.

        "comment_gpt5": "Cooking after screen-heavy days is less about willpower and more about having a system that makes “tired you” the easiest path. Two-prep weeks can work without the stale vibe if you prep components, not whole meals, and add a fresh element at serve-time.\n\nTry this for two weeks: Sunday and Wednesday, 60–90 minutes. Cook a protein or two (chicken thighs, tofu, turkey meatballs), a carb (rice/quinoa/potatoes), and a tray or two of veg (broccoli, peppers, carrots). Make one or two sauces (pesto, tahini-lemon, salsa, yogurt-garlic). Store everything separately and freeze half the protein and grains the same day so it never tastes old. On weeknights you’re assembling in 10 minutes: reheat a protein and veg in a pan, add a carb, finish with something fresh/crunchy/acidic (herbs, lemon, pickled onions, slaw, nuts). Bowls, tacos, wraps, stir-fries, and salads all work off the same base.\n\nBuild a 5–10 minute “after work reset” to help your eyes and get you moving: step outside or look far away (20-20-20), splash water on your face, do 10–20 bodyweight squats, drink a glass of water. Then apron on, music/podcast on, heat on. Make a simple rule: no sitting down until the pan or pot is on. Set a 20-minute “cook sprint” timer and race it.\n\nKeep a few healthy shortcuts so weekdays are frictionless: frozen veg, pre-cut veg, canned beans/lentils, microwaveable grains, rotisserie chicken. Line sheet pans with parchment, keep knives sharp, and clear the counter so starting is zero-hassle.\n\nDefault 10–15 minute dinners that aren’t junk: egg scramble/omelet with frozen veg + salsa; stir-fry frozen veg + pre-cooked protein + microwave rice + soy/ginger; canned tuna or chickpeas with cherry tomatoes + olive oil/lemon over greens; whole wheat pasta + jarred marinara + bagged salad; black bean and cheese quesadilla with cabbage slaw; air-fryer salmon (from freezer, ~12 min) + bagged salad. Slow cooker/Instant Pot also helps: load in the morning, dinner’s ready with almost no evening effort. If you batch something like chili/curry, freeze portions on day 0.\n\nPlan four weeknight dinners, shop once, and put them on your calendar so you don’t decide at 7pm. Set an alarm labeled “Start pan” when you log off. No screens while cooking—let that be your eye break.\n\nYou don’t need fancy. Protein + veg + carb + sauce is a win.

        "comment_o3": "Most people fall off because they rely on the rush of novelty instead of building a routine that survives low‑motivation days. Start by lowering the bar: decide what your “minimum viable workout” is—something so easy it feels almost silly (10 push‑ups, a 15‑minute jog, a few kettlebell swings). On days you feel great you can do the full session; on days you don’t, you still do the minimum and keep the habit chain intact. That stops a two‑day break from turning into two weeks.  \n\nSchedule your training like a meeting and build the logistics the night before: clothes laid out, water bottle filled, playlist or podcast queued. When the alarm goes off you’re on autopilot instead of negotiating with yourself.  \n\nUse an actual program with planned rest days and a deload week every 4–6 weeks. Programming takes the guesswork out and prevents the “all‑in until I crash” cycle. Tracking your lifts or run times in an app/notebook is another quiet motivator—seeing numbers creep upward makes you want to protect the streak.  \n\nIf you miss a day, just do the next scheduled workout. No extra punishment, no “starting over,” no guilt. The goal is to act like someone who works out, not someone chasing a perfect record. Consistency isn’t never missing; it’s resuming quickly after you do.  \n\nTreat the habit as identity (“I’m a morning lifter”) and logistics (“alarm at 5:30, gym at 6”) rather than willpower. Do that and the early sessions become as routine as brushing your teeth, and missing them starts to feel weirder than showing up.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Short answer: you’re going too hard the first few weeks and then your system has no off-ramp, so burnout = full stop. Build a plan that assumes motivation will dip and makes “light days” part of the program, not a failure.\n\nTry this: pick 3 early-morning days, same time every week. Do a simple full-body plan for 45–60 minutes and deliberately leave 1–2 reps in the tank on every lift. Run it in 4-week blocks: 3 normal weeks, then 1 deload week at ~60–70% of your usual volume/intensity. That deload week is what prevents the 2–3 week crash you described.\n\nSet a low floor and a show-up rule. On days you feel cooked or slept poorly, you still “train,” but it’s the minimum: 10 minutes brisk walking and 2 easy sets of squats, pushups, and rows, then leave. If you truly can’t get to the gym, do that at home. Never miss twice; if you miss a day, the next one is non-negotiable but can be the minimum.\n\nMake mornings frictionless. Go to bed on time because morning workouts actually start the night before. Clothes laid out, bag packed, alarm across the room, caffeine or water ready. Same playlist, same path to the door. Reduce decisions to zero.\n\nProgress slowly and avoid chasing PRs every session. Add 2.5–5 lb or 1–2 reps weekly at most. Rotate exercise variations every 4–6 weeks to reduce boredom and overuse. Track the habit, not just performance—check a calendar for “I showed up” and keep the chain going. Give yourself an immediate reward only after training (favorite coffee, podcast, sunrise walk home) to reinforce the loop.\n\nIf you fall off for a week, don’t try to “make up.” Restart with a deload-style week and resume the plan. If crowds are a problem, you’re already winning by going early—double down on that identity and protect that time like a meeting. Optional bonus: book a class, find a buddy, or pre-pay something with a cancellation fee to add accountability.\n\nConsistency beats intensity. Pick a floor you can hit on your worst days, schedule deloads before you need them, and let the weeks stack. The results come from boring, repeatable reps, not heroic bursts."

        "comment_o3": "The post‑meal crash is usually a mix of biology and habit. Around 1–3 p.m. your circadian rhythm naturally dips, and a big carb‑heavy lunch spikes insulin, shuttles tryptophan to the brain, and you get sleepy. If you’re already carrying some sleep debt, that dip feels like a brick wall. You can’t delete the biology, but you can blunt it enough to stay productive.\n\nFirst, audit the meal itself. Swap out huge portions of rice, bread, or pasta for more protein, veggies, and healthy fats, and keep the total calories reasonable. Chase it with a full glass of water—dehydration amplifies fatigue. If you’re a coffee drinker, have the cup right after eating; caffeine takes ~20 minutes to kick in, lining up nicely with the dip.\n\nSecond, move immediately. Stand up the moment you finish the last bite and take a 5–10 minute brisk walk, ideally outside for sunlight. The combo of light and movement tells your brain it’s still “go” time and evens out blood glucose.\n\nThird, give yourself a controlled outlet. A 15–20 minute “permission nap” (set an alarm, lie on the couch, not the bed) can recharge without letting you drift into a full sleep cycle. If you’re afraid you’ll over‑snooze, hold a pen or your phone loosely—when it drops, you wake up.\n\nFourth, safeguard the environment. Keep study materials in a different room, or leave the house entirely for a library/coffee shop sprint session after lunch. When the bed isn’t within arm’s reach, the friction of going back to it often overrides the impulse.\n\nFinally, check the foundation: 7–9 hours of consistent nighttime sleep, same wake‑up time daily, and no marathon bedtime phone scrolling. When nightly rest is solid, the afternoon slump becomes a speed bump instead of a ditch.\n\nTweak one variable at a time for a week so you know what’s actually helping, then stack the wins. You probably won’t erase the dip completely, but you can shrink it from 60 lethargic minutes to a quick reset and get on with your day.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Totally normal. There’s a real circadian dip early afternoon, and a big/fast-carb lunch, low movement, dim light, dehydration, or poor sleep the night before will amplify it.\n\nMake it a routine problem, not a willpower one. Plan a post‑lunch script you run every day: finish eating → drink a full glass of water → 10–15 minute brisk walk outside or at least bright light → sit down somewhere that isn’t your bed and start the easiest task on your list for 10 minutes. Put a timer on it. The goal is to bridge the 20–30 minute window where your body wants to crash.\n\nTweak lunch: smaller portion, more protein/fiber/veggies, fewer refined carbs and heavy fats. Consider splitting lunch into two smaller meals a couple hours apart. Track what you eat for a week and note energy 30–90 minutes after—patterns show up fast.\n\nIf you really need rest, keep it to a 10–20 minute power nap, not 30–60 (that hits deep sleep and makes you groggy). A “caffeine nap” can help: drink a small coffee, lie down immediately for 15 minutes; the caffeine kicks in as you wake. Cut caffeine after ~2–3 pm so your nighttime sleep stays solid.\n\nAdd friction to the bed habit: make the bed right after breakfast, leave the bedroom, put a chair or folded blanket on the bed so you don’t “just lie down for a minute.” Work from a different spot post‑lunch if you can, or stand for the first 20 minutes back.\n\nAlso cover the basics: consistent 7–9 hours, morning sunlight, and hydration. If you’re sleeping enough, eating lighter, moving after lunch, and you still get overwhelming sleepiness, consider talking to a doctor to rule out anemia, thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or blood sugar problems.\n\nTry this tomorrow: eat half your usual lunch, drink 500 ml water, 10‑minute walk, sit somewhere away from your bed, and do 10 minutes of an easy task. That small sequence, done consistently, beats the slump better than brute forcing it."

The guitar session can live later as a wind‑down. After those two slots, whatever time’s left is guilt‑free: read, watch TV, whatever.

It signals the day job is done and helps you walk into the next task with more energy.  \n\nTrack progress weekly, not daily: “Did I hit four French sessions and four guitar sessions this week?” Checking boxes daily can crush motivation when life happens, but a weekly score lets you stay flexible.  \n\nFinally, cap your idea intake. Keep a running “later” list for courses, books, and business ideas so they’re not rattling in your head demanding attention. Every quarter when you review goals, you can promote one item from the list and demote another. That way you’re always learning, always practicing, and never drowning in choices.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t have a time problem so much as a prioritizing/decision problem. The fix is to stop trying to “do everything a little” and work in seasons. For the next 12 weeks, pick one primary focus and one maintenance habit. Everything else goes on a Later List you’ll revisit next season. You’re not quitting interests—you’re sequencing them.\n\nGive the primary 60–90 min on weeknights plus one longer weekend block; give the maintenance habit 15–30 min most days. Example: Primary = French (finish X workbook, 1 italki session/week). Maintenance = instrument scales or 20 min writing. Next season you can swap: Primary = instrument repertoire or startup validation; Maintenance = French reviews.\n\nPre-decide your weekday evenings so there’s no choice at 8 pm. After dog/chores, do a 10–15 min reset (shower, snack, stretch), then 8:00–9:00 primary focus, 9:00–9:30 maintenance, 9:30–10:30 chill/TV/reading, 10:30 wind down, lights out by 11. Rule: no TV until the first two blocks are done. Phone in another room, timer on, blockers on. You’ll be amazed how much 60 focused minutes beats three scattered hours.\n\nOn low-energy days, do the “tiny version” and call it a win: 10 min of Anki, one French podcast on the dog walk, one page of writing, 10 min of scales. Keep your streak alive, then go rest guilt-free.\n\nFor the startup, treat it as a structured experiment, not a second job. Reserve a 2–3 hour Saturday morning block. Concrete goal for the first month: validate a problem by talking to 10–15 potential customers and writing what you learn. No LLC or logo until you’ve got signal.\n\nStack what you can: French podcasts/audiobooks on walks, ear training apps while making dinner, reading as your wind-down. Only one course at a time. Rotate interests quarterly so everything gets its season.\n\nDo a 20-minute Sunday plan: choose the week’s sub-goals, schedule them into specific days, and set up the next action for Monday night. Put the remote in a drawer, turn off autoplay, and make TV something you start on purpose after the work block.\n\nRun this as a two-week experiment, then adjust. One primary, one maintenance, pre-decided blocks, tiny versions on tired days. That’s how you turn 3–4 hours into real progress without burning out."

I love staying awake at night, and I naturally tend to fall asleep around 2 to 3 AM and wake up around 10-11AM feeling well-rested. But lately I’ve really had a desire to try to become a morning person so that I can be more productive throughout the day. Do you guys have any tips on how you wake up early, like 6 AM? How do you force yourself out of bed when all you feel like doing is sleeping for “five more minutes.”\n\nEdit: just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to contribute such helpful comments!

Over the past year I’ve decided to get my life in order. Didn’t especially focus on my sleep schedule issues, but on my general well being. I listen to my body more, I rest more and quit drinking, I take the time to do painting / drawing, whatever creative activity calms me down. Cut out all social media except for Reddit sometimes, never at night. I started feeling more relaxed in the evenings, and I came to enjoy reading a book at 10pm as much as I used to enjoy binge watching Netflix all night. Being far from screens, I get tired, I fall asleep. Naturally, I wake up earlier and earlier every week, step by step. \n\nMy point is, I’ve used every technic I could find to become a morning person before, and it never worked (I was late EVERY day to my job for 4 years). It is only when I started taking care of myself globally and on a more spiritual level too that it has changed. Feeling good and proud about yourself is the best way to actually want to get out of bed and face the day.",

        "comment_o3": "I used to be on the 2 a.m.–10 a.m. schedule too, and the thing that finally stuck was treating the wake‑up time as an immovable appointment while changing the environment around it.\n\nPick one time—say 6 a.m.—and get out of bed at that time every single day for three weeks, weekends included. When the alarm goes off, stand up, turn on bright lights, splash your face, and open a window or step outside for a couple of minutes. Morning light is the strongest signal to your body clock; the earlier you hit it, the sooner you’ll start getting sleepy at night.\n\nBecause “willpower in the dark” isn’t reliable, prep the night before. Put the alarm across the room, set out clothes, fill the kettle, and have something you actually look forward to waiting—good coffee, a playlist, a quick walk with a friend. Tiny rewards beat mental negotiations.\n\nShift the bedtime gradually: aim to feel drowsy 30 minutes earlier every few nights. Cut caffeine after early afternoon, dim lights and screens an hour before bed, keep the room cool and dark. One late Netflix binge can reset the whole experiment, so try to stay consistent even on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe first week is rough, the second is tolerable, and by the third your brain usually gives in. Stick it out and you’ll wake up before the alarm wondering why you ever thought 6 a.m. was early.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t have to flip from 2–3 AM to 6 AM overnight. Shift your clock, not just your alarm. Pick a non‑negotiable wake time that’s only 15–30 minutes earlier than what you do now, hold it for 3–4 days, then move it earlier again. Keep the wake time the same 7 days a week. Protect a full sleep window so you’re not just cutting sleep; your bedtime will naturally slide earlier after a few days of consistent early wakes.\n\nLock in morning light and movement. Within 10–30 minutes of waking, get outside for 5–10 minutes or use a bright light box if it’s dark. Light is the biggest lever for shifting your internal clock. Add a quick “feet on floor” routine: alarm across the room, lights on, bathroom, splash cold water, drink water, step outside. Tell yourself you only need to be up for five minutes; once you’re up, it’s easier to stay up.\n\nMake evenings cue “wind down.” Set a nightly shutdown alarm 90–120 minutes before target bedtime. Dim lights, cut screens or use strong blue‑light filters, stop caffeine 8–10 hours before bed, keep late alcohol and big meals to a minimum. Do the same wind‑down sequence each night (shower, stretch, read a paper book). Prep the morning: clothes out, coffee maker ready, shoes by the door.\n\nSnooze‑proof your wake. Use a sunrise alarm or two alarms (one by the bed, one across the room). Pair waking with something you genuinely look forward to that you only allow in the morning—favorite coffee, a podcast you love, sunlight walk. If “five more minutes” is your trap, commit to a no‑snooze streak and track it on a calendar; missing once is fine, don’t miss twice.\n\nExpect a rough first week or two; that’s normal. Don’t compensate by sleeping in—keep the wake time and go to bed earlier the next night. Short power nap before 2 PM is okay during the transition if you’re wrecked, but keep it under 20 minutes.\n\nIf after 3–4 weeks of consistent cues and enough sleep you still feel awful at 6 AM, move the target a bit later. Productivity comes from a stable routine that fits your chronotype more than a specific hour on the clock. But with gradual shifts, light, and good wind‑down habits, most night owls can get to an earlier, workable wake‑up. You’ve got this."

        "best_comment": "You gotta fix your schedule, there's no way around it, even your free time needs to be scheduled. The main tip to wake up early is to sleep early and always the same time, including weekends, in a few days you'll naturally wake up the same hour everyday, the problem is that usually when our system is understanding our new routine we screw up during the weekend.   \nTalking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   \nIn a few days you'll love your new routine and you'll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don't have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there's always a little windows to stick something new you want to try. Be curious, test it, try new things, improvise but always follow your schedule, I like to organize my week during my sunday, this way I know exactly what have to be done in the following days, including when I'll rest.",

        "comment_o3": "I’d stop worrying about the 5 a.m. club for now and build a repeatable “after‑work block” instead. Pick a start cue you can’t miss—say, the moment you set your keys down at home—and lock in a fixed 90‑minute chain: 30 min workout, 20 min dog walk (counts as cooldown), quick shower, then 40 min to cook dinner. Treat that block like an un‑skippable meeting: prep gym clothes and the leash near the door before you leave for work so there’s zero friction when you arrive. Once this is running on autopilot three to four times a week, add a short hobby session right after dinner. Keep it tiny at first, like ten minutes of guitar scales or a language lesson; consistency matters more than duration early on.\n\nIf you still want mornings later, approach it the same way—shift bedtime 15 minutes earlier every few days, keep the bedroom dark and cool, put the alarm across the room, and give yourself a guaranteed reward (good coffee, a podcast you enjoy) that only happens when you get up. But earn that upgrade by nailing the simpler after‑work routine first. Momentum is discipline’s best friend.",
        "comment_gpt5": "If waking early is your biggest sticking point, stop fighting mornings for now. You can get a solid routine going after work and move it earlier later if you still want.\n\nSet one fixed “start trigger” for weekdays: as soon as you get home, put your bag down, plug your phone to charge in another room, start a 5‑minute timer, then leash the dog when it ends. No couch or scrolling before that. Treat the dog walk as your warm‑up: 15–25 minutes, brisk pace. Back home, change and do 20–30 minutes of a simple full‑body routine (3 moves works: push, pull, legs). Shower, then cook from a tiny rotation of 3 easy dinners you preplanned on Sunday. After eating, spend 20 minutes on your hobby. Everything after that is free time.\n\nMake the “minimum standard” version for low‑energy days so you keep the streak: 10‑minute dog loop, 1 set of each exercise, eggs + bagged salad or a freezer meal, 5 minutes on the hobby. Streaks count only if the minimum is done.\n\nReduce friction ahead of time. Leash and shoes by the door, workout clothes laid out, ingredients prepped or delivered, hobby materials open on your desk. Decide once a week which three evenings you’ll work out and what you’ll cook; put them on your calendar with reminders. A simple checklist on the fridge keeps you honest.\n\nIf you eventually want mornings, move your wake time 15 minutes earlier every 3–4 days, lock in a consistent bedtime, get bright light on your eyes within 10 minutes of waking, and put the alarm across the room. But you don’t need to be a morning person to be disciplined—consistency beats timing. Start with two weeks of the after‑work template and adjust from there."

Ninety percent of the time those two minutes turn into a full session and flow shows up; the other ten percent I still get the rep and keep the streak alive.  \n\nBefore bed I set the stage: gear laid out, doc open, phone out of reach.

        "comment_gpt5": "Biggest shift for me was stopping the hunt for “flow” and building a reliable start ritual. Flow shows up after you’ve been focused for a bit; your job is to make starting almost automatic.\n\nPick one habit and anchor it to a precise cue: when X happens, I do Y at place Z. Example: after coffee at 7:30, sit at the same desk, put on the same playlist, start a 25‑minute timer, and do the smallest possible first action (open the doc and write one ugly sentence; open the textbook and do problem 1; put on shoes and step out the door). Same cue, same place, same soundtrack. That consistency trains your brain that “we’re doing this now.”\n\nLower the bar so it’s daily. Define a minimum that “counts” even on bad days: 2 minutes of writing, one page, one set, one equation. If life hits, do the minimum and keep the chain alive. Don’t miss twice.\n\nMake the environment do the heavy lifting. Set everything out the night before. Phone in another room. One browser tab. Use a site blocker during your block. Keep a “parking lot” notepad to dump random thoughts so you don’t task‑switch.\n\nAim for clear, bite‑sized goals each session so your brain gets quick feedback: finish exercise 1–3, outline section A, review Anki deck 1. Slightly challenging, not overwhelming. That challenge‑skill balance is what nudges you into flow.\n\nClose each session by writing tomorrow’s exact next step. This removes friction at the next start and compounds momentum. Track it visibly and protect the streak.\n\nIf you want extra juice, add light accountability: text a friend “start/done,” join a virtual coworking session, or schedule the block on your calendar like a meeting.\n\nTry this for a week: one fixed trigger, one tiny minimum, a 25‑minute block, same ritual every day. Flow will visit more often once your start becomes non‑negotiable."

        "comment_o3": "The drowsiness usually isn’t a will‑power problem, it’s a systems problem, so tweak the system first. Aim for a true 7–8 hours of sleep in one block; for most people that means lights out around 10:30 pm if you’re logging back on at 9 am. Give yourself a 30‑minute wind‑down without screens so you’re actually asleep when you think you are. When you wake up, get bright light and a glass of water immediately. Hold off on the first coffee for 60–90 minutes; that lets your natural cortisol wake you up first and keeps the crash away.\n\nThe 11 am slump is often blood sugar. Keep breakfast protein‑heavy and go easy on simple carbs at lunch. Think chicken/veg, not a big bowl of pasta. Right after eating, walk around the block or do a quick set of push‑ups; a couple of minutes of movement blunts the post‑meal crash better than more caffeine.\n\nUse the fact you’re WFH: stand for calls, stretch every hour, open the curtains. Tiny movement breaks keep circulation up and stop the “office‑chair coma.” If you’re still nodding off, schedule a 15‑minute power nap before 2 pm—set an alarm, lie down, eyes closed. It’s surprisingly effective and won’t wreck nighttime sleep.\n\nOn study time, pick one primary slot and protect it. If you’re a night owl, shut the work laptop at 7:30 pm sharp, grab dinner, then study 8:30–10 pm. If you’re wiped by then, flip it: study 7:30–8:45 am, log in to work at 9. Either way, time‑box it and treat it like a meeting. Weekends become your longer, deeper study blocks so weekdays only need maintenance sessions.\n\nFinally, audit your work hours. Many remote gigs sprawl because we let them. Decide on a finish time, tell coworkers you’ll reply next day, and log off. A hard stop gives your brain permission to switch modes, which makes both studying and sleeping easier.\n\nDial in sleep, food, light, and boundaries first; discipline gets a lot easier when the body isn’t fighting you every few hours. Good luck—you’ll feel a difference in a week of consistent tweaks.",
        "comment_gpt5": "A lot of what you’re describing are normal energy dips (late morning, post‑lunch, late evening), which get amplified by long, screen‑heavy WFH days. The fix is less “try harder” and more “engineer your day.”\n\nFirst, nail sleep basics for 2–3 weeks: same wake/bed time every day, shoot for 7.5–8.5 hours, dark/cool room, no screens the last 60 minutes, and cut caffeine 8–10 hours before bed (for most people that’s no later than ~2 p.m.). Get outside light within an hour of waking for 5–10 minutes; it does more than coffee for alertness.\n\nSecond, manage the dips on purpose. Late‑morning and after‑lunch slumps: short movement every hour (60–90 seconds of squats/pushups or a brisk walk to the mailbox), and a 10–15 minute walk right after lunch. Keep lunch lighter with protein/veg/fat and fewer refined carbs to avoid the crash. If you’re still dragging, a 15–20 minute power nap between 12:30–2:30 can be gold. A “coffee nap” (drink coffee, nap 15 min) can carry you through the afternoon without wrecking night sleep.\n\nThird, match tasks to energy. Do your most cognitively heavy work when you’re naturally sharper (usually early morning). Push meetings/admin to your 11 a.m. dip if you can. Work in cycles like 50/10 or 90/20 and actually stand up on the breaks.\n\nFor studies, stop trying to squeeze it into the sleepiest part of your day. Pick one high‑quality block when you’re alert: either 60–90 minutes before 9 a.m. or a focused 30–45 minutes right after work following a brisk walk. Decide the exact task the night before (“Chapter 3, problems 1–6” or “watch lecture 2, take 1 page of notes”) and set a minimum baseline so you win even on tired days (e.g., 20 minutes or one page). If weekdays are tight, do one longer anchor block on the weekend to reduce weekday pressure.\n\nMake the environment do some work for you: bright light in the morning, cooler room, standing desk or chair that encourages posture changes, water bottle nearby, and website blockers during study blocks. Put these on your calendar like meetings; protect them.\n\nIf you’re still unusually sleepy after consistent 7–9 hours and the above for a few weeks, consider medical basics (snoring/apnea, low iron/ferritin, thyroid, B12) with a doctor.\n\nTL;DR sample day: wake 6:45, sunlight + 10‑min walk, study 7:15–8:15, work 9–12, walk + light lunch, 15‑min nap, work 1–5 in cycles, admin 5–7, short walk, light dinner, wind‑down 60 min, asleep ~10:45. Adjust times to your reality, but keep the structure. Discipline here is mostly systems and timing, not willpower."

Make the first step almost embarrassingly small: open the doc and write one sentence, do two push‑ups, whatever. Once in motion you’ll usually keep going, and even if you don’t, you kept the promise and protect the streak. Track the streak on paper; a row of X’s is surprisingly persuasive. End each session mid‑stride—jot the very next action before you leave so tomorrow’s start is automatic. Finally, add friction to the escape hatches: phone in another room, blocker on distracting sites, timer running.

        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t have a motivation problem; you have a system problem. Right now you’re relying on feelings and vague promises to “do it tomorrow.” Replace that with specifics and low bars.\n\nStop promising “later.” Either touch the task for 5 minutes now or make a concrete if-then plan for tomorrow: “At 7:30pm, at my desk, I’ll open X, do Y for 10 minutes, phone in the other room.” Put it on your calendar with an alarm. Write the exact first action so there’s zero thinking required.\n\nUse a floor, not a ceiling. Commit to the smallest version that moves it forward (100 words, 10 minutes, 1 problem). Anything extra is bonus. The win is showing up. Consistency builds self-trust a lot faster than big, sporadic bursts.\n\nTimebox with a visible timer. Start, no negotiation, and stop when the timer ends. End the session before you feel “done” and leave a breadcrumb: a one-line note of what you’ll do next and lay out the materials. That kills the “high” that leads to drift and makes re-entry easy.\n\nAssume future-you will bail unless there’s friction. Prep the environment so starting is effortless and distractions are costly: tabs closed, blocker on, phone in another room, document already open. Add accountability if you need it: text a friend a start/stop photo, join a body-doubling session (Focusmate), or use a commitment contract (Beeminder/StickK).\n\nSeparate planning from doing. Pick your “one must-do” the night before, with the exact start time and first action. In the moment, you just execute the plan, not renegotiate it.\n\nWhen you miss, don’t spiral; do the minimum next available slot. The rule is “never miss twice,” not “never miss.”\n\nExample: Tonight write “Tomorrow 7:30–7:50pm: open Chapter 2 doc, write 100 words. Phone in kitchen. After, jot next sentence.” Do that for a week. Your brain learns that when you say “tomorrow,” it actually happens, and the loop breaks."

I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.\n\n**Two minors issues**\n\n* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \\--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).\n* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \\--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)  \n \n\n**My two biggest issues**\n\n* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \\--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking \"ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?\" and the thought really really scares me.  \n \n* **Dating** \\--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think \"Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?\" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).  \n \n\n**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",

If you’re dissatisfied now that means you need to take whatever small things you can start TODAY and go from there. It takes such a long time to make active changes in your life no matter how small or low you aim you need to start today. In my experience nothing has ever been a quantum leap but rather constant tiny changes in my “right now” decision making.",

If you are not truly satisfied with all aspects of ur life then give dating a miss for the time being and focus competent on YOU. \nThere’s a lot more I would like to say but I advise you take a day off and binge watch these 2 you tubers:\n\n“Hamza” and “first man”\n\nThese 2 will rework your mindset and set you on a good path for self improvement\n\nGood luck G and see you on the other side",
        "comment_o3": "I’d zoom out and think in terms of a “one‑knob at a time” approach. When you try to twist four or five knobs simultaneously (gym, alcohol, porn, dating, school) you run out of willpower fast, relapse on one, then feel like the whole panel exploded. Pick the single habit that would make everything else easier and nail it for 60‑90 days. For most people in your situation that’s consistent exercise because it’s an anchor: it floods you with endorphins, regulates sleep, gives you something to do when urges hit, and grows self‑respect. Your plan can be as simple as three strength workouts and two 30‑minute walks per week, booked on your calendar like classes you can’t skip. When you’re sick or busy, keep the streak alive with an ultra‑tiny version—five minutes of push‑ups or stretching counts. The goal is “never zero,” not “perfect session.” Once that’s automated you’ll be surprised how much easier it is to drink less, study better, and resist porn because your brain already has a daily win.\n\nFor alcohol, decide your rule before you enter the bar: “no drinks” or “two and done.” Announce it to the friend who will actually call you on it, not the one who buys rounds. Order a soda with lime as soon as you arrive so your hands aren’t empty. Track nights alcohol‑free on a calendar; watching a streak grow scratches the same dopamine itch drinking used to.\n\nPorn is a stimulus‑response loop like any other. Remove the stimulus (blockers, phone out of bedroom, no screens after 11), replace the response (cold shower, short walk, text a friend) and expect withdrawal waves for two weeks. When you slip—and you will—label it data, not failure. Note the trigger, adjust the environment, start the streak counter at one again. That mental reset is the real skill you’re practicing.\n\nDating can wait. You’re about to switch countries twice; that’s enough novelty. Give yourself permission to focus on friendships, study, and the habits above until you land in the exchange semester. Loneliness won’t kill you; chasing new matches while you’re unstable might. If someone amazing crosses your path organically, great, but deleting the apps removes the “should I swipe?” bandwidth tax and lets you prove to yourself that you can be content solo.\n\nFinally, therapy usually feels unproductive right before the real work starts. If you can afford it, commit to another ten sessions and treat it like training, not chatting. Show up with a written agenda of what happened, what you tried, what didn’t work. That alone makes it feel practical.\n\nTL;DR: pick exercise as your keystone habit, guard it like a class, layer in alcohol rules, treat porn slips as data, pause the dating apps, and give therapy another structured shot. Stack small, repeatable wins and the darker thoughts lose their grip. You’ve got good resources; now turn them into daily reps.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’ve already started turning the ship: you cut way back on alcohol, you’re in the gym, you’re reflecting instead of numbing. Now give yourself a clear season to build a base. For the next 60–90 days, simplify and focus on a few keystone behaviors you can carry through travel and schedule changes.\n\nFor body/fitness, make the habit stupid-easy to keep when life gets busy. Pre-commit to a minimum program you can do anywhere: three full‑body sessions a week, daily walking, and a protein/veggie target. When sick or slammed, do “maintenance mode” instead of skipping: a 20‑minute walk, a few sets of bodyweight moves, early bedtime. Use the never-miss-twice rule. If school starts, your plan doesn’t change, only the time slot does—put sessions in your calendar like classes.\n\nFor weight, pick one simple lever. Either track calories for two weeks to learn your numbers, or use rules like protein with every meal, eat mostly whole foods, and no liquid calories. Aim for slow loss; fast loss invites rebound.\n\nFor alcohol, set one bright-line rule for this season. Either go zero, or something like a two‑drink cap and no alcohol at home. Tell friends you’re on a health kick so you don’t negotiate with yourself in the moment. Order a non‑alcoholic drink first to make it automatic.\n\nFor porn/masturbation, stop making it a forever decision and make it a today decision. Build a system, not a streak. Change the environment (blockers on all devices, no phone in bed/bathroom, keep doors open when on a laptop), and have an if‑then plan: if an urge hits, then I start a 10‑minute timer, leave the room, do 20 pushups or a cold rinse, and text a friend or go for a walk. Track urges surfed, not just days “clean.” If you slip, do a quick post‑mortem (when/where/why), patch the hole, and resume the plan the same day. If going totally abstinent feels paralyzing, set a 30‑day experiment, then reassess with what you learned.\n\nDating-wise, with two moves coming, consider a deliberate pause. Delete the apps for 30–60 days and put that time into sleep, training, study, and friends. You won’t miss out; you’ll show up to the next chapter more stable and attractive. If you keep dating, cap it (e.g., one date a week) and timebox swiping so it doesn’t eat your bandwidth.\n\nTherapy is a practice, not a chat. Go back and give it 8–12 sessions with an agenda: compulsive porn use, alcohol boundaries, relationship patterns, coping skills when lonely. If sessions feel aimless, say that and ask for CBT/ACT‑style tools. Bring notes from your week so you always have something to work on.\n\nGive your days a simple frame: consistent sleep/wake, 10 minutes each morning to plan your top three tasks, two focused study blocks, one movement session, and a 5‑minute evening check‑in where you score habits and prep tomorrow. Track compliance weekly and adjust the plan to hit 80% consistently rather than aiming for 100% and crashing.\n\nLast thing: if those dark thoughts ever come back, reach out—to a professional, a hotline in your country, or someone you trust. Needing help is normal, especially while you’re rebuilding.\n\nTiny wins > perfect days. Stack them and the rest follows. You’ve got this."

      "body": "For the past two years, I have been sleeping, dreaming about me being a sissy and pleasuring different people I have met and am friends with. I have been watching porn with the perspective of me being the woman and not the man. Too much sissy porn has affected me so seriously in my brain. I have been watching Hypnos, BNWO videos on Twitter, Reddit and on many other websites. It has reprogrammed me into thinking I am never going to be a man who could bang like in the video, or be a man who could achieve anything. I am always going to be the girl.\n\nThe worst thing about this addiction is that I don’t sleep unless I dream about getting fucked. Whenever I think about being the dude in sex, I stay up all night. But the moment I think about me getting plowed by a dick, I sleep like a baby.\n\nThis thinking is severely affecting my career. Me, doing a master’s in finance, have to give a lot of presentations. Since watching sissy porn, my confidence has dropped a lot, and I am shy all the time. My manhood is being affected by this type of porn.\n\nI am unable to be the focus on my studies as well. I am so attracted to this type of porn that I have started missing my online lectures, or I watch porn during the lectures on my phone.\n\nI don’t know how to cope up with this addiction. Can anyone help me spiral out of this hypnotic porn?",

We cant control the experiences that bring us to these fantasies but its important that we accept them for what they are - enjoyable fantasies. \n\nYour manhood is not deteriorating because of your fantasies. Its deteriorating because you can’t accept yourself and the lack of confidence shows.\n\nA sex therapist would the best place to help you.",
        "comment_o3": "First, treat this the same way you’d treat any compulsion that’s hijacking your time: remove easy access, add friction, and fill the vacuum with something that actually moves your life forward. Start tonight by wiping all saved porn from your phone and laptop, unfollowing the Twitter subs, and installing a blocker like Cold Turkey or BlockSite on every device. Give a friend the password or use a random one‑time generator so you can’t bypass it in a weak moment.\n\nNext, swap the bedtime cue. Right now arousal equals sleep because you’ve trained your brain that way. Pick a different, non‑sexual wind‑down ritual and commit to it for thirty nights. A paper book in bed, guided breathing on YouTube, or even boring finance articles will do—anything that tells your brain, “It’s sleep time, not porn time.” Go to bed and wake up at fixed hours, no screens in the bedroom, and caffeine only before noon. It’ll be rough for a week or two, then the new cue starts sticking.\n\nDaytime urges hit hardest when you’re idle or stressed. Keep the phone out of reach in lectures, take handwritten notes, and set 25‑minute focus blocks with a five‑minute stretch break. If the urge shows up, stand up, do ten push‑ups, breathe deep, and get back to work. Physical interruption breaks the loop.\n\nConfidence won’t magically return, but it does grow with reps. Lift weights three times a week, join Toastmasters or volunteer to read the next case study aloud, and track every small win in a notebook. Seeing proof that you can shape your body and speak in public starts dismantling the “I’m always the girl” narrative.\n\nIf the fantasies still dominate, find outside accountability. A kink‑aware therapist, SAA meetings, or the communities on r/pornfree and r/nofap are built for exactly this. You’re not broken; you’re caught in a reinforced habit loop, and thousands have climbed out of the same hole.\n\nExpect slips. When they happen, don’t spiral—log what triggered it, tighten your defenses, and keep the streak going. Give yourself 90 sober days and you’ll be shocked at how different your brain, sleep, and self‑image feel. Keep grinding—you’ve got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not broken. Your brain got conditioned by a very specific stimulus loop. That can be unlearned, but it takes structure and time. Think in two tracks: 1) break the sleep/porn association, 2) rebuild daytime focus and confidence.\n\nFirst, sleep. Create a boring, consistent pre-bed routine that doesn’t include any erotic content: 60–90 minutes before bed, screens off or at least no social feeds, shower, light stretch, paper book, dim lights. If you’re lying in bed and your mind goes straight to sexual fantasy, get out of bed, sit in a chair, breathe slowly, read a dull book for 10–15 minutes, then try again. This is stimulus control: bed is only for sleep. Add basics that make sleep easier without porn: morning sunlight, exercise earlier in the day, no caffeine after noon, cool dark room, white noise, and a simple wind-down script (box breathing or body scan). Expect the first week to be rough; it gets easier as your brain stops tying sleep to porn.\n\nSecond, cut the supply. Make it hard to “accidentally” open anything. Remove Twitter/Reddit from your phone or log out and change passwords to long random strings stored in a manager you can’t access on mobile. Install a blocker like Freedom or Cold Turkey with scheduled locks that cover your high-risk hours (late night, during lectures, before presentations). Use a DNS filter like CleanBrowsing Family on your devices/router. Put your phone in another room at night and during lectures. The goal is friction: when the urge hits, there’s just enough delay to choose differently.\n\nHave an urge plan. When the urge spikes, set a 10-minute timer and surf it: breathe, notice the sensations, don’t engage the story. Cravings peak and fade within minutes if you don’t feed them. Pair that with a replacement routine: leave the room you’re in, splash water on your face, do 20 squats or a brisk 5-minute walk, then do one tiny productive action (open slides, outline one point, or read one page). Track urges and what helped; treat lapses as data, not drama.\n\nRebuild study habits with constraint. For lectures, sit up front, phone off and out of sight, and take handwritten notes. For self-study, two 50–90 minute deep-work blocks per day are enough if protected: blockers on, only the materials you need open, a visible timer, and a simple checklist of 3–5 tasks. If you’re watching lectures, do it in a public spot or library where you won’t open other tabs. Tie internet freedom to task completion: no social apps until your blocks are done.\n\nConfidence for presentations comes from reps. Every day, record a 3–5 minute talk on any topic, review it, and tweak one thing (pace, eye contact with the camera, pauses). Before live presentations, do three out-loud run-throughs standing up. Consider Toastmasters if you can. Also, a few minutes of calm breathing and a power stance before you present helps your nervous system more than trying to “think your way” into confidence.\n\nMindset matters. Fantasies don’t define your worth or your capability. The goal isn’t to police identity; it’s to get out of a compulsive loop that’s hijacking your time and confidence. If you choose to keep any sexual content, set deliberate boundaries (e.g., no hypno or brainwash-style content, no porn on phone, only at specific times, not before bed). Many people find a 30-day porn-free reset helpful to let arousal patterns cool off.\n\nIf this feels bigger than self-help, look for a therapist who is kink-aware and experienced with compulsive sexual behavior. That’s not a moral judgment; it’s like hiring a coach for a stubborn habit. Accountability also helps: tell one trusted friend your plan and send them a daily two-sentence check-in.\n\nMake it concrete for the next 7 days: no phone in bedroom, Freedom/Cold Turkey schedule on all devices, CleanBrowsing DNS, two daily deep-work blocks, nightly wind-down routine, and one short speaking practice. Track it on paper. If you slip, reset immediately and shorten the gap to your next clean day. You can absolutely recondition this. Give it a month of consistency and your sleep and focus will start to come back."

        "percentile_10_comment": "I'd recommend using a pomodoro timer! 25 minutes on, 5 min break.",
        "comment_o3": "First, get rid of the “lazy” label—it’s usually just a mix of unclear goals, friction, and zero systems. Start by removing the most obvious friction: book an eye‑test and wear the right glasses or contacts every single day. When you can actually see the board you won’t have that built‑in excuse to drift off.\n\nIn class, keep doing what already worked: jot quick keywords, not full sentences, then Google or review them during a designated study block later. If writing everything feels heavy, set a tiny floor: commit to writing just one keyword per slide or five per lesson. Once you’re moving, momentum usually carries you.\n\nTo stay present, run mini Pomodoros during lectures: tell yourself, “I’ll lock in for the next ten minutes, then I’m allowed a 30‑second stretch or doodle.” Short, timed focus sprints give your brain something concrete to beat instead of a vague “pay attention all period.”\n\nPut obstacles in front of the easy distractions. Phone stays in your bag across the room; if you need it for research, keep it on airplane mode until break. Sit nearer to the front so daydreaming feels more obvious.\n\nWhen your mind inevitably wanders, don’t fight it—just note the thought in the margin, then bring your eyes back up. Treat it like mental push‑ups; every rep strengthens focus.\n\nAfter school, spend ten minutes rewriting or expanding the keywords into proper notes while the material is still fresh. Ten minutes is short enough that you’ll actually start; once you’re in motion you’ll probably go longer.\n\nStack a small reward to the end of that study block—playlist, snack, quick game—so your brain associates “did the work” with “good thing happens.”\n\nFinally, expect slip‑ups. Missing a session isn’t failure; skipping twice is. When you catch yourself coasting, reboot the very next class or day with the same tiny minimums.\n\nSee clearly, lower resistance, add structure, reward effort, and the “lazy” story will fade on its own. Good luck—you’ve already proved you can do the habit; now it’s just consistency.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Call it what it is: not “lazy,” just a system that makes drifting easier than focusing. Build a system that makes the next right action stupidly easy.\n\nFirst, fix the obvious friction. Short-sightedness isn’t a character flaw—get glasses/contacts if you can, sit in the front, and ask your teacher for slides or bigger printouts. Until that’s sorted, move closer and use thick, high-contrast pens and a clean notebook so your notes are readable.\n\nBring back your old “jot and Google” loop, but shrink it. Before class starts, open your notebook, write the date and topic. During class, aim for only three captures: a term, a question, a one-sentence summary. That’s it. If you catch yourself daydreaming, make a small dot in the margin as a reset cue, then write the last sentence you understood. Repeat as many times as needed without judgment.\n\nAfter class, do a 10-minute clean-up block. Google the terms you wrote, and make three flashcards (Anki or index cards). Stop after 10 minutes, even if you’re “in the zone.” Small, repeatable wins beat occasional marathons.\n\nMake drifting harder: phone on Do Not Disturb in your bag, sit away from talkative friends, feet flat on the floor, both elbows on the desk, pen in hand. Give your brain a job: “What’s the point of this section?” Write one answer each time the topic changes. Sleep enough, hydrate, and eat something before class—low energy feels like “lazy.”\n\nTrack it simply. Put a tiny checkbox at the top of each page and tick it when you hit your “3 captures + 10-minute review.” Aim for a 7-day streak. Reward yourself at 5 and 10.\n\nIf focus is still brutally hard across classes even after fixing vision and using these tactics, talk to a school counselor or teacher. There may be accommodations or attention-related issues worth checking out.\n\nDo the next class well, not the whole semester perfectly. Three captures in class, ten minutes after. That’s your floor.

        "comment_o3": "Start by treating “studying” as a daily appointment, not a heroic sprint. Pick a time you can reliably protect—30‑45 minutes is fine at first—and sit at the same place, with the same tools, every day. Consistency rewires your brain faster than marathon sessions do. While you’ve got a year, choose a free online course (Coursera, Khan, edX) that’s close to what you’ll face in school and move through it slowly. Watch a short lecture, close the video, and test yourself from memory before looking at your notes; active recall beats rereading for long‑term retention. When you want to keep facts, drop them into Anki or another spaced‑repetition app and run the deck for five minutes a day.  \n\nUse a simple Pomodoro timer—25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes of walking or stretching—to train attention stamina. If you complete two Pomodoros, log it in a notebook; the growing chain of checkmarks is its own motivator. Each Sunday, scan the log and decide what the next week’s target is: maybe one more Pomodoro, or tackling practice problems instead of just videos. Over time, you’ll slide up to two hours of honest focus without realizing it.  \n\nFinally, nail down the logistical stuff that trips returning students: a clutter‑free desk, cloud backups for notes, keyboard shortcuts, and a calendar that auto‑reminds you of deadlines. The technical friction you remove now is energy you’ll keep for harder material later. Millions of people go back to school in mid‑life and crush it; the ones who stick with a simple, repeatable routine end up feeling like they never left. Start small, show up daily, review weekly, and you’ll hit the first semester already warmed up.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Congrats on the decision. Treat the next year like a training plan for a marathon: build the habits and stamina now so school feels familiar, not shocking.\n\nStart with consistency over intensity. For the first 4–6 weeks, do two 25-minute study blocks a day at the same times, five days a week. Pick one subject you’ll likely need (math refreshers, writing, or a foundational course on Coursera/Khan Academy/edX). Use active recall instead of rereading: after a section or video, close everything and write what you remember, then check and correct. Make a few Anki flashcards from your own notes and review them daily. End each session by writing the next concrete action so tomorrow’s start is frictionless.\n\nBuild your environment and cues now. Same desk, minimal clutter, timer ready, phone in another room, website blocker on. Have a simple start ritual (tea, headphones, timer) to tell your brain “it’s study time.” Protect sleep and get two or three short workouts a week—those do more for focus than any app.\n\nAfter a month, scale up. Move to 90–120 minutes a day, five days a week, and add a weekly planning session on Sunday: list what you’ll study, block it on a calendar, and set small deadlines. Every week, do at least one timed, closed-book session to mimic quizzes. If your program is math-heavy, work through a Khan Academy path daily. If it’s writing-heavy, write 200–300 words a day summarizing an article and one short essay a week; get feedback via a friend, tutor, or online community.\n\nFocus on techniques that actually move the needle: Pomodoro 25/5, retrieval practice, spaced repetition (Anki), Cornell notes, and the Feynman technique (explain a concept in plain language). Minimize highlighting and passive reading. Keep a simple tracker for study minutes and streaks; momentum matters.\n\nAvoid burnout by planning recovery. Stick to five study days, one light day, one full rest day. Every 6–8 weeks, take a deload week where you cut volume by 30–50% but keep the routine. Keep a wins log to see progress.\n\nThree steps to start this week: pick one free course that matches your future program, set two daily 25-minute blocks at fixed times, and set up Anki with 10 self-made cards a day. Do a short weekly review on Sunday. Do this for a month, then adjust up. By the time classes start, you’ll already be “in season.”"

        "percentile_10_comment": "Why do you want to keep growing and get out of your comfort zone? This might seem like a strange question to ask, but different people will want this for different reasons. If you really want this then it can be extremely helpful to know why, exactly, you want it.",
        "comment_o3": "Complacency creeps in when the next step isn’t obvious or urgent, so the first move is to give your growth an address: pick one area you genuinely care about and define a clear, measurable target. “Read more” becomes “finish 12 non‑fiction books this year,” “get fitter” becomes “run 5 km in under 30 minutes.” Specificity creates friction against drifting.\n\nOnce the target is concrete, forget about motivation and build a process that makes the next action automatic. Decide when, where, and for how long you’ll work on it, put it on your calendar, and treat that block like an appointment you can’t miss. If you can’t see exactly when you’ll practice, you’ll default to someday—which is when complacency loves to visit.\n\nTo push your comfort zone without burning out, use the 85 % rule: most of the time stay in tasks you can do fairly well, but carve out 15 % of each session for something that’s just beyond your current ability. That sweet spot feels awkward enough to trigger growth but not so hard that you quit.\n\nTrack progress visibly—whiteboard, habit app, notebook, whatever you’ll actually look at. A streak counter or progress graph creates tiny hits of momentum and makes plateaus obvious before they turn into months of inertia. If the numbers stop moving, tighten the feedback loop: shorter cycles of plan‑do‑review, maybe weekly instead of monthly.\n\nAccountability multiplies discipline. Tell a friend, join a subreddit challenge thread, or hire a coach. The goal isn’t shame; it’s an external nudge that reminds you you’re playing a bigger game than “I’ll do it when I feel like it.”\n\nFinally, protect your identity as a learner. Each time you show up—even for five sloppy minutes—tell yourself, “I’m the kind of person who trains daily.” Identity‑based framing lasts longer than adrenaline spikes of motivation. Keep accumulating those tiny votes for the growth‑oriented version of you, and complacency loses its grip.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Complacency usually wins when goals are vague and days don’t have a clear “next action.” Give yourself a simple system that forces small wins and regular discomfort, then let the compounding happen.\n\nPick 2 areas to grow for the next 12 weeks. For each, choose one input you control, not an outcome. Example: career skill → ship one artifact per week (tiny blog post, GitHub commit, slide deck). Fitness → train 3 days/week for 30 minutes. Creativity → practice 20 minutes daily and publish once a week. Keep the floors tiny so you can’t talk yourself out of them.\n\nSchedule a daily “discomfort rep.” It should be a 6/10 on the discomfort scale—noticeably outside your comfort zone but not panic-inducing. Examples: DM one person for feedback, ask a question in a meeting, do the first cold shower minute, apply to one opportunity. Do it first or second thing in your work block. Your comfort zone expands through reps, not epiphanies.\n\nBeat procrastination with start rituals and environment. Decide the exact when/where for each input: “At 7:30 pm at my desk, I open VS Code and work 10 minutes on the project.” Use a 5–10 minute timer to start. Lay out gear the night before. Block the biggest distraction on your work device for your first 60–90 minutes. Default to single-tab, full-screen. Make the start frictionless and the distractions annoying to access.\n\nAdd stakes and accountability. Book a class, sign up for a low-stakes presentation in 4 weeks, schedule a check-in with a friend every Friday, or use a commitment contract. When something is on the calendar and someone expects it, complacency has to fight uphill.\n\nRun a weekly review. Every Sunday, update a simple scoreboard: how many inputs hit, what shipped, one thing to improve, one thing to drop. If you hit the floor easily for two weeks, raise it slightly. If you miss, don’t compensate with a huge catch-up—just re-establish your floor the very next day. Never miss twice is the rule.\n\nTemplate you can start this week:\n1) Choose two areas: say fitness and career skill.\n2) Floors: 30-minute workouts Mon/Wed/Fri. Ship one small artifact by Sunday.\n3) Daily discomfort rep at 9 am: send one outreach or ask one question.\n4) Work block ritual: 10-minute timer, one-tab rule, phone in another room.\n5) Sunday 20-minute review and plan the next week’s exact times.\n\nIf you keep the floors easy, the starts automatic, and the discomfort rep daily, you’ll stay out of stasis without burning out. Growth becomes the default because your calendar, environment, and tiny promises do the heavy lifting."

Maybe that is going to help you as well? :)",
        "comment_o3": "First, remember that every junior engineer I’ve met feels like they’re faking it. The folks who grow are the ones who turn that anxiety into a system. Start keeping a running “question log” in a plain text file: every time you hit a wall, write the question, spend 30‑60 minutes trying to answer it yourself, then take it to a teammate or Stack Overflow. Add the answer right under the question. In a month you’ll have your own mini‑wiki and you’ll notice how many things you can now answer solo.\n\nBlock one or two uninterrupted “deep work” hours on your calendar each day. Mute Slack, close email, set a timer for 25‑minute sprints (Pomodoro), and pick one bite‑sized task: reading a design doc, fixing a tiny bug, writing a unit test. Ship or document something tangible by the end of the block. Visible output calms impostor nerves and gives your team confidence in you.\n\nOutside those deep hours, be noisy in a good way: leave comments on PRs, ask clarifying questions in chat, volunteer for small chores. You’ll build a reputation for engagement long before you feel “expert.”\n\nAt home, treat life admin like code sprints: pick one condo task per weekend morning, set a two‑hour cap, and stop when the timer ends. Consistency beats marathon cleaning.\n\nBooks worth skimming: “Atomic Habits” for building tiny, repeatable routines; “Deep Work” for protecting focus; “The Making of a Manager” (even if you’re not a manager) for understanding how good work is scoped and delivered. Don’t binge‑read—apply one idea the same day you read it.\n\nIf therapy’s on pause, try a low‑stakes “mental health stand‑up” with a friend once a week: what went well, what was hard, what’s the next small step. It scratches the accountability itch until you find a new professional.\n\nFinally, keep the stripping fantasy in perspective: it shows you miss feeling competent and in control, not that you actually need to quit tech. Give yourself three months of the systems above before you judge your performance. You earned the offer; now build routines that prove it to yourself. You’ve got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "New job + new home + big life changes is a lot of context switching, so your brain is burning energy just keeping up. Don’t chase motivation; install tiny, boring systems and a clear ramp-up plan.\n\nAt work, ask your manager for what “good” looks like in the next 30 days and one small deliverable you can own end-to-end. Create a living doc with three sections: learning backlog (features, services, tools to study), today-I-learned notes, and open questions. When you get stuck, timebox 30–45 minutes to investigate, write what you tried and your hypothesis, then ask for help with that context. That turns “hand-holding” into good engineering practice. Aim to ship something small weekly—bugfix, test, docs—so you rack up visible wins. Do one deep-work block daily (start with 50 minutes, phone in another room, Slack snoozed) dedicated to the hardest task.\n\nRebuild focus like a muscle: use a 10-minute rule to start, then Pomodoro (25/5 or 50/10). End each day by writing the next action for tomorrow so you never start cold. Keep a “win log” of shipped items, PRs merged, questions answered—review it on Fridays to counter the “I’m not doing anything” feeling.\n\nKeep your home/life in maintenance mode for a bit. Do a 15-minute daily reset and one 60–90 minute weekly block for chores/admin. Say no to extra commitments for a month. Protect one true rest evening. You’re stabilizing, not optimizing.\n\nThe “I used to be able to study for hours” likely came from clear feedback loops and a sense of competence. Recreate that at work by tracing one request end-to-end in the codebase, documenting what you learn, and sharing it. Owning a narrow slice builds control fast.\n\nOn books: Atomic Habits (systems over motivation), Deep Work (how to actually focus), The First 90 Days (ramp-up framework), and A Philosophy of Software Design or The Pragmatic Programmer (clear thinking for engineers). Pick one habit book and one engineering book; don’t overload yourself.\n\nIf the therapist ghosted, check if your company has an EAP; they’ll fast-track counseling slots. In the meantime, try a daily 5-minute journal: What matters most today? What would make it a win? What did I learn? What will I do next?\n\nYou’re not behind—you’re early in the reps. Set a small target for tomorrow: one deep-work block, one documented question with context, one tiny ship. Stack those for two weeks and your confidence will follow the evidence."

      "body": "So I'm 18, no job, and I kinda fucked up my college life. I haven't done a single thing for the first semester of college and now my second semester is coming up in a few days, and now one of my scholarship funding sources are asking for my grades. WHAT DO I DO?!\n\nYou might be wondering how this happened...well...\n\nI have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \"content\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.\n\nAnother problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.\n\nEven when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\n\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say \"I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say \"just do it\", but it doesn't work like that.\n\nFor stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination. Could I get some strong advice for someone who has suffered through a strong addiction of some sort?\n\nEdit: Should I skip this second semester entirely to fix myself before I get back to college?

        "comment_o3": "First priority: stop the academic free‑fall. Go to your school’s advising or registrar office tomorrow, in person, and ask about a late withdrawal or leave of absence for last semester. Schools usually have a process that lets you wipe F’s off the transcript if you can document a medical/mental‑health issue; at worst they can tell you the deadline and your exact GPA situation so you know what you’re dealing with. While you’re there, ask what would happen to your scholarship if you sit out a semester—get facts before making the decision. That information will make the conversation with your dad and the scholarship provider a lot easier, because you can present a plan instead of just a confession: “I had a rough first semester, I’ve spoken with the school, I’m taking a leave/retaking the classes, here’s the timeline and what I’m doing to fix it.”\n\nSecond, treat the porn loop like any other compulsive behavior: remove frictionless access and add frictionless alternatives. Put your gaming PC/console in a common area or box it up and leave it at a friend’s for a month. Install blocking software that only a friend has the password to. Use your phone or a library computer for schoolwork so you can’t alter the blocker. When the urge hits, stand up, leave the room, and do ten push‑ups, walk outside, or open your textbook—teach your brain that the cue leads somewhere else. If you relapse, no moral drama; log it and reset the counter.\n\nThird, shrink your study sessions to something you cannot refuse. Literally set a timer for five minutes, open the syllabus, and start. When five minutes are up you can quit—most of the time you’ll keep going. Pair that with a hard daily cutoff: once it’s 6 p.m. you’re done for the day, no guilt, which prevents the “I wasted the morning so the day is ruined” spiral.\n\nFourth, get humans involved. Book an appointment with campus counseling (or a local therapist if you pause school). Tell one friend what you’re trying to fix and text them a photo of your study space each time you start a session—accountability doesn’t have to be deep, it just has to exist.\n\nTaking a semester off can work if you treat it like rehab, not vacation: structured schedule, part‑time job for routine, counseling, daily exercise, and clocked study blocks to retake or prep classes. Gather the facts from your school first, then decide. Whatever you choose, move on it this week—the sooner you act, the smaller the mess gets. Good luck; lots of people have dug out of deeper holes than this, and the common denominator is facing it early and systematically.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Short answer: you can’t undo last semester, but you can control how you handle it and how you set up the next 90 days.\n\nTriage first. Today, email your academic advisor and the financial aid office. Tell them you struggled first semester and ask about options: leave of absence for spring, academic probation, or a SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) appeal if your scholarship requires certain grades. Contact the scholarship provider proactively before they chase you. A simple script: “I had a rough first semester and didn’t meet expectations. I’m taking immediate steps with my advisor to get back on track and want to ask about deferring or appealing my scholarship for one semester while I put formal supports in place.” Proactive honesty beats silence every time.\n\nTalk to your dad the same way: own it, no excuses, present a plan, ask for specific help. Example: “I messed up the first semester. I’m meeting with my advisor and financial aid this week to either take a leave or go on probation with supports. I’m putting hard blocks on my devices and moving my studying to the library. I’d like your help holding the admin/passwords for a while.” People are far more receptive when you come with a plan.\n\nShould you skip second semester? If you don’t yet have the systems to work, a planned leave is smarter than repeating the same cycle and nuking your GPA and aid. But a leave must be structured: a part-time job with set hours, counseling, a daily routine, exercise, and a fixed study block to rebuild the “show up” muscle. If you do stay enrolled, treat it like rehab with training wheels: reduced course load, mandatory study blocks in public spaces, and accountability.\n\nOn the addiction/procrastination side, blockers you can turn off don’t work. You need friction you can’t bypass. Move your computer out of your bedroom or work only in the library. Remove your admin rights and have someone else hold the admin password. Set your router/phone DNS to a filtered service and have a parent hold the credentials. Consider a dumbphone or a locked-down Chromebook. Uninstall games and lock Steam/console with a PIN someone else controls. Keep your door open or work in public so it’s awkward to slip.\n\nYour “I get up and wander” is a conditioning issue, not a character flaw. You’ve trained your brain that your room+computer = entertainment. Change the context. Study at the library or a quiet café with a decent chair. Use a super-low friction start: sit down, open the doc, write one ugly sentence. Do 25 minutes on, 5 off. If you truly can’t focus, do “body doubling” (Focusmate, Discord study rooms, or a study buddy) so someone is virtually sitting with you.\n\nFor urges, run a 10-minute rule: when the urge hits, set a timer for 10, stand up, drink water, do 20 squats, step outside for 2 minutes of fresh air. Most urges crest and fall if you don’t feed them immediately. Track streaks if you like, but prioritize rebuilding your environment the same day after any slip. One slip isn’t a spiral unless you let it be.\n\nUse help that already exists. Most colleges offer free counseling—book it and specifically ask for support with compulsive sexual behavior and anxiety. If you take a leave, still do counseling and join a local or online support group. The point isn’t to talk forever; it’s to get external accountability and tools.\n\nConcrete next steps: send the two emails to advisor/aid today, text your dad to talk tonight and bring your plan, remove your admin rights and hand off the password, uninstall games and lock accounts, and go work at the library tomorrow at a set time for just 30 minutes. Win the next 48 hours. Momentum first, mastery later. You’ve dug a hole, yes—but the ladder is very buildable if you start with these boring but powerful moves."

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner. If you think you can skip this and get another extra 3 hours out of your day - you will be mistaken and this will be reflected in the next day's productivity which will be not as much as today, even if you sitting at the desk the work might not be in peak mental performance. TLDR: Take breaks, relax. But more importantly, PLAN the break time and the type of relaxation activity you will be indulging in.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "I’m pretty sure the quote they are referring to is the explanation given in the documentary ‘A Social Dilemma’. In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”\n\nLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/\n\nThere’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. \n\nAs always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!",
        "comment_o3": "What you’re running into is a mix of revenge‑bedtime procrastination and simple decision‑fatigue. Sixteen hours of heavy thinking drains the part of your brain that says “go to bed,” so the autopilot seeks an easy dopamine drip. Fight it with structure, not willpower. Pick a hard stop for work, then schedule a short decompress window you actually look forward to—maybe 30‑45 minutes of music, a walk, or light reading. When that window ends, the phone goes on a charger in another room, social apps are blocked by something like Cold Turkey, and the bedroom stays screen‑free. Make the shutdown ritual as automatic as brushing your teeth: shower, dim lights, stretch, fiction book, sleep. If you still need novelty during the day, insert micro‑breaks—five minutes outside, quick chat, cup of tea—so you’re not starved for stimulation by night. A tired brain can’t win a fight against infinite scroll, but it never has to if the phone is out of reach and the evening is pre‑decided.",
        "comment_gpt5": "What you’re describing is a mix of “revenge bedtime procrastination” and leftover arousal from a long, analytical day. After 16 hours of self-control, your brain craves easy novelty and autonomy. Add bright light and infinite scroll, and you’re basically hitting the gas on your nervous system right when you need to brake.\n\nTwo levers: a deliberate shutdown ritual and hard constraints on the phone. Pick a fixed “screens-off” time and set a bedtime alarm like you would for a meeting. At that alarm, do a 5–10 minute shutdown: jot tomorrow’s top 3, capture any loose ends, say “shutdown complete,” then put your phone to charge outside the bedroom. Use an alarm clock so you don’t “need” the phone. If you can’t resist, make it impossible: iOS Downtime/Android Bedtime with passcode held by a partner, Freedom/Opal/One Sec, or a cheap lockbox for the late hours. Turning off Wi‑Fi on a timer works surprisingly well too.\n\nGive your brain a clear off-ramp. Replace doomscrolling with low-stimulation decompression that still feels good: warm shower, light stretch, breathing for 3 minutes, tea, then paper fiction under dim warm light. The goal isn’t “productive leisure,” it’s “calm, repeatable cues that tell your body it’s safe to sleep.” Keep lights low and screens amber if you must use them; bright blue light will keep you wired. If you want a “treat,” bundle it with the routine, e.g., only read a favorite novel in bed after the phone is parked.\n\nMake the behavior change brain-dead simple. Pre-decide: “When it’s 10:30, I plug the phone in the kitchen, turn off Wi‑Fi, write tomorrow’s plan, shower, read, lights out.” If you lapse, don’t bargain; still get up at your usual time the next day to rebuild sleep pressure for the following night.\n\nAlso look upstream. Sixteen-hour days make binges more likely. If you can’t shorten the day, at least end “deep work” 60–90 minutes before bed so the shutdown routine isn’t fighting a running engine. Watch caffeine after midday, and consider deleting the most aggressive apps from your phone and allowing them only on desktop at limited windows.\n\nYou’ve already got solid ideas in your update. Pick one or two keystone changes (phone out of bedroom + shutdown ritual) and nail them for two weeks. Consistency beats intensity here, and once the cue–routine is automatic, the urge to scroll drops a lot."

        "percentile_10_comment": "I would get a job in construction. It's full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.\n\nYou can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.\n\nShe sounds toxic by telling you that you can't function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\n\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.",
        "comment_o3": "First, stop beating yourself up. Twenty‑six with a part‑time job and one class is not a life sentence; it’s just your current snapshot. What you need most right now is a clear one‑year plan that gets you to a livable income and a realistic exit date, while keeping school moving in the background instead of letting it run the show.\n\nIncome comes first because rent and groceries can’t be deferred. Treat “get to 35–40 hours a week” as Priority A. Apply daily, follow up every 48 hrs, and cast a wide net: retail, call centers, warehouse, temp agencies, hospitality, gig work—anything that starts paying quickly. Use Cleveland’s cost of living to your advantage; plenty of people your age share a house for $600–700 a month. If your current employer can’t give you hours, keep them only if the schedule flexibility helps school; otherwise swap them for a place that will.\n\nOnce you hit full‑time hours, track every dollar for a month. You’ll see where $100–200 leaks out that could become an emergency fund. Aim to save one month of projected rent before you move; that’s usually enough to keep surprises from sending you back home.\n\nKeep school but keep it cheap. Fill out FAFSA, talk to the community college’s financial‑aid office, and see whether you qualify for the Pell Grant—many students in your income range get tuition covered and some money back for books. Take only courses that march you toward a credential employers actually ask for (nursing prerequisites, IT cert classes, accounting, etc.). Evening or online sections let you hold a job without stretching yourself to the breaking point. One or two classes a term is fine; the degree doesn’t matter if you can’t pay the bills.\n\nAbout the $500 storage “rent”: that’s a drain. Offer your mom something concrete—spend two weekends photographing, listing, and selling the items, then split the money and shut the unit down. If she refuses, explain that you’ll have to redirect part of that $500 to your moving fund. You’re not dodging responsibility; you’re reallocating it so you can stand on your own.\n\nDaily discipline can be as simple as a three‑line checklist: job hunt tasks, school study block, exercise/house chores. Hit those three and the day is a win. Review progress every Sunday night, adjust, and repeat. Momentum compounds.\n\nIndependence before degree isn’t an either/or; it’s degree on low simmer while income and savings boil. Give yourself twelve months of focused effort, track the numbers, and you’ll be surprised how quickly the “incapable” label disappears. You’re not behind—you’re just at the starting line and finally facing the right direction. Now sprint.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not broken, you just need a clear, ruthless plan and a few habits you can stick to. Independence is mostly about steady income + predictable routines. A degree can help long-term, but the fastest lever right now is full-time work and taking over your own bills.\n\nMake income the priority for the next 90 days. Treat the job hunt like a job: set a daily block (e.g., 9–12) where you send tailored applications, follow up on ones you sent 48–72 hours ago, and call or walk in to places that are hiring. Aim for volume and speed over perfection. In Cleveland, look hard at hospital systems (Cleveland Clinic, UH, MetroHealth) for support roles like environmental services, dietary, patient transport, call center—these are often full-time with benefits and tuition help. Also check UPS/FedEx/USPS, warehouses, state/county/city job boards, security, grocery and retail chains, and temp agencies. Ask your current job to cross-train you for more hours while you search. Your goal is a full-time paycheck first; then you can be choosy.\n\nAbout school: unless this one class is a must-have prereq for a near-term higher-paying role or you have tuition help, it’s reasonable to pause next term until you lock a full-time job. Another path is to keep exactly one class but only if it doesn’t slow the job hunt. Once employed, use employer tuition benefits or a short cert that boosts pay fast (Tri-C has STNA/CNA, phlebotomy, medical billing, CDL, and entry IT like A+ or Google IT Support). Don’t let school be an indefinite delay—make it serve the independence goal.\n\nClean up the money. Write a bare-bones budget you’d live on if you moved out with roommates. Build a move-out fund with a first milestone of $1,000 cash buffer, then 2–3 months of basic expenses. Automate transfers the day you’re paid. The $500 you’re putting toward the storage space isn’t buying you independence—make it a project to shut that cost down. Set a 60-day deadline to liquidate: spend 60–90 minutes most days inventorying and listing items on Facebook Marketplace/OfferUp, batch buyers to weekends, donate or trash what doesn’t move, and close the unit. That one change could fund groceries, your phone plan, or savings.\n\nBuild a simple daily routine you can keep even when life is messy: fixed wake time, job search block, class/skill block, 30–45 minutes of housework and no more, a quick workout or walk, and a lights-out time. Do a weekly review every Sunday: how many applications, callbacks, interviews, dollars saved, and storage items listed/sold. Track it on paper; what gets measured gets done.\n\nStart taking over bills in stages. Move your phone to your name and buy your own groceries. It proves capability to both of you, and it forces the budgeting muscle to grow. As you take on bills, reduce what you hand your mom for nonessential expenses so you’re not spinning in place.\n\nHave a calm conversation with your mom with concrete milestones: “I’m applying to X jobs per week, plan to be full-time by [date], will take over phone and groceries by [date], storage unit closed by [date], target move-out by [date]—likely with roommates first.” Keep it about actions and dates, not arguments about capability.\n\nIt’s not stupid to work a “shitty” job if it’s a stepping stone. The win is stable income + reps living like an adult. Once that’s in place, stack skills or a degree on top with tuition help. Give yourself 12 weeks of militant consistency and you’ll feel like a different person, not because your worth changed, but because your days did. Focus on the next tangible action today: send five applications, follow up on two, list three items, cook one cheap meal, and be in bed on time. Repeat."

        "comment_o3": "Catching yourself slipping into that mental shortcut is already step 1, so build on that with a discipline framework: every time the thought pops up, label it—literally think “stereotype,” then follow it with a pre‑rehearsed counter like “one clip ≠ a whole group.” That pause + replace combo is the same habit loop athletes use to fix form: cue, routine, reward. Keep a quick tally in a notes app; the act of logging keeps you mindful and shows progress.\n\nFeed your brain better inputs. Unfollow rage‑bait accounts and add material that spotlights people from the groups you judge doing ordinary or admirable stuff. Algorithms serve what you engage with, so you can re‑train them in about two weeks of deliberate clicking.\n\nSchedule weekly reps of perspective‑building: read a chapter of something like “Blindspot” or “How to Be an Antiracist,” watch a documentary that centers voices you rarely hear, or attend a local cultural event. Treat it like gym time—put it on the calendar, set a reminder, track completion.\n\nFinally, get proximity. Volunteer, join a mixed sports league, or take a class where you’ll have genuine collaboration with people you’re biased against. Real‑life interactions shred stereotypes faster than any amount of scrolling.\n\nDo this consistently for a couple of months and the frequency and intensity of those thoughts will drop. It’s just mental conditioning: identify the bad rep, replace it with a correct rep, and keep showing up.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Respect for wanting to change. Treat this like any other habit: change inputs, install a pause, and practice a replacement thought until it’s automatic.\n\nFirst, fix the inputs. A lot of feeds are engineered to show you the most inflammatory clips. Unfollow rage-bait accounts, hit “not interested,” mute keywords, and set a daily time limit for short-form/video platforms. If you need a rule: no comments sections, no “recommended” tab. Curate your follow list toward long-form, nuance, and people who cover data/context.\n\nSecond, use an if-then plan to create a pause. “If I notice myself generalizing from a video to a whole group, then I will STOP: stop, take a breath, observe the thought, and proceed with a neutral rewrite.” Replace “they are X” with “this clip shows one situation; I don’t know the full context.” Ask: what’s a non-race explanation? Would I think the same if the people looked different? Remind yourself that viral content is selection bias; ordinary, good behavior doesn’t trend.\n\nThird, do two-minute thought records once a day. Write: trigger, automatic thought, evidence for, evidence against, balanced thought. Make it quick and consistent. To build the “counterexample” muscle, for every stereotype that pops up, list three counterexamples you’ve seen or know personally.\n\nFourth, add contact and counter-stereotypes to your routine. Follow creators from groups you’re biased against who post normal, everyday life. Join a mixed rec team, class, or volunteer shift where you work alongside people on shared goals. Proximity plus purpose rewires faster than arguments.\n\nFifth, anchor it to identity. Write a one-sentence value: “I’m the kind of person who treats people as individuals and aims to be accurate, not lazy.” Put it on your lock screen for a month.\n\nTrack progress like reps. Count “catches” per day. Goal 1: catch more often. Goal 2: shorten time from thought to rewrite. Goal 3: fewer unchallenged thoughts. Review weekly.\n\nIf you want structure, a CBT workbook or “Blindspot” by Banaji/Greenwald or “The Person You Mean to Be” by Dolly Chugh are practical. This won’t flip overnight, but with steady reps, the thought pattern loses its grip. Keep going."

      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

It shows you can stick with something hard and get results, which is exactly the muscle you need for everything else. Think of the next year as a “New Game+” run where you keep that willpower stat and start adding new skills.\n\nPick one life area to push forward for the next 30 days and ignore everything else that’s nagging you. Most people in your spot get overwhelmed because they try to rebuild career, finances, social life, hobbies, and mental health all at once. The fastest route is sequential, not simultaneous. Because money touches everything, I’d start there: download a budget app, log the last three months of spending, and give every dollar a job. Even if the numbers look ugly, seeing them in one place turns an invisible enemy into a visible one you can fight.\n\nLock in a daily rhythm that is dead simple, repeatable, and front‑loads the important stuff before your willpower leaks away. Wake up, drink water, make your bed, ten‑minute walk outside, five‑minute journal on paper, then the day can go any direction. Those tiny anchors keep your brain from spinning off first thing and build the “I keep promises to myself” identity. If you still game, park the console/PC in a closet or uninstall weekday access. Removing friction beats relying on willpower over and over.\n\nOn the career side, forget The One Perfect Passion. Pick any skill that pays reasonably well and has a clear learning path—coding bootcamp, HVAC apprenticeship, forklift cert, whatever sounds least awful—and treat it like grinding XP. Two focused hours of study or practice five days a week will outpace most people in six months. If analysis‑paralysis hits, flip a coin and commit; motion beats mental churn.\n\nYou mentioned alcohol and weed; those make depression worse and memory fuzzier. Try a 30‑day zero‑tolerance experiment. Tell yourself it’s data collection, not a life sentence. Track mood, energy, and sleep. Most people feel noticeably sharper by week three, which makes every other habit easier.\n\nSocially, aim for one real‑life interaction per week that isn’t family or coworkers: a pickup basketball game, volunteer shift, library class, whatever. Face‑to‑face time pulls you out of your head and reminds you the world is bigger than your thoughts. You do not need instant deep friendships; you just need reps.\n\nFinally, therapist or support group is a force multiplier. You’re untangling family baggage, addiction, and self‑talk—there’s no prize for soloing that dungeon.\n\nIf you stay consistent with a budget, a morning micro‑routine, a single marketable skill, and thirty days sober, you’ll be stunned how different life feels by your 30th birthday. Small, boring wins stacked daily beat the huge, flashy overhaul you keep waiting to start. You already proved you can do hard things; now make them the right hard things. Good luck, man—see you on the leaderboard.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not as far behind as you think. Plenty of people hit reset at 30 and build solid lives. You’ve already proven you can do hard things by dropping ~100 lbs. Let’s channel that into a simple, boring, repeatable system that doesn’t rely on motivation.\n\nStart with a minimum viable day. Pick a consistent sleep and wake time and protect it like a job. In the morning, hydrate, eat a real breakfast, get 10 minutes of sunlight and a brisk walk, and sit for 10 minutes of quiet breathing or a basic meditation app. Block one focused work session (25–50 minutes) on something that moves your life forward, then later in the day do 30–60 minutes of exercise and 15 minutes of cleaning or finances. Define “done for the day” as hitting those basics; if they’re done, you’re allowed to relax without guilt. This gives you structure and a clear finish line.\n\nOn gaming, alcohol, and weed: try a 90‑day reset. Uninstall games, stash the console/PC, and use site blockers on YouTube/scroll traps. For alcohol/weed, commit to a clean streak, tell one supportive person, and check in daily on communities like r/stopdrinking and r/leaves or try SMART Recovery/AA meetings. Fill the time vacuum on purpose: gym classes, a nightly walk, library time, or a hobby that uses your hands. If you reintroduce later, do it with rules (e.g., only scheduled social gaming 1x/week, no solo drinking, no weekday use). Also, fuel your body consistently. Extreme fasting plus alcohol will wreck energy and focus; aim for protein at each meal, plenty of water, and regular meals.\n\nFor focus, presence, and memory, externalize your brain. Keep a simple capture system: a pocket notebook or one notes app. Each evening, do a 10‑minute brain dump, then write Tomorrow’s Top 3 tasks. In the morning, read them before touching your phone. During the week, use a timer and do work in short, timed sprints with your phone in another room. Do a 30‑minute weekly review every Sunday: scan your notes, pick next week’s Top 3, and schedule them. If a perspective “clicks,” write it down in a “Rules for Future Me” note and reread it each morning for a week. That’s how you build recall—by revisiting the ideas.\n\nFor being present and a better listener, keep it mechanical. Before conversations, take one slow breath and feel your feet on the floor. While the other person talks, keep your eyes on their face and aim to paraphrase one sentence back (“So you’re saying…?”). Ask two follow‑up questions before you talk about yourself. When your mind wanders, notice it and return to their last sentence. It’s a rep, not a failure. Ten minutes of daily meditation will make this easier within a few weeks.\n\nOn career, don’t wait for passion. Action creates interest. Pick a “good‑enough” path you can start within weeks, not years, and test it with a 30‑ to 60‑day sprint. Examples that work for a lot of people: IT help desk via Google IT Support/CompTIA A+; trades like electrician/HVAC/plumbing apprenticeships; CDL; basic bookkeeping; entry customer success roles. Spend one hour a day on tangible outputs: finish a module, apply to two jobs, or book an informational call. Book one informational interview per week with someone in the role you’re exploring; ask how they broke in, what the day looks like, and what beginner mistakes to avoid.\n\nTighten finances with automation. List your fixed bills, set up auto‑pay on a separate “bills” account, and move a fixed “spending money” amount weekly to your main debit account. Track spending once a week for 15 minutes. Get any job that pays today if needed, then upgrade; income now beats “perfect later.”\n\nReplace online social time with real‑world reps. Join one recurring thing that meets weekly: a rec sports league, BJJ/boxing, Toastmasters, a community class, or volunteering. Put it on the calendar and show up even when you don’t feel like it. Real people and real stakes will retrain your brain away from virtual wins.\n\nBecause you mentioned depression and harsh self‑judgment, consider adding a pro to your team. Therapy, a primary care checkup, or a group like SMART/AA can accelerate everything. If money’s tight, look for sliding‑scale clinics or community mental health.\n\nHere’s a simple 90‑day challenge that covers all bases: consistent sleep and wake time; 10 minutes of meditation; one focused work block on career or job applications; one workout or long walk; 15 minutes of cleaning/finances; no gaming/alcohol/weed for 90 days; one in‑person social activity per week; weekly Sunday review to set your Top 3. Track it with a paper calendar and mark an X each day. Aim for “never miss twice.”\n\nYou don’t need to fix your whole life at once. You need one solid day, repeated. Stack those days and your brain, body, and opportunities will catch up fast. You’ve already proved you can change. Now make it boring and consistent. You’ve got this."

        "best_comment": "Here’s the thing - it’s totally normal. Procrastination is a reaction that’s stems from fear. So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here’s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

Tell yourself you only have to pick up one sock, or set a two‑minute timer and stop when it dings. Starting is the real hurdle; once you’re moving, momentum usually takes over.  \n\nPrep the environment so “doing something” is the default. Keep a trash bag open, leave the hamper in the middle of the floor, put the cleaning spray on the dresser—anything that removes the micro‑friction of hunting for tools.  \n\nGive your brain a small reward while you work. Play a podcast or playlist you only listen to when tidying; it turns the session into something you partly look forward to.  \n\nThe urge to do nothing never vanishes, but these tricks let you slip past it before it gets loud. Over time, the reps train your brain to see “just start” as the automatic response instead of “freeze.”",
        "comment_gpt5": "You probably won’t eliminate that pull completely. Brains hate open‑ended, mildly unpleasant chores. The trick is to make the “start” so tiny and automatic that your brain doesn’t get a vote.\n\nMake the first move pre-decided and microscopic. Example: at 7:00 pm, set a 5‑minute timer, put your phone on the charger in another room, and pick up just 10 items. That’s the whole plan. If you want to stop at 5 minutes, stop. The permission to stop kills dread; momentum usually takes care of the rest.\n\nUse the “do‑nothing rule.” Either clean or literally do nothing—no phone, no music, no sitting on the bed. If you want music or a podcast, you have to be cleaning. Boredom makes inaction costly and pushes you into motion.\n\nBundle a reward. Make a “cleaning playlist” or podcast you only get while tidying. Even a small carrot reliably reduces the friction to start.\n\nReduce friction in the environment. Keep a trash bag on the doorknob, a visible laundry hamper, and a “misc” basket to catch random items you’ll sort once a week. Lay these out in advance so starting tomorrow is one motion, not five.\n\nGive the task a clear edge. Define “done for today” as something like: make the bed, clear the floor path to the door, empty trash. Ambiguity breeds avoidance; specificity shrinks it.\n\nUse a state-switch ritual. Count down 5‑4‑3‑2‑1, stand up, hit the timer, and grab the first item. Same ritual, same time each day builds the groove.\n\nDo one 5‑minute sprint today. Tomorrow, repeat. You don’t need to like it or feel different—you just need a tiny start line and a system that kicks in before the wall‑stare does."

You got this!!",

        "comment_o3": "Absolutely you can change, and it starts with the next tiny decision you make. First, stretch that $1.25: a bag of dried beans, rice, or oatmeal from the discount aisle will keep you fuller than a candy bar or soda. If there’s a food pantry, church, or community fridge nearby, swallow the pride and grab what you need; you can pay it forward later.\n\nTonight, grab paper and list two things: every cent you have or expect to get this week, and every unavoidable expense. Seeing it in black‑and‑white kills the fog. Now circle the single biggest lever you control—usually income. Tomorrow your “discipline rep” is applying to one gig, day labor site, or side hustle, even if it feels beneath you. Repeat that rep every day. Momentum is more important than the size of any one win.\n\nAdd one habit that costs nothing and builds self‑trust—push‑ups, a ten‑minute walk, reading one chapter at the library—whatever you’ll actually do. Check it off each day. When life feels chaotic, that small daily promise keeps your head above water and builds the muscle you’ll use to handle bigger goals.\n\nPlenty of people have rebooted their finances and lives well past 37. The pattern is the same: survive the day cheaply, track the numbers, make one move to raise income, and stack a tiny self‑respect habit. Do that for a month and you won’t recognize yourself in a year. You got this.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Yes, you can change it, and 37 is not late. Start with the next 24 hours and build momentum from there.\n\nFirst, handle today’s food. Call 211 and ask for the nearest food pantry or free meal site; many allow same‑day walk-ins and churches often have emergency food bags. Use a library computer to search “food pantry near me” or “soup kitchen near me” and check hours. Apply for SNAP right away; if you have little or no income you may qualify for expedited benefits in about a week. Libraries and local “American Job Center”/Workforce centers can help with applications and sometimes bus passes.\n\nGet a quick cash bridge if you can. Walk into a day‑labor place like PeopleReady/Labor Finders/your local day labor center early in the morning; a lot of those pay the same day. Ask about any gear you need—some provide it. Also check community boards and Facebook/Nextdoor for same‑day odd jobs like yard work, moving help, or cleaning.\n\nNow set a simple, non‑negotiable daily routine. Pick a wake time and stick to it. Do a 10‑minute cleanup, a 30‑minute walk, and one focused block for survival tasks: either apply to five jobs, make three calls for resources, or show up somewhere work is handed out. Write these on paper and check them off. Keep a “don’t miss twice” rule—if you slip one day, get right back on it the next. Track every dollar in a notebook; for the next 30 days, cut anything that isn’t food, transport to work, or basic hygiene. If you drink or use, pause it for a month and let that energy go into getting stable.\n\nThink in sprints: today = food and one action toward income; this week = secure benefits, land short‑term work, keep your daily routine streak; this month = steady income, a bare‑bones budget, and a cleaner space. Small wins compound fast when you keep promises to yourself.\n\nYou’re already doing the most important thing by deciding to try. Handle today, then stack another day like it. Come back with updates—people will help you refine the plan."

        "percentile_10_comment": "I feel like getting to the heart of your sleep problems will help a lot with almost everything else on this list? Like if you can, find some way to access a sleep specialist, spend some money on it if you can, really try to get a decent sleep schedule. Try everything you can, this matters a lot. \n\nSleep is so so so important for physical and mental health. It won't magically fix everything, but I feel like it's a good first step.",
        "comment_o3": "Quick wins first, then bigger moves.\n\nStart with sleep. Everything you wrote (energy, focus, weight, mood) gets worse when you’re chronically underslept. Pick a single, non‑negotiable wake‑up time that gives you 7–8 hours if you were asleep by 2 a.m. Even if you lie awake, get up at that set time; the mild pain trains your body to fall asleep earlier within a week or two. Kill screens and bright lights 60 min before bed, caffeine after noon, and alcohol on study nights. If you snore, wake up gasping, or feel dead tired no matter what, ask a doctor about sleep apnea—tons of “overweight, always tired, ADHD that meds don’t fix” folks discover that’s the real culprit.\n\nNext, create a 30‑minute morning “launch sequence.” Water, quick stretch, meds, review today’s three priorities, 10‑minute apartment tidy. That little clean‑up stops the shame spiral and gives you a daily victory before work.\n\nFor ADHD productivity, treat tasks like reps at the gym: short, counted, and timed. Use a 25/5 Pomodoro timer and aim for just two of those before lunch. Put your phone in another room, open only what you need, and start with something that takes five minutes to finish so your brain gets the dopamine hit. Momentum matters more than ambition right now.\n\nThe law degree feels huge because it’s undefined. Break the remaining six months into weekly deliverables (e.g., “Read and outline Chapter 3 cases by Friday”). Track them on a wall calendar you can physically mark. When you hit four weeks of green X’s, reward yourself with something guilt‑free.\n\nAbout work: spend the first 15 minutes of every day writing the ONE thing that will get you fired if you ignore it. Do that first. Email your boss a short “Here’s what I’m on today” note; light accountability works wonders, and they’ll likely appreciate the visibility.\n\nFinances: open a spreadsheet tonight, list every debt, minimum payment, and interest rate—ugly truth on one page. Tomorrow call each collector and set up an autopay plan. Once a payment schedule exists, the mental noise drops dramatically.\n\nThe apartment: set a timer for 10 minutes after work and fill one trash bag. Stop when the timer rings. Repeat daily. Small doses bypass the overwhelm and, inside a month, the place will look completely different.\n\nFinally, don’t try to “feel motivated.” Act first, mood follows. Keep the commitments tiny, track them visibly, and stack small wins. Six months of steady, boring reps will rescue the degree, calm the job situation, clear the room, and shrink the debt. You’ll still be you—just a version that finishes things. Good luck, man.",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re closer to a turnaround than it feels. Think triage, not total overhaul. Pick a few levers that create outsized results and run them for 6–12 weeks.\n\nFirst, make a call on the law degree. Either finish intentionally or quit intentionally—no more limbo. If finishing aligns with your goals, lower the bar to “minimum viable pass.” Break the 6 months into weekly targets and schedule two short study sprints on weekdays and one on Saturday. Use body-doubling (Focusmate, library study rooms, “study with me” streams). Your only rule: open the materials and work for 10 minutes. Activation beats motivation. If you still hate it after 10, you can stop. Most days you’ll keep going.\n\nFix sleep like it’s a job. Pick a consistent wake time and protect it for 30 days, even after bad nights. Get outside within 15 minutes of waking for 10–15 minutes of daylight, move your body a bit, cut caffeine after noon, set a wind-down alarm 60–90 minutes before bed, and keep your phone out of the bedroom. Given the lifelong fatigue, delayed sleep, and unrefreshing mornings, talk to your doctor about a sleep study and basic labs (thyroid, iron, B12, vitamin D, etc.). If your sleep is circadian-delayed, ask about timing strategies/treatments. Medication helps ADHD more when sleep is handled.\n\nAt work, build tiny daily structure and external accountability. Each morning, write your top one task that actually moves the needle and do a 25-minute sprint on it before anything reactive. Break deliverables into steps you can finish in 30–60 minutes and time-box them on your calendar. Send your manager a short status note or post in the team chat: here’s what I’m doing today, here’s what’s next, here’s any blocker. It lowers anxiety and keeps you ahead of deadlines.\n\nFor energy and weight, don’t try to out-discipline biology. Keep it simple: add two 10-minute walks a day (after meals is great) and prioritize protein at the first meal. If weight won’t budge despite “eating healthy,” collect data for two weeks with a food log and a kitchen scale—not forever, just to calibrate. Track weight trend (not single days). Sleep and walking often move the needle more than heroic gym plans at first.\n\nTame the apartment with a daily 10-minute reset. Set a timer after dinner, put trash in a bag, dishes in the sink/dishwasher, clothes in a hamper, and clear one surface. That’s it. Pick one “always clean” zone (desk or kitchen counter) and protect it daily. Keep supplies where you use them, and use body-doubling for a weekly 30–60 minute deeper clean. Momentum here spills into everything else.\n\nFor finances, stop the bleeding and make it boring. Gather balances, minimums, and due dates. Set up autopay for minimums so nothing slips. Call collectors and get on a payment plan—one uncomfortable hour now saves months of stress. Use a simple zero-based budget (YNAB, Monarch, or a spreadsheet) and schedule a recurring 30-minute “Money Monday” to pay bills, reconcile, and plan the next week. Freeze discretionary cards if you need to.\n\nSocial stuff: go in with a tiny script. Before meetings, write one point you’ll make and one question you’ll ask. Say something in the first five minutes to break the ice in your brain. After each meeting, jot a one-line debrief. Reps matter more than confidence.\n\nMake the system visible so you don’t rely on memory. Night before: lay out clothes, put your study materials on the desk, and write tomorrow’s top work task on a sticky note. Morning: light, walk, one 25-minute study sprint, shower, then work top task. Afternoon: walk. Evening: 10-minute tidy. Once a week: Money Monday and a 30-minute weekly review to map your top three outcomes for work and uni and time-box them on your calendar.\n\nTwo meta-tips. Make quitting a decision, not a drift: if you’re going to stop something, pick a date, review, then choose. And use supports that fit ADHD: body-doubling, timers, blockers (Cold Turkey/Focus), and accommodations at uni/work if available. ADHD coaching or skills-based CBT can also be a force multiplier.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person—just stack a few small, repeatable behaviors and let them compound. Give this a clean 6–12 week run and reassess. Motivation will lag; action first, feelings follow."

        "comment_o3": "Make tomorrow’s plan tonight. Before you go to sleep, grab a piece of paper and block out the next day in hour‑long chunks: wake‑up time, workout time, breakfast, chores, free time, etc. Leave some blank space but give each block a label, even if it’s just “read for 30 minutes” or “walk around the neighborhood.” When you wake up, you won’t need to decide what to do—you’ll just look at the list and start.  \n\nIf you want new hobbies, treat them like experiments. Pick one that sounds interesting—guitar, coding with freeCodeCamp, sketching with a cheap pencil set, running a Couch‑to‑5K plan, whatever—and stick it in one of those blocks every day for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks decide: keep, modify, or drop it and test something else. Two weeks is long enough to see if it clicks but short enough that you won’t feel trapped.  \n\nScrolling happens because it’s the easiest option, so make it slightly harder. Charge your phone outside your bedroom, use a site blocker on YouTube after a set amount of time, or set a kitchen timer for 20 minutes whenever you open the app. When the timer goes off, switch to your schedule.  \n\nYou’ve already got a workout habit, which is great—treat everything else the same way: small, scheduled, repeatable.

        "comment_gpt5": "Totally normal to drift when summer removes structure. The fix isn’t “more motivation,” it’s a simple plan for what happens right after you stand up.\n\nTonight, pick a wake time and write a tiny morning script you’ll follow on autopilot: alarm goes off → phone across the room → drink water → 10 pushups → 5–10 minute walk outside → shower → 20 minutes on a skill before you touch YouTube. That “when X, then Y” removes decision-making and gives your day a clear start.\n\nPick one skill project for the summer and give it 20–60 minutes right after the shower. Since you like music, options could be learning an instrument or basic music production, but you can also try beginner coding (free Python courses), drawing (follow a 30-day fundamentals playlist), a language (Duolingo + one grammar video), cooking (one new recipe per week), or something tactile like solving a Rubik’s cube or juggling. Set concrete mini-goals: learn 3 chords and play one song, finish the first 5 modules of a course, draw 30 heads in 30 days, cook 10 meals. Track progress on a paper calendar and don’t break the chain.\n\nKeep your workout and chores as anchors later in the day. I like the Rule of 3: pick three wins for the day—skill session, workout, one “adulting” task (deep-clean a drawer, mow the lawn, organize your desk). Everything else is bonus. Use a 25-minute timer if starting feels hard; promise yourself you can quit after one block.\n\nTame the scroll by changing the environment, not your willpower. Move YouTube to the evening only, remove Shorts/TikTok, set a 30–45 minute app limit, and use the subscriptions tab instead of the home feed. If you can, keep the phone in another room until after your morning skill block.\n\nMake a quick “boredom menu” you can see on your wall: 15 minutes reading, 15 minutes music practice, 15 minutes sketching, learn one magic trick, language review, stretch/mobility, bike ride, photo walk, or a single household task. When you feel the urge to scroll, pick one item and do just 10–15 minutes.\n\nIf you want more structure/social stuff, look for a part-time job, volunteer at the library/community center, join a pickup sports game, or a local class/workshop. Even a few hours a week will make the rest of your time feel more valuable.\n\nStart tomorrow: write your morning script, pick one skill, set a 20-minute timer after your shower, and push YouTube to the evening. Do that for 7 days. You’ll feel the difference fast, and then you can tweak."

It's cost me every job and hobby I've ever had and it's cost me the love of my life. \n\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day.

I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on — as you seem to well know. \n\nI set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \n\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I’m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\n\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I’d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don’t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I’d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn’t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn’t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \n\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly. Accomplishing these small goals will build confidence, which inspires motivation, which is how you build discipline. That’s how I overcame the problem you’re having.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won't last. If hope is your motivator, it will. \n\nA big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks. If you get distracted, notice the task again and feel overwhelming shame it's hugely painful, so you avoid that feeling, therefore avoiding the task. Working through that shame, so that your able to notice the thing you forgot and just go \"oh, I did want to finish that\", that's the game changer. \n\nIt needs to be ok that you stopped the task. (Which, spoiler, it is)\n\nSocietal ways of dealing with someone (both yourself and others) forgetful or easily distracted tend to involve making the person \"care\" enough about it, which means feel so bad about it you'll never do it again. You ever had that lector from yourself or others? This doesn't work in the long run and takes a LOT of dedication and time to overcome. \n\nIt's not that you don't care, it's that you're wired to be distracted and forgetful. Just have to restart a few times, and that's ok.",
        "comment_o3": "I’ve dealt with something similar and a few things finally moved the needle for me. First, stop framing it as “I need more discipline.” The word is loaded in your head, so swap it for “experiments.” Pick a ridiculously small, 5‑minute experiment you can do every day for two weeks. For a game dev that might be opening the project and fixing one line or writing one sentence of a design doc, then you’re allowed to quit. For music it could be playing one scale on a single string. It feels stupidly small, but that’s the point: you’re proving to your brain that showing up doesn’t equal pain.\n\nSecond, separate outcome from identity. Instead of “I never finish games so I’m undisciplined,” try “I haven’t found a system that lets me finish yet.” Keep a physical notebook and each day write the date and what your 5‑minute experiment was. That growing list is concrete evidence that you can follow through, even if the tasks are tiny.\n\nThird, outsource structure until it’s boring. Join a coworking Discord with daily check‑ins, hire a cheap accountability coach on Focusmate, or book a practice session with a teacher who expects a scale every lesson. External eyes lower the bar to starting because someone else is holding the frame.\n\nFourth, treat therapy like a skills coach, not a deep dive into childhood unless you want that. A CBT or schema therapist can help you neutralize the “discipline = threat” association with evidence‑gathering and exposure exercises, the same way people unlearn phobias.\n\nFinally, give yourself a single finish line this year: one tiny, shippable game jam entry, one recorded cover that uses sheet music, whatever. Everything you do funnels toward that one finish, no side quests. When the urge to abandon pops up, remind yourself the whole goal is simply to finish something small once, not to make it perfect.\n\nIt’s unglamorous, but stacking laughably easy reps, using outside scaffolding, and aiming for one concrete finish is how I turned the lifelong wall into a speed bump. You can, too. Good luck.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Yes, people do get past this. Not by muscling more willpower, but by redesigning the work so it doesn’t trigger the “discipline = threat” reflex.\n\nRename “discipline” to “defaults.” Build two daily defaults: a tiny start and a tiny finish. The start is a 3-minute ritual that never changes: sit down, open the tool, set a 3-minute timer. The finish is an objectively done outcome you can produce in minutes. For games: one mechanic toy, one level, hit build, upload a GIF or prototype somewhere. For music: record a 20–30s clip of one scale/arpeggio or a clean passage once. You are allowed to stop immediately after the finish. The win is “I started and I finished,” not “I worked hard.”\n\nTime-box everything. When the wall shows up, shrink the box. Three minutes → one minute → one line of code or one scale once. If you still can’t start, change location/posture, restart the 3-minute timer, and aim for the tiniest finish. Treat the wall as a cue to make the task dumber and smaller, not a verdict on you.\n\nScope ruthlessly so you ship. For the next two weeks, make toys and prototypes only: one mechanic, one level, no menu, no polish, daily upload. For music, tether technique to fun: between songs, do a single scale once, then back to the song. That’s exposure without rebellion.\n\nExternalize discipline so it’s not you vs you. Body doubling (Focusmate, Discord coworking, friend on call), daily check-ins with one person, weekly game jam or open mic. Short deadlines + witnesses beat internal pep talks.\n\nTrack the bare minimum: a notebook with two checkboxes per day—start done? finish shipped? yes/no. Count streaks even if the session was three minutes. If you miss, don’t do guilt math—just reset and do the next tiny start.\n\nIf ADHD is part of this, lean on scaffolding: meds if accessible, timers everywhere, clean workspace, fidget, background noise, consistent sleep/caffeine cutoff. These aren’t “being disciplined,” they’re crutches that make starts frictionless.\n\nGive this 14 days. Expect the urge to bail. Don’t negotiate with it—shrink the task, do the rep, leave. You’ll stack completions, rebuild trust with yourself, and your brain will learn that “discipline” can be small, safe, and finishable. Over time, you can increase the minutes, but only after the daily start/finish feels automatic."

        "percentile_10_comment": " A someone who struggled with dissorderd eating, imposing more restrictions when you are already (physically OR mentally) restricting WONT help your cause. For me, i was treating some other internal issues with food (anxiety, boredom etc.) I started to restrict even more and made it 7 times worse.\n\nWhen you label food as something forbidden, it will be the only thing you can think about. The more you restrict it, the more you want it. It works for only a miniscule percentage of people.\n\nWhat helped me and what i think you should do is throw away all restrictions, quit tracking calories, ditch the scale and let your body eat what it craves. Keep in mind you might eat  very \"unhealthy\" and big amounts of food in the beggining, but your body wont crave it forever and it will begin to crave different food groups.\n\nDuring that process practice mindfulness and mindful eating. I highly suggest you look into intuitive eating. You cannot \"fail\" intuitive eating, you can only learn from it. \n\nBtw. 2000 kcal is a NORMAL amount of food and its nothing to be ashamed of. If your goal is weight loss, i suggest you first deal with your food issues, and after you have healed that relationship, you can work on the quality of your diet, which will probably result in slow but healthy and happy weight loss.\n\nI know this seems like a very slow proces, but its a lot faster than years of cycling between restricting and overeating.\n\nF the bikini body, your happiness is more important. Treat the issue (could be anything, you gotta figure it out on your own), not the symptom (overeating).",
        "comment_o3": "A few things that helped me shrink my intake without feeling miserable. First, make the decision at the grocery store, not in the kitchen. If the only snacks in the house are things you don’t mind eating in bigger quantities—baby carrots, pickles, air‑popped popcorn—it’s hard to blow up your calories no matter how bored you feel. Leftovers are trickier, but you can pre‑portion them into single‑serve containers and freeze anything beyond tomorrow’s meals. The extra step of thawing adds just enough friction to let the craving pass.\n\nSecond, schedule your eating the same way you’d schedule workouts. Pick a simple rule like “I eat at 10, 2 and 7” or an 8‑hour eating window. Outside those times, the kitchen is closed. If you’re genuinely hungry, drink a full glass of water, wait fifteen minutes, then reassess; half the time the urge disappears because it was thirst or boredom masquerading as hunger.\n\nThird, give your brain an automatic alternative for boredom. Make a two‑minute move rule: whenever you catch yourself wandering toward the fridge, you have to do something active for two minutes first—push‑ups, a walk around the block, tidying a drawer. After the two minutes you can still eat if you want, but the pause breaks the habit loop and often fulfills the need for stimulation that was driving you there in the first place.\n\nFinally, track what you do, not just what you hope to do. Log everything in an app like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal, even the handful of chips. Seeing the numbers stack up in real time builds awareness and makes the gap between 2500 and 1700 obvious and actionable. If you miss your target, don’t spiral; look at the log, find the 300‑calorie item that pushed you over, and plan one concrete change for tomorrow. String a few of those days together and the new intake level becomes the default rather than a constant fight.",
        "comment_gpt5": "Boredom eating is a habit loop, so make the loop harder to start and easier to replace.\n\nFirst, fix the environment. Pack leftovers into single portions immediately after cooking, label them “tomorrow’s lunch,” and stick most in the freezer. Put tempting stuff out of sight (foil or opaque containers), healthy stuff front-and-center. No eating from the pot or the package, and use a plate at a table with no screens.\n\nSet a default “craving script.” Example: if you want to eat outside your planned meal/snack, do 3 things first—big glass of water, mint tea or gum, and set a 20‑minute timer. Urges peak and fade. If you still want something after the timer, have a pre-decided 150–200 kcal snack (Greek yogurt, apple + peanut butter, carrots + hummus, air‑popped popcorn) and stop there.\n\nPre‑plan your day. Log meals the night before or morning of. Include a small daily treat so you don’t feel deprived. Aim for a weekly average—don’t jump from 2500 to 1500 overnight. Try 2200 for a week, then 2000, then 1800, then 1700. A “kitchen closed” time after dinner helps.\n\nPrioritize satiety. Get protein and fiber at every meal (eggs/Greek yogurt/chicken/beans + a big pile of veggies). Volume foods are your friend: soups, salads, stir‑fries, popcorn, berries. Most people find this makes 1500–1700 way easier.\n\nReplace boredom with a tiny action list. When the “I’m bored” itch hits, pick one 5‑minute thing: walk outside, tidy one surface, 20 squats, shower, read 5 pages, learn 10 vocab words. Tell yourself you only need to do 5 minutes; often that’s enough to kill the urge.\n\nTwo bonus rules that help a ton:\n- No second helpings until 10 minutes have passed.\n- No calories while standing—sit, plate it, track it.\n\nTrack wins. Put a sticky note on the fridge and tally every time you run the craving script instead of snacking. Aim for progress, not perfection. A few days of this and the urges lose their bite. You’ve got this."
