      "body": "I really feel like a complete failure. I Can’t handle it. I was diagnosed with adhd and binge eating disorder. I take vyvanse 5 days a week. My issue is, even when I do take my vyvanse I’m not as productive as I’d like to be. I take two days off so the vyvanse can keep working. On those days off, I eat so much. I’m just so disappointed in my self. It’s hard to drink water. I’m lethargic on my days off. I only work out on the days I take vyvanse. I’m trying to learn to trade but I need to be more focused and put my time into it. My diet is shit. I’m tired. I need to know how to do things at least decent without my medication and I need to utilize my time and be more productive when I do take my medication. Food makes me feel like shit. I’m just mad at life. I’m not depressed I’m just disappointed. \n\nI’m a ball full of energy. I’m an attractive lady. I am in college part time I have a job I have a car I have a plan. I am not dirty. But I am unorganized. I am reasonable and realistic and I think about my future a lot and my future responsibilities towards my future family. I take care of my body , skin, shower, teeth, but I suck at eating well and I suck at drinking water so my body feels like shit. But I’m just doing so bad. My binge eating ruins me. I’m a caffeine addict. I don’t know how I will function without my meds when I’m pregnant without wanting to kill myself from all the binge eating and laziness I will become and I will hate my body. I am 22 years old haven’t even gotten my associates degree yet.\n\nHow do I just reset my stupid brain? From food And phone and simple easy dopamine pleasures like sugar and food and my phone. How do I have energy? How do I get motivated ? How do I stay focused and not side tracked? How do I reset my brain to be able to handle boringness and discipline? Discipline is doing what u don’t wanna do. I’m not disciplined. \n\nHow do I rewire my brain to be able to handle discipline? And how do I stay focused and get back on track if I fall off? I feel hopeless but I care so much. I don’t feel good . I would feel so guilty being a horrible wife and mother who can’t take take of her family and her self. Like I just want to be able to have ups and downs but consistently be disciplined in all areas of life and just deal with the pain and boringness of it until I get used to being disciplined. HOW do I do this? I’m\nTired of going in circles :/ I have so much wrong with me but I wanna fix it",

Genuine question, as a reliant Vyvanse taker myself.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a diabetic to just learn to live without insulin, or a paraplegic to suddenly get up out of their wheelchair and start walking.  So what's wrong with taking Vyvanse to correct the chemical imbalances in your brain?\n\nThat's how my psychiatrist justified it to me at least though, lol",

        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out and looking to make positive changes. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few steps that might help you build discipline and manage your habits better:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Focus on one habit at a time. For example, try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. Once that becomes routine, add another small habit like a 5-minute walk or a short meditation session.\n\n2. **Plan Your Days Off**: Since you feel lethargic on your Vyvanse-free days, plan low-energy activities that still keep you engaged. This could be reading, light stretching, or organizing a small area of your room.\n\n3. **Mindful Eating**: Try to be more conscious of your eating habits. Keep a food journal to track what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you identify patterns and make healthier choices.\n\n4. **Limit Phone Time**: Set specific times for phone use and stick to them. You can use apps that limit screen time to help you stay on track.\n\n5. **Exercise Regularly**: Even on days you don't feel like it, try to do some form of physical activity. It doesn't have to be intense; even a short walk can boost your mood and energy levels.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This will help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to change.\n\nRemember, discipline is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not broken; you’re running into very predictable ADHD + stimulant rebound + BED patterns. Willpower isn’t the fix—simple systems are.\n\nFirst, talk to your prescriber about the two-day med breaks. Many people binge and crash on “off” days. You may do better with a different dose, schedule, or an adjunct (and BED-specific therapy like CBT‑E). Don’t white‑knuckle this alone when there are tools made for it.\n\nBuild two modes for your week. Vyvanse days = deep work and training focus. Off days = recovery and maintenance (errands, laundry, meal prep, walks, light workouts). Plan each the night before so you wake up already knowing “today is a Mode A or Mode B day.”\n\nCreate a tiny daily floor you hit every single day, no matter what. Three anchors: water, protein, movement. As soon as you wake, finish 16–24 oz water (set it on your nightstand before bed). Eat protein in the first hour (eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake). Move for 10 minutes outside. If the day goes sideways, you still did your floor.\n\nStructure food to prevent binges: three meals plus 1–2 snacks, never go >4 hours. Each eating time gets protein + fiber + carbs. Don’t “save calories”; that primes binges. Pre‑plan the next day’s simple menu in 2 minutes at night. Keep tempting binge foods out of the house for now or buy single‑serves only. Use an “urge delay”: when the craving hits, set a 10‑minute timer, drink a glass of water, brush teeth, take a short walk. If you still want it after, portion it into a bowl and sit at the table. Repeatable beats perfect.\n\nReduce phone pull with friction. Charge it outside the bedroom. First hour of the day is phone‑free. Put it in another room during meals and focus blocks. Grayscale + app limits + a blank home screen help more than “trying harder.”\n\nOn Vyvanse days, do 2–3 focus blocks of 25/5 or 50/10. Before each block, write the one next action in a verb form (“Open notes, outline Section 1”). Body‑double if you can (friend, library, Focusmate). End your work by writing tomorrow’s first three actions so you restart fast.\n\nOn off days, still move: a walk, light lift, yoga, or a 15‑minute “movement snack” every few hours. Use those days for batch cooking, groceries, and tidying so med days can be for deep work.\n\nCap caffeine (e.g., 200–300 mg before noon) and taper 25% per week if needed. Lock sleep: same wake time daily, morning light, screens off 60 minutes before bed. These two alone will boost energy and appetite regulation.\n\nWhen you slip, reset in the next hour, not next Monday. Go straight to the floor: water + protein + 10‑minute walk. No punishment, no “make up for it.” Just resume.\n\nIf you want two quick resources: Overcoming Binge Eating (Fairburn) for BED skills and Your Brain’s Not Broken (Nagoski/Saline) for ADHD strategies. Give this a 7‑day experiment and iterate. Small floors, clear modes, repeatable rules—that’s discipline you can live with."

      "body": "I don't really have any friends. I have nojob. The only thing going for me is that I'm not ugliest guy in the world and im in ok shape physically. My parents are also old but still alive and we talk occasionally which im grateful for in a lot of ways but feel like once they are gone I'll have absolutely no support system.  I have a bit of savings as well which is helping me get by but life feels confusing and difficult at times. I also feel old because I'm 31 and I don't have any parts of my life figured out at all. I lost all my relationships in 20s because I was depressed from making stupid decisions snd feeling confused about life. I was also ghosted by a girl recently who was pretty attractive but didn't want to put up with my shit apparently. I think she only wanted sex anyways which is a strange thing to say and im kind of over that part of my life... or she just thought i was a loser. She wouldn't really say other than she didn't want anything serious and I was too serious...\n\nI wish felt like I was making a difference in people's lives even though I feel lost. Fitness is what I do currently but outside of that I don't very many other positive habits or routines . At times I feel like I'm crazy cause I can be somewhat miserable on more than one occasion and can't interact very well with other people. People are fed up for good reason. I dont have a life",

A 10 or 100 small steps in the right direction  will still be 10 or 100 steps better then where you were before.\n\nHaving said that, make a list of things or goals in major areas of your life physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually.

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but the fact that you're in decent shape and have some savings is a solid foundation to build on. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with something manageable. It could be as simple as waking up at the same time every day or dedicating 30 minutes to reading or learning something new. Small wins can build momentum.\n\n2. **Explore New Interests**: Since fitness is already a part of your life, maybe look into related fields like nutrition or personal training. This could open up new career opportunities and help you meet like-minded people.\n\n3. **Build a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of purpose. Include activities that promote well-being, like exercise, meditation, or journaling.\n\n4. **Reconnect with People**: Try reaching out to old friends or family members. Even a simple text or call can help rebuild connections. You might also consider joining local groups or clubs related to your interests.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling stuck, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support. They can help you work through past decisions and plan for the future.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to make changes and improve your life. You're not alone in feeling lost, and taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Keep pushing forward!",
        "comment_gpt5": "31 isn’t old. You’re one structured year away from a very different life. Don’t try to fix everything at once—install a simple routine and let it compound.\n\nBody: keep fitness as your anchor. Fixed wake/bed time, morning sunlight, 30 min walk daily, lift 3–4x/week, phone charging outside the bedroom. Eat protein with each meal and drink water.\n\nMoney: run two tracks. Track A is fast income in 2 weeks (front desk at a gym, delivery, retail, labor) to stabilize. Track B is a path that helps people: personal training cert and coaching, caregiver/EMT, youth sports, or a trade/IT cert. Block two hours every weekday for job work: 5 targeted applications, 2 in‑person visits or calls, follow‑ups. Track it in a sheet.\n\nPeople: treat social skills as reps. This week, join one recurring in‑person thing and show up 8 weeks straight (rec sports, run club, climbing, church, volunteer shift, community class). Three small interactions a day. Text one old contact daily. Weekly call with your parents.\n\nService: volunteer 1–2x/week (food bank, senior center, animal shelter, youth coaching). You’ll feel useful and meet good people.\n\nDaily guardrails: 10‑minute tidy, 5‑minute journal (three wins and the one thing for tomorrow), 5‑minute mindfulness, sunlight. On bad days, do a “minimum day”: shower, 10‑minute walk, one application, one text, lights out on time. Use the two‑day rule—never miss twice. Limit alcohol/porn/doomscrolling; block apps if needed.\n\nGet help: book one therapy consult; look for sliding‑scale/community clinics if money is tight.\n\nDating: pause optimizing for it. Build a life you respect; the right people filter in when your routine is solid.\n\nStart today: shower, 30‑minute walk, simple resume, apply to three jobs, message one group to join, text one person, set a bedtime. Do that five days in a row. Review on Sunday and nudge it up."

      "body": "TL;DR-When you have been nothing all your life, what does it take for you to try and be better?\n\n(30-Age)\nAlright so this is long my apologise, I have ADD, Im lazy, undisciplined, prone to creating addictive behaviour out of many things, have little patience for myself. There are many more negative words I have in mind, but if seeing other posts have made something clear it is-Remove the labels if you want to work on yourself. Basically what im learning is that, you just have to do something and find yourself. Create better habits and actions, the problem with me is after watching myself repeat overtime I see this- I struggle to manage task and time, so I am frantically trying to get it all done, yet I don’t have enough energy. This lead to multiple things in life being started but rarely being finished. I know the answers here will be harsh, but they will be honest. I have so much self hate,  I truly am an empty vessel, what I mean is when I try to think of a future for myself a career to grow etc, its hard to envision. I try to see my passions and all I see is nothing, just me following what was near me. I am an over-thinker, yet I am very naïve and stupid, I have been so focused on being dead that starting over is hard. I realised the hardway that if I truly don’t want to do something then forcing myself to doesn’t last. I have finally decided to really try therapy and speaking to a doctor. Everyone else makes life look easy, so I figured im just weak, being depressed and anxiety prone is just untrained weakness. Yet the effort to build up is hard, mainly because I fully have to start over and im older so I don’t have the energy and excitement, unless im drinking coffee or on my meds. I grew up disliking myself for being a minority and stinted myself a lot. I have a fear of success and often sabotage or decline chances to grow because im not worth it. \nAnyhow sorry for  rant, I just know if this is my last chance then I really want to discover and unlock myself. I like helping others do that, but fail for myself.",

        "comment_gpt5": "Good call on seeing a doc/therapist. ADHD + depression make self‑regulation a skills problem, and skills are trainable with tiny reps.\n\nRun a 30‑day “minimum viable day.” Same wake time, every day. Get light and a 10‑minute walk right away. Take meds, drink water, eat some protein. Spend 5 minutes planning: brain‑dump everything, then pick one Most Important Thing and one tiny thing to finish. Do a single 25‑minute block on the MIT with your phone in another room and a timer running. If momentum shows up, do another block; if not, that one block still counts. Before you end the day, finish one thing end‑to‑end—pay a bill, send the email, wash the dishes, submit the form—so you close a loop. Do a 5‑minute reset at night to lay out clothes, clear your workspace, and write tomorrow’s MIT.\n\nExternalize everything. Keep one list and one calendar. Break work into the next physical action only. “Do resume” becomes “open Google Doc and write header.” Big goals live on the calendar as time blocks, not intentions.\n\nUse ADHD‑friendly scaffolding. Body doubling (friend, library, Focusmate), timers, and a website blocker during your blocks. Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing annoying: phone in another room, apps off your home screen, clothes and tools staged the night before.\n\nTrain finishing. New rule: you can’t start a new thing until you decide the fate of the current one—finish it now, schedule it, or drop it on purpose. Track a “done daily” streak on a calendar. Never miss twice.\n\nDo a 30‑minute weekly reset. Review wins, clear your list, choose next week’s three priorities, and remove obstacles in advance. Schedule your blocks like appointments.\n\nDon’t chase passion right now; chase consistency. Action creates clarity. Keep the floor low and boring; raise it only when it feels automatic. You’re not starting from nothing—you’re starting from experience. Run this for 30 days and see what sticks. Small, repeatable wins beat big bursts every time."

For small goals, consider simple pleasures like taking a relaxing walk, enjoying a favorite snack, or watching an episode of a show you love. If you're working on a bigger habit, you might save up for something more substantial, like a new book or a day trip. The important thing is to make sure the reward feels special and is something you genuinely look forward to. Keep it balanced, and you'll find it helps maintain your motivation and discipline over time. Keep up the great work!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Keep rewards small, immediate, and not at odds with the goal. Decide them before you start: “If I finish X, I get Y.” Y should take 2–15 minutes, happen right away, and not undo the win.\n\nGood micro-rewards: make a nice coffee/tea, 5–10 minutes of YouTube or social (timer on), a short walk/stretch, a hot shower, one song/dance break, five pages of a novel, switching to a fun task, or slapping a sticker on a visible streak. Do a quick little celebration to mark it—sounds silly, but it helps your brain tag the behavior as worth repeating.\n\nUse a points system for bigger stuff: each small goal = 1 point/$1; cash in weekly for a movie, takeout, or hobby gear. That keeps daily rewards modest and motivation steady.\n\nTemptation bundling works too: only listen to your favorite podcast during the chore/workout, or only watch a show right after the session.\n\nExample: finish one 25-min focus block → 5-min walk + streak mark. Four blocks → latte. Hit 5 days this week → add $10 to hobby fund. Set a timer for the reward, then back at it.\n\nAvoid rewards that fight the habit (junk food for diet goals, skipping workouts).

Now I'm at the point where I'm losing myself because of how confused and distraught I have allowed myself to become due to inaction one way or the other. How can I check my emotions to be able to think clearly and logically in order to be able to make the best decisions for myself? Any and all advice is appreciated.",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I'm not a therapist but I don't think you need to suppress your emotions, that will only make things worse. I think a better approach would be to process the emotions. You can even set up a time and date in your calendar to process those feelings, as if it were a meeting or appointment, that way you show up.\n\nThe advice given by others is good but I'd like to add some that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n1. Use the voice recorder on your phone and just talk, cry, whatever you need to. Talk to yourself or pretend you're talking to someone and let all the emotions out. Then after you can even try listening to the audio pretending you're listening to a friend venting since we tend to be harsher on ourselves but when it comes to others, we can be more patient and less judgmental. Then ask questions. Whether it's questions to fix the problem or questions that help you get to the root of things to try to heal on your own. (why do you feel this way, when was the last time you felt like this, where might this come from? Is there a pattern?, etc...it all depends on whether you want to brainstorm on how to fix a problem or if you wanna go back in your past and try to understand the why so then you give yourself some slack and actively start working on what you can control to change your situation)\n\nThat's what I do sometimes and it works. Just talking or recording yourself. Again, I'm no therapist. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.\n\n2. Sometimes I also try to pretend I'm my own daughter. No, I'm not a mother but I believe all humans want the best for their offspring, even if it's hypothetical ones. So, if you were your own daughter/son, as a parent, what would you think is best for your child? Do that.\n\n3. Meditation as well is very helpful. Set an intent before you meditate, state the question you want answered and then clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Your brain usually comes up with an answer during the meditation session or you stumble upon one days later. That also works for me.\n\nGood luck!",

        "comment_gpt4o": "It sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions, and it's great that you're looking to find a way to manage them better. One approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This doesn't mean suppressing your emotions but rather acknowledging them without letting them control your actions. Start by taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When emotions arise, notice them, but try not to judge or react immediately. This can help create a bit of space between feeling and action, allowing you to make more thoughtful decisions.\n\nAnother technique is to develop a habit of journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and see patterns in your emotional responses. Over time, this can give you more clarity and help you identify when your emotions might be clouding your judgment.\n\nLastly, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself that align with your logical decisions. This can help build confidence in your ability to act despite emotional turbulence. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're on the right path by seeking ways to improve, so keep at it!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need to suppress emotions; you need a repeatable process that keeps hot-state impulses from making cold-state decisions.\n\nUse a cooling-off rule. If intensity is 6/10 or higher, or the choice affects the next week+, impose a 24–48h delay. In that window: walk 10 minutes, do three rounds of 4-4-6 breathing, and write one sentence naming the feeling. Don’t hit send or buy or commit until the timer ends.\n\nMake if-then plans for your trigger situations. If I want to text someone when I’m upset, I draft it in Notes and revisit tomorrow. If I want to quit after a bad day, I wait until Sunday morning and review. Pre-commit these rules now and follow them like traffic lights.\n\nDecide with a checklist, not vibes. One page: facts vs story, what I control, three options, likely outcomes (most likely, not best case), and the 10/10/10 test—how will this feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Choose the option that wins for future-you.\n\nAdd guardrails. Remove shortcuts to bad moves (block numbers, delete payment autofill, app timers) and schedule a weekly “Decision Hour” to make big calls in a cold state.\n\nLower reactivity at the source. Daily: 10 minutes of mindfulness, 30 minutes of movement, consistent sleep and protein, less caffeine/alcohol. Keep a tiny decision log: trigger, what I did, result, tweak. Refine your rules weekly.\n\nStrong feelings aren’t the issue—lack of a system is. Build the system once, then let it do the heavy lifting."

        "best_comment": "I don't know if the experience is similar or not but I will share my incidents with exams.\n\nIn my third year, Few weeks before exams, I used to start worrying  and used to make a schedule. Then another day I used to procrastinate saying I will do it next day. Slowly the time went shorter and more fear gripped me, but I used to deliberately ignore them by distracting myself with social media, movies ,series, booze, friends etc . Then when there was little time left I started thinking I'm not gonna make it. Although some part of me was saying just do whatever you can do with remaining time , but there was gripping fear in one hand and comfort of distracting myself on another. I choosed comfort and spend watching Simpson with fear still inside of me.  In the end I didn't even went to give my exams \n\nFirstly you need some motivation and need to believe in yourself. You may not believe but I passed 3 major subjects of my final mbbs exams just by reading for a day. I hadnot touched books in years. I read while walking in room. I first read every points 3 -4 times then recalled it two times without looking at book. Then I used to speed revise hard topics in every few hours, like just taking a quick glance. In the morning I revised all of it with rapid speed reading.  In exam I could recall more than 60% \n\nSo whatever time you have left, believe me you can manage. The first and foremost thing is to get started ,once you complete some topics it will give you a boost, thats for sure  but that boost may lead to waste time , so first make a schedule of every hour and day. You may not meet all of it but it will keep you on track. \n\nIf you are finding really hard to start then try this. Think about the fear , think about the consequences, imagine the consequences, relate it with your past. Don't  distract yourself with comfort. I repeat it don't distracting yourself with comfort this time. Just meditate upon the thoughts. You may feel very bad , but do it. Face the fear completely  and feel the sense of responsibility. Have a hope that if I start it now I will make it. And trust me ,you will make it. \n\nNow you need a boost to motivate yourself past the fear. Get a cold shower, just stay in that shower for long time, saying I'm gonna do it. Once you complete it your mind will sense the result of your effort and motivate you somehow. Then just go and start it. \n\nGood luck bro , you can do it.",

        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty common issue, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. One thing that might help is breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of thinking about the entire assignment, focus on just starting with the first step, like reading the instructions or gathering your materials. This can make the task feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. \n\nAnother strategy is to set a timer for a short period, like 10 or 15 minutes, and commit to working for just that amount of time. Often, once you get started, you'll find it easier to keep going. Also, try to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or not be perfect on the first try. The important thing is to start and learn from the process. \n\nLastly, consider rewarding yourself for completing tasks, even the small ones. This can help create a positive association with getting things done. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need to get rid of the fear first. Start while scared, but make the start tiny and low‑stakes.\n\nTry a 5‑minute start ritual: sit down, open the doc/book, set a 5:00 timer, and do the smallest physical action—write the title, list 3 things you know, or attempt problem #1. When the timer ends you can stop guilt‑free. Often you’ll keep going; if not, that still counts and makes the next start easier.\n\nUse “ugly first pass.” Your first session’s job is to produce something bad on purpose: a messy outline, rough bullet points, or wrong attempts. You’re gathering clay, not grading it.\n\nCreate early micro‑deadlines. Within 24 hours of getting an assignment, do a 10‑minute “touch”: read the prompt, highlight the action words, jot one question, and write the next physical step. Put that next step on your calendar for a 20–25 minute block and treat it like an appointment.\n\nAdd light accountability. Study with a friend, library body‑double, or text someone “25 on [task], starting now” and “done” after.\n\nWhen you freeze, shrink your world to the next 20‑second move: open the file, type the header, copy the prompt, write one ugly sentence. Do that, then the next.\n\nMake this a daily habit. Track starts, not perfection. Small, consistent reps beat last‑minute adrenaline, and the fear shrinks as you rack up starts."

I have a low paying job that doesn't translate to anything useful. I have zero interest. I have zero real life experience. I hate everything about my life and most of the time I only think about either commiting suicide or hoping I die peacefully. \n\nIt's not like I didn't try. When I went to college I tried getting into a decent STEM field, but because I was a dumbass I couldn't even pass basic math, so I flunked the barrier to entry for basically every major that's worth attending college for. Instead I got a journalism degree which is the worst decision I have ever made in my life. There are no jobs for this field and now they lowered the requirements to allow even high school grads to get the jobs so now it is literally a useless degree. So at this point I am 30k in debt as well from a dogshit degree that I regret everyday I wake up. \n\nI have no idea what to really do because I mostly hate life and everything about it. I'm tired of popping anti depressants that only keep me just above water in terms of mental stability because without them I can't even sleep because I have rapid thoughts of suicidal and sometimes even homicidal ideation in my head. \n\nHow can I turn my life around while also trying to focus and push through my own mental state.\n\nEdit: I didn't think I would get a huge response from this post so I want to thank everyone who posted.

        "best_comment": "26 is young. Plenty of time to turn your life around. Figure out what you want out of life and work backwards. If you're most people, what you want will involve some amount of money and working on your social skills.\n\nLife is short, but it's longer than you think. The secret to nearly everyone's success (except the very lucky) is consistency.\n\nFigure out what you want - it doesn't have to be something huge like world peace. It could be \"to travel the world\" or \"to buy a house\" or \"get married and raise a family\" or as simple as \"get a job that lets you live comfortably\". Figure out what it is.\n\nConsistency compounds quickly. Reaching your goal may only take a couple years depending - if you really stick to it. Then you can move on to the next thing, maybe something bigger. Being successful itself is a skill - the more you are successful and reach your own goals - the easier it is to be successful. Just decide what's important to you and start today, then do it every day.\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller chunks - if it's get a good job maybe that involves picking a skill you can self-teach fairly easily, then committing to that skill and the job search. If it's getting a girlfriend, maybe that includes getting into good shape and improving your social skills. The point is - pick one thing, right now, and stick to it. \n\nThe secret is consistency and you feel the way you feel because you have not been consistent in developing any aspects of your life up to this point. That's okay. In 3 years time your life can be entirely different and nearly unrecognizable. You could be thirty and in a happy relationship with a good job doing what you want. The only difference between that version of you and today is the little bit of work you put in every single day between now and then.\n\nAnd if I had to recommend a self-taught job to go from 0 to 100k salary - there are thousands of jobs for front-end JS developers on the market right now - and hundreds of free resources to learn how to be a front end developer. If I was in your position, I would start there.",

Many people have felt stuck and found a way forward, and you can too. \n\nLet's start small. It might help to focus on building a routine that gives you a sense of control and accomplishment. Start with something simple, like setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 10 minutes a day to a new hobby or skill. It doesn't have to be perfect or big, just something that you can stick to and gradually build on.\n\nConsider exploring interests outside of your current job. There are tons of free resources online to learn new skills, whether it's coding, graphic design, or even something like cooking. This could open up new opportunities and help you discover what you enjoy.\n\nAlso, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a game-changer. They can provide support and strategies tailored to your situation. It's great that you're already on medication, but therapy can offer additional tools to help manage those tough thoughts.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small.

        "comment_gpt5": "First: if you’re in immediate danger or feel close to acting on the suicidal or homicidal thoughts, call your local emergency number or go to the ER now. You can also call/text 988 (US), 116 123 (UK/Ireland), 1‑833‑456‑4566 (Canada), 13 11 14 (AU), or find local options at findahelpline dot com. Keep your prescriber in the loop about these thoughts.\n\nNow, a simple, discipline-first plan you can start today.\n\nTwo-week “minimum viable day” (no-zero days):\n- Same wake time daily, phone outside the bedroom. Make the bed.\n- 20‑minute walk outside.\n- Take meds, drink water, eat one protein-heavy meal.\n- 10‑minute tidy.\nEverything else is bonus. Put an X on a calendar for each day you hit these. Streaks > intensity.\n\nNext 30–90 days: pick one practical path and sprint.\n- IT help desk: study CompTIA A+ (free Professor Messer/YT), build basic labs, apply to help desk/desktop support.\n- Skilled trades apprentice (electrician/HVAC/plumbing): apply to unions/shops; paid training.\n- CDL/delivery (trucking, UPS/USPS): short training, stable work.\n- Use your writing: copywriting/content ops/grant writing. Make 3 portfolio samples (e.g., product page, how‑to, nonprofit brief) in Notion/GDocs, learn basic SEO (free Google/Coursera), apply.\n\nDaily “power block” (90 minutes, timer on): 3 applications, 3 skill reps (lesson/lab/sample), 3 reach‑outs (email/DM/in‑person). Do it before noon, then you’ve already won the day.\n\nWeekly (1 hour): review your calendar X’s, adjust next week’s targets, prep your environment (clothes out, desk clear, websites blocked during the power block). Tiny friction changes > willpower.\n\nDebt: put federal loans on income-driven repayment at studentaid.gov and autopay minimums. You can attack balances once income rises.\n\nSocial: one small connection per day (text a friend, chat with a coworker, volunteer once a week). Momentum loves people.\n\nDo today: schedule a prescriber check‑in, print a calendar, take the 20‑minute walk, pick your path (A/B/C/D), and set tomorrow’s 90‑minute block. Repeat for a week, then a month. Discipline is built by showing up small and often—let the streaks carry you. You’re not behind; you’re starting now."

        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not supposed to do everything every day. People who look like they “do it all” are prioritizing a few things, giving the rest a minimum dose, batching chores, and rotating focus over seasons.\n\nPick 2–3 priorities for the next 8–12 weeks (e.g., work/study, fitness). Everything else gets a small, repeatable minimum or gets benched for now. That’s not failure; it’s how adults manage finite time and energy.\n\nBuild a simple daily template with caps so it’s sustainable. One 60–90 min deep study block with the phone away. One health block (45 min workout or a 20 min walk + a few sets at home). One 15–30 min home reset. Add a tiny creative block like 10–20 min piano stacked to a trigger you already do (after dinner, after brushing teeth). Use timers; when time is up, stop.\n\nBatch and automate. Groceries once a week with a standard list or delivery. Cook 2–3 big batches and reheat. Do a daily 15 min tidy and one weekly 60 min clean. Read via audiobooks while commuting/cleaning. Make movies a weekend treat, not a daily item.\n\nPrevent “forgetting” with cues: alarms, calendar time-blocks, checklist on the fridge, piano left open and visible, gym bag by the door. Use “never zero”: if you’re wiped, do 5 minutes and call it a win. Consistency > intensity.\n\nReview weekly. If something isn’t happening, shrink the minimum or move it to the bench and rotate it back in next season. At 22, you have time; you’ll do most things across months, not all at once in a day.\n\nDo fewer things better, on purpose, with systems. That’s how you “do everything.”"

I'm gonna give you what I did to myself and maybe you can take parts of it and apply to yourself. Basically breaking it down it went:\n\n1. Assess my current situation\n2. Map out where I want to be in 1 year from now on, and what is my ideal self\n3. Create SMART goals \n4. Do a daily review of the day\n\n**Assess the situation**.  \nThis is where you want to assess what it is that your currently doing in your life to know which parts to reduce and what to start improving.  \nI started by drawing out a big Chart, where i marked  \nInfrequent on the left side of the chart, and frequent on the right side  \nThen i marked little on the bottom side of the chart, and Alot on the top side.  \nAfter that i started to plot in my daily habbits. What do i actually do often that has a big impact on my life, good or bad. For instance I spent alot of time working overtime, eating unhealthy and watching youtube, where as i spent alot less time reading books, going to the gym and working on sideprojecs.\n\nThis gave me a good overview of my current situation and let me know which of my daily habits that we're the biggest issues in my life.\n\n**Map out your ideal self**  \nI basically made a mindmap consisting of me in the middle with parts, Family & Social, Career, Health, Economy. Here I basically maped out in an ideal world, what would I do, what would I look like, what would my relationships with others be like. I did it for my ideal self and also another version for 1 year from now on. This gave me quite a boost of motivation to actually know where I ideally would want to take things. No actions planed, just a vision of what I want my life to be like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SMART Goals**  \nWay to many times I've created goals and never followed up. SMART goals enable me to make my goals more tangible by making sure my goals are very specific, that they're measurable(how else can i expect to know if i've achived them), Achiveable - I can't expect to be a worldclass athlete in 1 year, but I can start going to the gym 15 times a month.  \nRelevant, I don't want to set a goal of losing x amount of pounds, but rather focusing on living a long life for my family. Timebound, this is to give myself a deadline of when this needs to be achived, which makes you accountable.   \n\n\n**Daily Review**  \nThe hardest part of making sure this new routine sticks is def in the begining I just made a simple spreadsheet where i put in my goals, and date, and when i Achive them i mark the day as green, and when i fail i mark it as red. It feels awesome to mark a day as green, and it also gives myself a remainder each day of the goals that I've set up for myself.  \n\n\nSo these are the 4 steps that I took to get back on track and start rehauling my life.

Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to feel a bit lost. Here are a few ideas to help you get started on your journey:\n\n1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small, manageable goals that can help build your confidence. It could be something like reading a book related to a skill you want to develop or setting aside 10 minutes a day to practice a new hobby.\n\n2. **Skill Development**: Consider online courses or workshops that can help you gain new skills. Websites like Coursera or Udemy offer affordable courses in various fields. This could open up new job opportunities and help you feel more accomplished.\n\n3. **Networking**: Since you're shy, try online communities related to your interests. They can be a less intimidating way to connect with others and might even lead to friendships or job opportunities.\n\n4. **Routine and Self-Care**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care. This could be exercise, meditation, or simply a moment to relax. Taking care of yourself can improve your self-esteem over time.\n\n5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. This can help build your self-worth and motivate you to keep going.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're already on the right path by reaching out and seeking advice. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your way. 😊",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not starting from zero. You have a degree, admin experience, and you already took action with the dance class. Here’s a simple, doable reset that builds momentum fast.\n\nFor the next 8 weeks, run a “one habit, one skill, one social rep” plan. Every day, do a 20–30 min walk or basic workout to anchor your day; do a 30–45 min focused skill block for career upgrade before work or right after; do one tiny social action. Track these three boxes on paper and aim to never miss twice.\n\nPick one path for your skill block and commit to it for 8 weeks. Easiest pay bump from admin is toward operations/project coordination or data/reporting. If you like organizing people/tasks, do the Google Project Management cert on Coursera and build a simple portfolio: a mock project plan, timeline, risk log. If you don’t mind numbers, do advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, PowerQuery) plus a basic SQL intro; build one small dashboard from a public dataset. Free resources: Leila Gharani on YouTube for Excel, freeCodeCamp for SQL. Keep it boringly consistent: same time, timer on, phone away.\n\nStart job moves in week 3 while you’re still learning. Update your resume to highlight outcomes (e.g., “coordinated X, cut turnaround by Y%, managed Z invoices/week”). Aim 5–10 tailored applications a week for roles like Project Coordinator, Operations Coordinator, Customer Success Associate, HR/Recruiting Coordinator, Reporting Analyst/Business Ops. Do two 15‑minute coffee chats a week on LinkedIn with people in those roles; ask what they actually do, what tools they use, and what junior wins look like.\n\nLeverage dance class as your social rep. Show up 10 minutes early and say one line to two people each session: “Hey, I’m [name], how long have you been coming?” Learn names; on week 3, ask one person, “Want to practice after class or grab tea?” Consistency plus small asks beats waiting for confidence.\n\nMake the routine easy to keep. Set clothes out the night before, block distracting sites during your skill block, put your phone in another room, and do a 2‑minute “bare minimum” version on rough days. Do a 20‑minute Sunday review: check your streak, choose next week’s lessons, line up applications, and plan which class you’ll attend.\n\nSelf‑esteem follows evidence. Keep small promises, rack up reps, and let the wins compound. Eight weeks from now you’ll have better habits, a clearer skill story, and applications in flight. You’ve got this—keep it simple and keep showing up."

I'm also in a new job so I'm constantly worried about underperforming while actually underperforming which further adds to the worrying. Here's what my week looks like - \n\nMonday to Thursday is a struggle to get through. I sleep 8-9 hours, struggle to wake up the next day and count the hours before it's time to sleep again. I wake up happy on Friday, work for 3-4 hours, and then just fuck around for the rest of the day. This part of the weekend is my personal favorite. I'm not too excited because it is still technically a work day but I'm also not drowned out by the fast approaching Monday. Saturday is hype but it's way, way too short and the 18-20 hours I'm awake usually feel like 3-4 hours of productive fun. Sunday first half is mostly recovering from the previous day, and the second half can be best described as pure irrational mental agony. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI want to stop glorifying the weekends and want to live a more balanced life where I look forward to each day and where I am not trying to maximize entertainment over the weekend. \n\nMy current way of living has also gotten me into some weird mental health situations, for example I now depend on food to cope with feeling sad. I've been overweight all my life and this is greatly accelerating the problem. Also, I stay in bed for 9-10 hours because my mind refuses to get out of bed after 8 hours.\n\nHow do I accept that this is what life is going to be for the next 35-40 years and respect each day equally regardless of how boring/fun it is going to be?",

        "best_comment": "I personally don't think that discipline is what is going to fix your situation. Unless your long work hours are imposed by WFH hurting your mindset and making it easy to slack off, then maybe so. If that's the case, I recommend you look for things to do outside of work. WFH makes a lot of us feel really repressed, so maybe you would enjoy to start going for walks in the morning. That could be something to motivate you to get out of bed for example. Try to give your day some structure, like a kind of schedule. It doesn't have to hour-by-hour, just whatever works for you. You could start reorganizing yourself by simply adding one new habit at a time.\n\nI can't speak for your career because you know your situation, but if it is your job putting you through this, maybe looking for a new one is a good option. Even if the paycheck is less, decreased stress will improve your quality of life much more than the pay difference",
        "percentile_10_comment": "You need discipline, a hobby and work-life balance. The discipline will allow you to set personal targets at work and structure your days accordingly and finish at a reasonable time (8.30-5.30 works well for me with 30 mins for lunch and a few 10-15 min breaks throughout the day). Your hobby/hobbies allow you to have an actual life outside of work on the evenings (soccer, gym, DnD.. Whatever - just try and pick something that takes you out of the house since you WFH). The combination of a disciplined work day and a hobby or planned evening gives you work life balance (voila!).",
        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, but it's great that you're looking to make a change. Here are a few ideas that might help you find more balance and enjoyment in your weekdays:\n\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each day. This could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk or reading a chapter of a book. These small wins can help break the monotony and give you something to look forward to.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a morning routine that energizes you. It could be a quick workout, meditation, or a healthy breakfast. A consistent routine can make waking up easier and set a positive tone for the day.\n\n3. **Limit Work Hours**: If possible, set boundaries for your work hours. Communicate with your employer about your workload and see if there's a way to manage it better. It's important to have time for yourself outside of work.\n\n4. **Mindful Eating**: Since food is a coping mechanism for you, try to practice mindful eating. Pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel. This can help you develop a healthier relationship with food.\n\n5. **Plan Weekday Activities**: Schedule small activities during the week that you enjoy. It could be a hobby, a virtual hangout with friends, or a new recipe to try. Having something to look forward to can make weekdays more enjoyable.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies to manage stress and improve your mental health.\n\nRemember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. You're taking a positive step by seeking advice, and that's a great start!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t have to “accept” 9–9 misery for 40 years. Make weekdays worth living and put guardrails around work.\n\nAt work: ask your manager for clear weekly priorities. “What are the top 3 outcomes for me this week? What does ‘good’ look like?” Time-block two 60–90 min deep‑work blocks before lunch, then do meetings/admin. Set a hard stop (e.g., 6:30) and a 10‑minute shutdown ritual: capture loose ends, plan tomorrow, close the laptop. On Friday, write Monday’s top 3 so the weekend isn’t a countdown to dread.\n\nWFH separation: create a “fake commute.” Short walk, then sit at a specific workspace. Change into “work clothes” and out of them at shutdown. In the morning, fix a consistent wake time, put the alarm across the room, turn on bright light, drink water, do 3 minutes of movement, then do 10 minutes on the hardest task. Momentum beats motivation.\n\nFood: pick simple default meals and keep protein/produce prepped. Remove trigger snacks from the house. Use a 10‑minute delay on cravings, then plate a portion if you still want it. Eat at a table, not at your desk. “Kitchen closed” after dinner.\n\nMove daily. A 20–30 minute brisk walk or bodyweight circuit (and sunlight) will help mood, sleep, and appetite regulation. Do it at the same time each day.\n\nAdd weekday joy on purpose. Schedule 30–60 minutes Mon–Thu for something you enjoy (hobby, call a friend, sport, reading). Treat it like a meeting. Stop saving all fun for Saturday.\n\nTame the Sunday scaries with a 20‑minute reset (or do it Friday): plan Monday’s top 3, lay out clothes, tidy a bit, and schedule a small Monday treat.\n\nTrack a simple scoreboard Mon–Thu: deep‑work blocks done, moved, ate to plan, shutdown complete, 30–60 min joy. Hit 4/5 and call it a good day. String good days; the week improves.\n\nRun this as a 14‑day experiment. If you still must work 9–9 to stay afloat, that’s a role/culture issue—start planning an exit. You deserve weekdays you don’t need to escape from."

      "body": "Hi guys,\nI’m 21F who has struggled with severe social anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. It’s bad because i’ve let it go on for too long. Luckily, I recently enrolled in a serious program. I’ve been able to stick with it, everyday, for a month now. It was cognitive strategies at first, and now it’s getting into behavioral things. Going out and socializing. Exposure to my fear. And I can’t help but be upset at myself because I can feel myself slipping into depression atm, which is a symptom of my SA, because I feel like I can’t do this.\n\nBut I want it so bad. Tonight I was sitting in bed after scrolling on my phone for hours and I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I need things to change. I have a list of 4 things I want to do everyday (therapy program, meditation, work out, and doing one social thing as simple as going into a store). The thing is I don’t wanna slip. Because for me, slipping even once is a huge fall back into my depression and isolation.\n\nFor any of you who have successfully achieved your goals and stuck to a schedule, how did you do it? Are there apps that can help, communities that hold you strongly accountable, a method or something you discovered that finally made you not quit? Especially those of you who have a mental illness, how did you stop it from getting in your way? Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna start tomorrow.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the amazing advice. I feel very motivated and supported. :)",

        "best_comment": "Having a structure like your program is a huge help. It gives you something to grasp onto and you slide into and out of depression. \n\nOne thing I will say is that it’s a journey. It’s going to take awhile. You are going to take some steps forward and some steps back. It’s completely normal so try to not beat yourself up about it. It’s going to happen, it’s going to be ok, and it does get better. \n\nFor myself, what has made the most difference is to not a ridged, self-enforced schedule. I can’t ever do it well enough for that to fix anything. The self-anger from messing up just Leads to more depression. What I can do is try to break away from my daily life as much as possible. I see new things, even if I am alone. I go to a local bar a few times a week. It was awkward at first but someone will take you under their wing at some point and give you the comfort to get to know others there.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "Every time I get into a rut, I realize my sleep has been poor. \n\nI’m not naive and condescending enough to suggest sleep is the only thing that’s making you feel bad. But it’s a good place to start when trying to get on track. \n\nProtect your sleep. Do that by:\n\n- Going to bed at the same time every night. \n- Waking up at the same time every day. (For the most part.)\n- Getting up when your alarm goes off. (I have one old-school alarm in my bedroom and my phone alarm set for one minute later out in the kitchen. Also, my bedroom alarm is an ascending beep, meaning it starts at low volume and gradually increases.)\n- Protecting yourself from screens for an hour before you go to bed. (This is an important one. Even with apps that protect you from blue light, the screen is still too much stimulation before bed. Give yourself an hour, even if you’re not really doing anything in that hour.)\n\nAlso, allow yourself to break one of these rules on occasion. Be disciplined, but don’t be rigid. That will help break you of the all-or-nothing mindset that causes you to feel you’ve lost all progress when you screw up once. \n\nProtecting your sleep is easy and makes you feel better, period.",
        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, kudos to you for taking such proactive steps with your program and recognizing the need for change. That's a huge first step. When it comes to sticking with your goals, especially when dealing with mental health challenges, consistency and small wins are key. \n\nStart by breaking down your list into even smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if going to a store feels overwhelming, maybe start with just stepping outside for a few minutes. Celebrate these small victories because they build momentum. \n\nApps like Habitica or Streaks can be great for tracking habits and keeping you motivated. They turn habit-building into a game, which can make it more engaging. Also, consider joining online communities or forums where you can share your progress and get support from others who understand what you're going through. \n\nRemember, it's okay to have off days. The important thing is to not let a slip turn into a fall. Be kind to yourself and focus on getting back on track the next day. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Huge props on sticking with the program for a month—that’s real momentum.\n\nWhat helped me stop sliding was a floor/ceiling setup. Floor = tiny version that always counts; ceiling = do more if you feel good. For your four: program 5 minutes or one exercise from the module; meditation 2 minutes; workout 5 minutes or one set/walk around the block; social = enter a store, ask one question or buy one item. On rough days, do only the floor and check it off. That prevents the all-or-nothing spiral.\n\nAnchor them to cues, not motivation. After breakfast do the program, immediately sit for meditation, before shower do the workout, by 6pm do the store errand. Decide exact times tonight and write them down. If-then plan: if it’s 6pm and the social thing isn’t done, I go to the nearest store, buy gum, ask one question, leave.\n\nFollow “never miss twice.” If you miss, do the floor the very next morning and you’re back on track.\n\nLight accountability helps. Focusmate for body-doubling while you do the program/workout, or text a friend “4/4 done” nightly. If you like stakes: Beeminder or StickK. Track with Streaks (iOS) or Loop (Android); TickTick/Todoist if you want scheduling; Habitica if you like gamified checkboxes. For the scrolling trap: One Sec/Forest/Freedom, and charge your phone away from the bed.\n\nMake starts frictionless: lay out workout clothes, pre-open the program module, prep a one-line store script. End each day with a 1-minute check-in: what got done, what’s tomorrow’s plan.\n\nYou’ve got momentum. Start tomorrow with the floor versions, then let wins snowball if you have extra energy."

Since you mentioned a past interest in physical sciences, maybe revisiting that could reignite some excitement. You could start by taking an online course or joining a local science club to see if it still sparks your interest. Also, your skills in problem-solving and creating could be a great fit for fields like data analysis or product development, where you can see the impact of your work. As for your idea about self-help videos or daily routines on YouTube, it sounds promising! It could be a way to connect with people and share your journey, which aligns with your values. Just start small, maybe with a few videos, and see how it feels. Remember, finding your passion is often about trying new things and being open to where they might lead. Good luck!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t “find” passion—you build it by doing reps on a problem you care about. Give yourself 12 weeks and run two focused experiments, then let data (not mood) decide.\n\nPick two hypotheses that fit your values and skills. First: evidence-based science/health communication. Start a simple channel breaking down health products and popular claims with sources and first principles. Two short videos a week for six weeks, phone only, your own audio/design, no perfectionism. After each week, score four things: energy (1–10), learning (1–10), audience response (views/comments/saves), and a revenue path you feel good about. Second: applied consumer insights with implementation. Find a small business or nonprofit, take one measurable problem from insight to action: do quick research, propose a change, implement, report results. Track the same four numbers. This tests your “impact beyond analysis” box.\n\nIf physical sciences still tug at you, do a 4‑week taste test: one MOOC with problem sets and a tiny project, 60–90 minutes daily. If you like the grind (not just the idea), plan a deeper cert or part‑time path; if not, you’ve closed a loop.\n\nDaily structure: one 90‑minute deep‑work block (phone in another room), ship something publicly every week, and a 30‑minute Sunday review to score energy/learning/response/revenue and decide to tweak, keep, or kill. Book five informational chats across these paths this month to see real day‑to‑day.\n\nAlign your current biz with your honesty value: only sell what you’d buy and can back with evidence, or pivot to transparent reviews/affiliates. That pairs well with path one and lets you connect with people while using psych/econ/research and your audio/design skills.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, pick the path with the best combo of energy + traction and commit 12 months. Put blinders on and stick to the block/ship/review cadence. If you want to test YouTube now, do a 30‑day daily short (your routine or “myth of the day”). Done > perfect. Let the reps tell you what’s yours."

I was vounrable all the time thinking it was ok to show her my real feelings.I know it was my fault. I just don't want to be that person anymore.

Journaling is another great tool; it can help you process your thoughts and track your progress over time.\n\nPhysically, consider setting a simple fitness goal.

Wake at the same time every day. Get 10 minutes of outside light and a short walk. Do 5–10 minutes of breathing or mindfulness (count breaths to 10, repeat). Write your top 3 tasks for the day. Train your body: follow a plan like StrongLifts 5x5 or Couch to 5K; lift or run 3–4 days/week and walk on the others. Eat real meals with protein, hydrate, and go to bed at the same time with your phone out of the room. End the day with a 5-minute reflection: what went well, what didn’t, one thing to improve tomorrow.\n\nFor 30 days, go no contact and remove reminders. Cut alcohol/weed/porn; they make mood regulation harder. When emotions spike, use a tiny protocol: name it (“sad/angry”), take five slow breaths, then do the next physical task on your list. You’re training the gap between feeling and action.\n\nUse the “never miss twice” rule. If you slip, reset on the next rep, not next week. Do a 20-minute weekly review on Sunday to plan the next seven days.\n\nIf you can, add a few therapy sessions—it’s coaching for your mind. Six weeks of this will feel different.

        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not too far gone. Lots of adults get a GED and go on to college.\n\nStart by checking which exam your state uses: GED or HiSET. Go to GED.com or hiset.org, make an account, see your state’s rules, and take an official practice test to see where you’re starting. Then call your local community college or school district and ask for their adult education/GED prep program. Most are free or low cost, include diagnostics, tutoring, and can help with testing accommodations if you suspect a learning disability.\n\nBuild a simple, consistent study routine. Same time every day, phone on airplane mode, 45–90 minutes, 5–6 days a week. Use Khan Academy for math (arithmetic → prealgebra → algebra basics), GED RLA modules for reading/writing, and CrashCourse plus GED practice for science/social studies. Focus on one subject at a time. Book a test date 4–6 weeks out for the easiest subject first (often RLA or Social Studies), use the “GED Ready” practice to confirm you’re ready, take it, then move to the next. Deadlines create momentum.\n\nIn parallel, talk to a nearby community college admissions office now. Ask about start dates, placement testing, tutoring, and disability services. Many have GED-to-college bridge programs. Fill out FAFSA at studentaid.gov as soon as you can; at 24 you’re considered independent, which often helps with aid. Ask admissions about their GED deadline for spring enrollment and plan backwards.\n\nFor discipline, make one clear daily rule: “At X time, I sit at my desk and do two 25‑minute study blocks.” Prep your materials beforehand, track your streak on a calendar, and do a “never zero” minimum of 10 minutes on hard days. Get accountability by checking in weekly with a friend or in a study thread.\n\nToday’s first steps: make the GED/HiSET account, call the adult-ed program, and do a 30‑minute study session. Keep it simple and steady; this is absolutely doable."

Do a 48–72h deload: prioritize 8–9h sleep, morning sunlight + a 30–45 min walk, real meals, light movement, minimal screens, and pause caffeine. That’s how you actually recharge.\n\nThen rebuild with a low floor: start with 3 Pomodoros (25/5) a day, move during breaks, and stop when you planned, not when you’re wrecked. Add one block only after a strong day. Make the dry lectures active: stop transcribing; for each proof jot Goal, Assumptions, Key Step, and Why It Works. Pause to predict the next line. After class, close notes and re-derive from memory; make a few flashcards for defs/lemmas; say it out loud to a study buddy or in office hours.\n\nCoffee stopped working because of tolerance—take a 5–7 day reset, then one cup early only. A 15–20 min caffeine nap beats chugging all day. Don’t study in bed; switch to a library/whiteboard or different seat, and let Netflix be a reward after your planned blocks with a hard stop. If the physical heaviness sticks around after a week of sleep + deload, talk to a doctor and loop in your advisor."

No, I am not going to clean my entire house, but I can go unload the dishwasher real quick.

This one might sound silly, but to curb my place from becoming a disorganized mess, when I have things out or finish making a meal etc, I actually say aloud “Don’t put it down- put it away.” This forces me to physically not let go of an object until it is back in its place. \n\nMaybe these will help you move forward.

The key is to build momentum with small wins.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do, focus on one thing at a time. Use a planner or an app to keep track of your tasks and prioritize them.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, rest, and leisure. Consistency is crucial in building discipline.\n\n4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and find ways to minimize these interruptions. This might mean setting specific times to check your phone or social media.\n\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but don't beat yourself up over it. Celebrate your small victories and understand that building discipline is a gradual process.\n\nThis subreddit is definitely a good place for your post, and you'll find a lot of people here who have been in your shoes.

However, I usually reach home by 7-7:30pm. I recently moved into a 1bhk and set it up completely( a first for me). I realised that my eating habits were not healthy and very expensive as I would order everything from outside, so I decided to start cooking for myself. However, it takes a lot of my time and it’s very difficult to manage with work, even if I try making simple things. I know I can cut vegetables and everything from before and keep for a while. But everything is taking so much of my mind space. I think more about food and shopping for food rather than work. I also don’t have a maid currently and am doing the dishes and house cleaning on my own. I can afford a maid(it’s cheap in India) but I don’t want to coz I have had bad experiences before in Delhi and it’s another hassle to manage. \nI just want to know how to save time physically and mentally and concentrate on my work while also cooking for myself and also getting some me time along with some workout in the morning .\nIs it too much to ask ?

        "comment_gpt4o": "Managing work, housework, and personal time can definitely feel overwhelming, but with a few tweaks, you can make it more manageable. First, consider meal prepping on weekends. Spend a couple of hours cooking and storing meals for the week. This way, you only need to reheat food after work, saving you time and mental energy. You can also try batch cooking grains or proteins that can be mixed and matched with different veggies or sauces throughout the week.\n\nSince you’re open to waking up earlier, try gradually setting your alarm 10-15 minutes earlier each day until you reach your desired wake-up time. This can give you a bit more time in the morning for a quick workout or some \"me time\" without feeling rushed.\n\nFor housework, creating a simple cleaning schedule can help. Break tasks into small, daily chores instead of letting them pile up. For example, do dishes right after meals and dedicate 10-15 minutes each day to tidying up a specific area. This keeps your space clean without feeling like a huge burden.\n\nLastly, if managing a maid is too much, consider hiring one for just a couple of days a week to handle the heavier cleaning tasks. This could free up some of your time and reduce stress without the full commitment.\n\nRemember, it’s all about finding a balance that works for you. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Good luck!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Not too much to ask. The fix is a small system and a few defaults so food and chores stop taking mental space.\n\nPick a simple 2‑week rotation of weekday meals and just repeat. Think dal‑chawal + quick sabzi, khichdi + dahi, egg/paneer bhurji + roti, veg pulao + raita, poha/upma or oats for breakfast, dosa/idli from store batter when you want variety. No new recipes on weekdays.\n\nDo prep twice: Sunday ~90 min and Wednesday ~45 min. Cook a pot of dal, one sabzi, and a grain; make a big onion‑tomato‑ginger‑garlic masala base and freeze in cubes; cook/boil chana/rajma and freeze portions; keep boiled eggs; buy semi‑cooked rotis or freeze your own; keep frozen peas/mixed veg. Run pressure cooker and rice cooker together so you can tidy while they work.\n\nWeeknight flow should be 30 minutes max: start rice/khichdi, reheat dal with fresh tadka, quick stir‑fry or bhurji, eat, then a 10‑minute “sink to zero.” Limit yourself to one pan + one pot to cut dishes. If daily cooking still feels heavy, use a tiffin for lunch 2–3 days and only cook dinner.\n\nPut groceries on autopilot: a recurring BigBasket/Zepto order for staples + veg twice a week, a standing list in Notes, and place orders during lunch at work. Keep two “emergency” meals on hand (curd rice; eggs + toast; frozen paratha + bhurji) to avoid last‑minute Swiggy.\n\nCleaning = tiny loops: 10‑minute nightly reset, 5‑minute bathroom wipe after your morning shower, one laundry load on fixed days, 30‑minute weekly sweep/mop. If deep cleaning drains you, book Urban Company once every 2–4 weeks—less hassle than managing a daily maid.\n\nYou don’t need a super‑early wake. With 8 am: 8:05–8:25 a home workout (yoga, bodyweight, skipping), 8:25–8:45 shower/breakfast, carry lunch from your prep. Evenings: 20 minutes to decompress, 30 minutes cook/eat, 10 minutes reset, then me‑time. Protect the reset and bedtime; they make everything else easier.\n\nGive yourself one tiffin or takeout day guilt‑free. Track just three habits—prep, workout, nightly reset—on a tiny checklist and aim for 5/7. Consistency beats perfection, and this setup will free both time and headspace fast."

        "comment_gpt5": "You don’t need more willpower; you need a simple system that makes overspending harder and saving automatic.\n\nOn payday, pay yourself first. Set an automatic transfer to a separate savings account you can’t instantly spend from. Then split what’s left into two checking accounts: one for bills/needs, one for “fun.” Pick a weekly fun amount and move it there every Monday (or use cash). Spend that guilt‑free; when it’s gone, you’re done until next week.\n\nAdd friction to impulse buys. Delete shopping apps, unsubscribe from promos, remove saved cards, turn off one‑click/Apple Pay, and keep your card at home when you don’t need it. Create a waiting rule: 24 hours for anything under $50, 7 days for bigger stuff. Keep a “Want Later” note on your phone; if you still want it after the wait and it fits the fun budget, buy it.\n\nUse an if‑then plan for mood spending. “If I get the urge to buy because I’m upset, then I start a 10‑minute timer and do X instead (walk, shower, journal five lines, call a friend). When the timer ends, I put the item on my list and wait.” Most urges pass.\n\nTrack quickly, not perfectly. Jot every purchase in a phone note. Do a 10‑minute weekly review: did I stay within fun money, anything to return, what needs adjusting next week?\n\nMake your goals visible. Name your savings “Emergency Fund” or “New Laptop,” watch it grow, and aim to beat your previous balance each payday. Getting a win from progress makes it easier to skip impulse hits.\n\nIf you slip, return what you can, reset the allowance next week, move on. Try this for 30 days and post an update; accountability helps. The combo of automatic saving, a small allowance, friction, and a cooldown rule works."

Be in bed 8 hours before that. Phone charges outside the bedroom. Do a 5‑minute tidy before bed.\n- Food defaults: delete Uber Eats and remove saved cards. For one week eat the same simple breakfast and lunch (e.g., eggs + toast; Greek yogurt + fruit; rotisserie chicken + salad kit). Buy only what you’ll eat in 3 days. Rule: eat your default first, then decide if you still want something else after 10 minutes.\n- Movement: 10 minutes daily, knee‑friendly (gentle walk, bike, or seated/upper‑body work). If you can, add basic knee rehab from a PT, but keep the habit tiny first.\n- Mornings: pack bag and lay out clothes the night before. Leave 15 minutes earlier. Uber only if you’re 15+ minutes late after leaving on time. Track zero‑Uber days.\n- Environment and money: 10‑minute nightly reset (trash, dishes, laundry in hamper). Transfer every dollar you don’t spend on Uber/UE into a “buffer” account. Apply a 30‑day rule on the gaming laptop.\n\nSmoking: for this week just log every cigarette and delay each by 10 minutes; move lighters/cigs out of easy reach; consider NRT. Pick a quit plan after the reset.\n\nUse simple rules, not motivation:\n- Two‑minute rule: start everything for 2 minutes. Often you’ll keep going.\n- Implementation intentions: “If it’s 6pm and I’m hungry, then I eat my default meal.” “If I feel like ordering, then I wait 10 minutes and drink water.”\n- Never miss twice. If you slip, reset at the next decision.\n\nTrack with a paper calendar or notes app. Aim for 5/7 days on the rules. Post your savings and streak next Sunday.

        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough patch, but it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Getting back on track with discipline can be challenging, but it's definitely doable. Since you're learning to play the guitar, try setting small, achievable goals to rebuild your routine. Start with just 10-15 minutes of practice each day. Consistency is key, and even short sessions can make a big difference over time. Also, try to connect with other guitar learners or join a community online. Sharing progress and challenges with others can be really motivating. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs—what matters is getting back up and keeping at it. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Going from “extreme” to zero is an all‑or‑nothing trap. Switch to minimum viable discipline and rebuild momentum with guitar.\n\nPick a fixed cue (say, after dinner). Set a daily floor of 5 minutes and a ceiling of 30. Keep the guitar on a stand with pick and tuner ready, phone on Do Not Disturb, timer set. Pre-plan a tiny routine so there’s no decision fatigue: tune, a couple minutes of warm‑up, a couple minutes of chord switches or a riff. If a day goes sideways, strum one chord for 60 seconds and call it done—never miss twice.\n\nTrack it with a wall calendar or app and don’t break the chain; record a 20‑second clip every Sunday so you can hear progress. After two weeks at ~80% consistency, either bump the floor by 5 minutes or stack one micro‑habit right after guitar (stretching, quick tidy, 10 pushups). Repeat.\n\nKeep two kinds of days: baseline (just the floor) and bonus (anything above). Keep the promise small, keep showing up, and the intensity will come back on its own."

        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're really trying to find a balance that works for you, and that's a great start. First off, don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to have fluctuations in motivation and energy. If 3 hours feels overwhelming right now, it's totally okay to scale back a bit. Try starting with shorter, focused sessions, like 30-45 minutes, and gradually build up as you get more comfortable. \n\nAlso, consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the work feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each one. It might also help to set specific goals for each session, so you have a clear purpose and can see progress over time.\n\nSince you mentioned that you don't feel the same immediate benefits from work as you do from the gym or eating healthy, try to find ways to make your work more rewarding. Maybe set up a small reward system for yourself or find aspects of the work that you enjoy and focus on those.\n\nLastly, it's worth reflecting on whether this business aligns with your interests and values. If it doesn't, it might be why you're struggling to stay motivated. But if it does, remember that building discipline is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and don't hesitate to adjust your approach as needed. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "3 hours of “pure focus” isn’t small. Most people top out around 3–4 hours of true deep work, and that’s after training. You’re not broken—you’re trying to jump to the end-state.\n\nLower your floor and build up. Pick a minimum you can hit on your worst day (even 30–60 minutes). For the next 2 weeks, use 25/5 pomodoros: aim for 3 per day (about 75 minutes), cap yourself at 5 so you don’t boom-and-bust. Then add one pom per day each week until you’re at 7–8 (around 3–3.5 hours).\n\nMake starting frictionless. The night before, write the first three physical actions for your first block, set a fixed start time, put your phone in another room, and start the timer. Body-doubling (Focusmate, study-with-me streams) can help if starting is the sticking point. Log each finished block, and end by jotting one concrete thing you shipped; give yourself a tiny reward or a walk so there’s immediate feedback like you get from the gym.\n\nIf daily minimums keep tripping you, switch to a weekly target (e.g., 12–16 pomodoros) and distribute them based on energy. Stop while it’s still going well and leave a clear next step for tomorrow.\n\nNot caring about “making bank” is fine. Tie the work to something you do care about: finishing a feature, mastering a skill, helping a customer, earning autonomy. Define one tiny daily deliverable so progress feels real.\n\nDo this for 2–3 weeks, then raise the floor. Consistency first, intensity second."

You can throw everything in before work and come home to a ready meal.

It might be tough at first, but once it becomes a habit, it’ll feel less like a chore.\n\n5. **Incorporate Breaks**: If screen fatigue is a big issue, take short breaks during the day to rest your eyes.

Keep it 20–30 minutes and one pan/pot: sheet-pan chicken + veg, salmon + asparagus, tofu stir-fry with frozen veg, chili in an Instant Pot. Make enough for the next day so Mon and Thu are reheat/assemble. Tue or Fri is a super-fast fallback like eggs + toast + salad or a bean quesadilla.\n\nTo avoid the “stale” feeling, prep components, not full meals. Cook a protein and a carb, store separately, and add fresh elements at serving (bagged salad, cucumber, herbs, avocado) plus a sauce. Different sauces make leftovers feel new: tahini-lemon, chimichurri, salsa, peanut-lime, yogurt-garlic.\n\nUse convenience without guilt: frozen veg, pre-washed greens, microwave rice, canned beans, pre-cut mirepoix. Healthier than takeout and still real food. A rice cooker timer or a slow cooker you load in the morning is huge for weeknights.\n\nBuild a tiny transition ritual for screen-tired eyes: water + 5–10 min walk/stretch, then immediately preheat the oven or start the rice. Five-minute rule: you only have to start; once heat is on, you’ll finish. No couch/phone until a pan is heating.\n\nLower friction: reset the kitchen at night, keep a default grocery list, decide your two recipes before the week starts, and keep knives sharp. Batch a soup/curry/chili every couple weeks and freeze single portions for your most drained days.\n\nTwo focused cooks + a simple start ritual + low-friction setup beats willpower. Give it two weeks and tweak the combos you actually enjoy."

        "comment_gpt5": "It’s hard because you’re going all‑in and relying on motivation. After 2–3 weeks, fatigue and life catch up. The fix: lower the ceiling, raise the floor.\n\nRaise the floor by setting a non‑negotiable “do something” minimum every morning. Ten minutes counts. If you’re dragging, do the warm‑up only and you’re allowed to leave. Keep a prewritten at‑home backup ready (e.g., 3 rounds: 10 squats, 10 push‑ups, 30s plank) so the habit never breaks.\n\nLower the ceiling by capping sessions at 30–45 minutes and stopping with 1–3 reps in the tank (RPE ~6–7). Run a simple plan like 3 full‑body mornings and 2 easy Zone 2 walks. Every 4th week, deload at half volume. That prevents the week‑3 crash.\n\nMake mornings automatic: consistent bedtime, clothes/water set out, alarm across the room, no phone until after your first set. If the gym is a barrier, do the backup at home and go tomorrow.\n\nTrack and recover fast: put an X on a wall calendar for each day you hit the minimum. Aim to never miss twice. Give yourself two “skip tokens” a month so one off day doesn’t become a spiral.\n\nAdd light accountability: book a class, meet a friend, or only allow a favorite podcast during workouts.\n\nStick with this for 8–12 weeks.

Hydrate.\n\nCreate a post‑lunch ritual that leaves no room for bed. As soon as you finish eating: 10–20 minutes of brisk walking and daylight, water, brush your teeth, then sit down and do the easiest 5‑minute task to get rolling.

Reading becomes wind‑down; writing/courses/business go to the parking lot for the next season.\n\nTemplate your evenings so 7 pm has zero decisions. After the dog, do a 60–90 min block on the Primary, short break, then 20–30 min on the Secondary, then wind down. Use timers and shut down by 10:30 so you’re in bed by 11. Pre‑assign days if that’s easier: Mon/Wed/Fri for the Primary, Tue/Thu for the Secondary, Saturday morning for a 2‑hour deep block, Sunday to plan the week. Push micro‑sessions into the day to ease evenings: French flashcards at lunch, 10–15 min instrument scales between meetings.\n\nGive yourself floors and ceilings. Floor = the tiny non‑negotiable even on tired days (e.g., 10 min French, 10 min instrument). Ceiling = stop when the timebox ends, even if you’re in the zone. Use the two‑day rule: never miss your floor two days in a row. Pre‑schedule 1–2 true rest/TV nights so recovery is intentional, not a default. On work‑heavy days, hit your floors and call it a win.\n\nAbout starting a company: it won’t give you more free time at first. Treat it as its own season, or give it one 90‑minute “validation” block weekly to talk to potential customers and test ideas. If traction appears, make it the next season’s Primary.\n\nIf you want a simple start tonight: choose your Primary and Secondary, make the parking‑lot list, block 7:30–9:30 on your calendar, set your floors, and put the remote somewhere you only grab after the first block.

Consistency is key, so try to stick to the same sleep schedule even on weekends. \n\nCreating a relaxing bedtime routine can also help signal to your body that it's time to wind down.

Go to bed when sleepy; the early wake will build sleep pressure and your bedtime will naturally creep earlier. Protect 7–8 hours. If you need a nap, keep it 10–20 minutes and before 2 p.m.\n\nMake the first 5 minutes idiot‑proof. Put the alarm across the room, kill snooze, and prep the night before. When it rings: stand up, lights on, drink water, open blinds, start the kettle, and step outside. Get 10–15 minutes of bright light ASAP; if it’s dark, use a sunrise alarm or 10k‑lux light box. Do 3–5 minutes of movement (pushups/squats/walk). Don’t negotiate with yourself until after that sequence. If you struggle, use an alarm that makes you scan a barcode in the kitchen.\n\nEvenings make or break mornings. Cut caffeine after noon. Dim screens/lights the last 2 hours, use night mode, finish food ~3 hours before bed, take a warm shower, then read. Keep the room cool, dark, and boring. Optional: very small melatonin (0.3–1 mg) a few hours before the new bedtime can help some people shift earlier.\n\nGive yourself a reason to get up beyond “be productive.” Pair 6 a.m. with a small reward you enjoy—great coffee, a playlist, a short walk, or 10 minutes of reading. Expect each step to feel rough for 3–7 days; it gets easier. If 6 a.m. still wrecks you after a few weeks, hold 7 a.m. consistently—consistency beats ambition."

The main tip to wake up early is to sleep early and always the same time, including weekends, in a few days you'll naturally wake up the same hour everyday, the problem is that usually when our system is understanding our new routine we screw up during the weekend.   \nTalking about the routine after work, you have to optimize your activities in a way that you lose time as little as possible like going to the gym after work, go home straight to shower or shower in the gym; right after, you start to cook and if possible cook more meals, this way you save gas/electricity and saves time the next day; schedule what you have to do earlier in the night or maybe during the cooking so you still have a bit of energy like maybe a class or learning a hobby, and the last 1 or 2 hours you have left you rest, watch something dumb, play something, maybe read and slowly let the sleep routine take over.   \nIn a few days you'll love your new routine and you'll realize the more you do the more can be done. Idk why but this happens a lot, when we are lost and without a routine we tend to think we don't have time. but when we figure it out, we understand that there's always a little windows to stick something new you want to try. Be curious, test it, try new things, improvise but always follow your schedule, I like to organize my week during my sunday, this way I know exactly what have to be done in the following days, including when I'll rest.",

For example, commit to a 10-minute workout or a short walk with your dog right after work. This can help build momentum without feeling overwhelming. As for waking up early, try focusing on your evening routine first. Gradually go to bed earlier and create a relaxing pre-sleep ritual to improve your sleep quality. You might find it easier to wake up earlier once you're well-rested. Also, consider prepping meals or planning your hobby time in advance to make it easier to dive in.

The moment you get home, no couch—leash the dog and do a 10–15 min loop. That’s your anchor. When you get back, do a 20‑minute workout. Keep a “minimum” for low‑energy days: 5 minutes of squats/push‑ups/planks or a short jog. Start a timer and go; consistency beats intensity.\n\nCook on autopilot. Decide two easy dinners for the week, shop once, and batch a protein or grain so dinner becomes 10–15 minutes of assembly. Hobby time comes after eating: 20–30 minutes, one hobby for the next 4 weeks, gear laid out beforehand.\n\nUse if‑then rules and reminders: If it’s 6:15, leash on. If I’ve walked, workout starts. If I’m wiped, I do the minimum and still count it. Prep your environment—gym bag packed, shoes and leash by the door, phone charging away from the couch. Track a streak and don’t miss twice.\n\nIf you still want mornings later, shift gradually: move wake time by 15 minutes every few days, keep wake time consistent daily, get bright light ASAP, cut caffeine mid‑afternoon, put the alarm across the room.\n\nSample evening: 6:15 walk, 6:35 workout, 7:05 shower, 7:20 cook/eat, 7:50 hobby, 8:20 wind down.

This helps overcome the initial resistance and makes it easier to build momentum. For example, if you want to start reading daily, just commit to reading one page. Often, you'll find that once you start, you'll want to keep going. Also, try to attach the new habit to an existing one. If you already have a morning coffee routine, use that time to do a quick meditation or plan your day. Consistency is key, so even small steps count. Good luck!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Flow is a side effect of starting, not something you wait to feel. The “trick” is a consistent start ritual + tiny first step + timer + low friction.\n\nPick one habit and set an exact trigger: after coffee at 7:30am at the kitchen table, open the doc. Pre-stage everything the night before. Put your phone in another room and block distracting sites. Set a 10–20 minute timer and aim for a stupid‑small win (write 50 words, read 1 page, do 1 set). Define “done” for that block before you start. When the timer ends, stop while it’s going well and leave a breadcrumb for tomorrow (next subheading, next problem queued). That makes starting easier the next day.\n\nFor daily consistency: anchor to an existing routine, keep a minimum you can hit even on bad days, track it somewhere visible, and use “never miss twice.” If you miss, resume at the next planned time—don’t try to “make up” with a marathon session. Cap maximum effort early on to avoid burnout, then increase slowly.\n\nIf you want more flow, adjust difficulty so it’s slightly challenging with clear goals and quick feedback. Too easy? Raise the target. Too hard? Break it into 5‑minute chunks.\n\nExample script: 7:30pm after dinner, phone in drawer, desk prepped, start the same playlist, open the file, write one ugly paragraph. Do that for 14 days. Flow shows up once the ritual is automatic."

        "comment_gpt4o": "Balancing work, studies, and sleep can definitely be a challenge, but with a few adjustments, you can make it more manageable. First, try to establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve your sleep quality. Also, consider incorporating short power naps (10-20 minutes) during your breaks if possible, as they can help boost your energy levels without affecting your nighttime sleep. \n\nFor your work and study sessions, use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain your focus and prevent burnout. Lastly, pay attention to your diet and hydration; sometimes, sleepiness can be linked to what you eat or drink. Try to have balanced meals and stay hydrated throughout the day. Small changes can make a big difference, so experiment with what works best for you!",
        "comment_gpt5": "WFH plus 10–11 hour days will wipe you out unless you set guardrails. Start by fixing the sleep window: same wake time every day, 7.5–9 hours in bed, hard shutdown from work 60–90 minutes before bed, dim lights/screens, cool dark room. Get outside light within 20 minutes of waking and move your body for 5–10 minutes; delay caffeine 60–90 minutes after waking, then cap it and cut it after ~2 p.m.\n\nStructure your work into 60–90 minute focus blocks with a 3–5 minute movement break each hour. When the 11 a.m. slump hits, stand, splash cold water, do 20 bodyweight squats or a brisk 5-minute walk instead of scrolling. After lunch, keep the meal protein‑heavy and moderate on carbs/fats, then take a 10–15 minute walk; this alone blunts the afternoon crash for most people. If you’re still dragging, a 10–20 minute power nap before 2–3 p.m. can help—set an alarm and keep it short.\n\nPut study where your brain is freshest. For most people with your hours, that’s pre‑work. Try a 30–60 minute focused study block right after your morning light/movement, before you open work apps. If mornings aren’t possible, do a 25–45 minute session at lunch and another short one right after you shut down work, before dinner or couch. Treat these like meetings: calendar block, phone in another room, website blocker on, timer running. On weekends, do one longer block when you’re fresh to move big items forward.\n\nLittle boosts add up: hydrate early and steadily, add a pinch of salt if you’re low-energy, keep your workspace bright, and alternate sitting/standing. Plan your week on Sunday—sleep first, then work, then two or three realistic study slots—and defend those time blocks.\n\nIf you give this two consistent weeks and you’re still fighting heavy daytime sleepiness, get basic labs and a sleep check (iron, thyroid, apnea). But for most, consistent sleep, light, movement, and smarter meal/caffeine timing make the 11/after‑lunch/9 p.m. crashes manageable. You’ll feel human again, and studies will fit."

Do three fast passes through the whole place: carry a trash bag and collect all trash/recycling, carry a hamper and scoop every piece of clothing/towels, then gather all dishes to the sink/dishwasher. Start one load of laundry and run the dishwasher, and call that Round 1. If you have gas left, wipe obvious surfaces and vacuum the main paths—good enough beats perfect. Tomorrow, repeat another short block focused on one room (kitchen or bathroom) and keep chipping away until you’re at “mostly clear surfaces.”\n\nFor maintenance, anchor tiny non-negotiables. At night, do a 10-minute reset: clear the sink, run the dishwasher, put clothes in the hamper, restore floors to “no objects.” In the morning, unload the dishwasher while coffee brews and make the bed. If the hamper is 2/3 full, do one load from start to put-away that day. Each week, schedule two 30-minute appointments: bathrooms one day, floors/dust another. Put them in your calendar and set reminders like you would for class or a hike.\n\nReduce friction so tidy is the default. Put a hamper where clothes come off, hooks by the door, a donate box near the exit, and a small cleaning caddy in each bathroom/kitchen so you can wipe as you go. Use micro-rules: never leave a room empty-handed, if it takes under two minutes do it now, “touch it once” by putting things away—not down, and no dishes left overnight. When cleaning a room, work clockwise, top to bottom, clean to dirty, and do floors last to avoid rework.\n\nUse timers, music, and a simple habit tracker. Aim for streaks of the nightly 10-minute reset; if you miss a day, don’t miss twice. If this has been overwhelming for years, a quick chat with a doctor about executive function can add tools, but you can build this system regardless.\n\nStart today with the trash/hamper/dishes loop and set a nightly 10-minute alarm.

Make three versions of your workout: A (30–45 min full session), B (15 min condensed), C (5 min minimum). All three count. During exam weeks, do C every day; on normal weeks, aim for A or B.\n\nExample C: 20 air squats, 10 push-ups or incline, 1-minute plank, 1-minute stretch, 1 minute of brisk steps/jumping jacks. Done in 5 minutes. You can also sprinkle micro-sets between study blocks.\n\nAnchor it to a cue so it survives fatigue: “As soon as I get home, before shower, I do C,” or “While coffee brews in the morning, I do C.” If you’re too tired for A/B, you still do C. Rule: never miss twice—if yesterday was a zero, today is at least C.\n\nReduce friction: mat out, clothes ready, timer presets, resistance band in your bag for hospital days. Start the timer first and let it pull you in.\n\nTrack one checkbox per day for “did A/B/C.” Don’t chase perfect streaks; chase continuity through messy weeks. Keeping the floor keeps your identity and momentum, so after exams you ramp back up in days, not weeks."

Here’s a simple approach to help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Start by setting small, achievable goals for each study session. For example, aim to focus for just 10-15 minutes at a time, then take a short break. Gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable.\n\n2. **Create a Routine**: Try to establish a consistent study routine. Having a set time and place for studying can help train your brain to get into \"focus mode.\"\n\n3. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distracts you and try to minimize those. This could mean studying in a quiet place, using apps to block distracting websites, or keeping your phone out of reach.\n\n4. **Use Your Short-Sightedness as a Tool**: Since you mentioned your vision, maybe use it to your advantage. Sit closer to the board or screen if possible, and use it as a reason to focus more intently on what's in front of you.\n\n5. **Reward Yourself**: Give yourself a small reward after completing a study session. This could be a snack, a short walk, or a few minutes of a favorite activity.\n\nRemember, building discipline takes time, so be patient with yourself. Good luck!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You already proved a system that works: hear → jot a keyword → Google later. Bring it back, but make it tiny and hard to skip.\n\nMake focusing the easy path: sit in the front or ask to move closer, update your glasses/contacts if you can, print/zoom slides, phone in bag on Do Not Disturb. Before class, open your notebook and write “One term + one sentence.” Your only job each topic is to capture one key term and one sentence in your own words. When you catch yourself daydreaming, park it: write the thought on a “later” line, look up, and ask, “What’s the point right now?”\n\nAfter class, set a 5–10 minute timer for a quick search sprint on the starred terms, then stop. Track it with a simple chain: every class you do the one-sentence + sprint, mark an X. If you miss, just start again next class—no catch-up. Use the 10‑minute rule at the start: promise yourself to focus for 10 minutes; if you still want to zone out after, you can. Also handle the basics (sleep, water, small snack).\n\nDo this for one week. Momentum beats “motivation,” and your minimum baseline will carry you."

        "comment_gpt5": "One year is plenty. Treat it like training: build consistency first, then intensity. Commit to 5 study days/week. Start with one 25–30 minute block per day for two weeks, then add a second block. By month 2–3, aim for 60–90 minutes/day at a comfortable, repeatable pace.\n\nPick a practice subject close to what you’ll study (or a general skill like math, writing, or basic stats). Use a MOOC (Coursera/edX/Khan Academy) or a textbook and treat it like a class. Study actively: read/watch, then close the material and write what you remember, explain it in your own words, and do practice problems. Make a few flashcards each session and review them with spaced repetition (Anki works well).\n\nDo a weekly review every Sunday. Plan your sessions on a calendar, prep materials the night before, and track completed blocks with a simple tally so you see momentum. Create a dedicated study spot, leave your phone in another room, and use a timer so you don’t rely on willpower.\n\nIf your program is writing-heavy, write one 300–500 word piece each week and get light feedback. If it’s math/science-heavy, do daily problem sets and build from foundations. Use a simple note system (Cornell/outline) and keep everything organized in OneNote/Google Drive; learn basic citation/reading tools like Zotero if you’ll read papers.\n\nAvoid burnout by ramping slowly, keeping one full day off each week, scheduling a lighter “deload” week every 6–8 weeks, and protecting sleep and movement.\n\nStarter week: choose a course, do five 25-minute sessions, make 30 flashcards total, write one short summary, and do a 30-minute Sunday review. Repeat and add volume gradually. You’ll hit the ground running."

For example, \"I want to learn a new skill, like coding, and complete an online course in three months.\" This gives you a clear target to aim for.\n\n2. **Break It Down**: Big goals can be overwhelming, so break them into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Discipline often comes from routine. Set aside specific times each day or week dedicated to working on your goals. Consistency is key.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Share your goals with a friend or join a community with similar interests. Having someone to check in with can keep you motivated and accountable.\n\n5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. What's working? What's not? Be open to adjusting your approach if needed.\n\n6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Don't wait until you've achieved the big goal to celebrate. Acknowledge and reward yourself for the small victories along the way.\n\nRemember, growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, so embrace the discomfort as a sign that you're moving in the right direction.

        "comment_gpt5": "Treat growth like strength training: a program, reps, and progressive overload. Motivation fades; schedule and environment do the work.\n\nRun 6-week sprints. Pick one area. Define one daily process metric (e.g., 45 minutes of focused practice, one problem solved). Set a tiny minimum (10 minutes) so bad days still count. Put it on your calendar at the same time. Track a simple yes/no. Each week, nudge difficulty 10–20% and after the sprint, take a light week or switch focus.\n\nGet out of your comfort zone with a daily discomfort rep: one action that’s a 3–4/10 on the discomfort scale. Examples: send one outreach message, share a draft, ask a question in a meeting, try a new workout. The win is doing the rep, not the result.\n\nBeat procrastination with starts, not finishes. Use the 10-minute rule, timebox with a timer, and “finish ugly” to dodge perfectionism. Make if–then plans for common obstacles and change your environment: phone in another room, doc open the night before, first task written on a sticky note.\n\nDo a 15-minute weekly review: what reps did I do, what did I learn, what’s the next edge to push. Adjust the plan, not the goal. This prevents drift back to autopilot.\n\nKeep your base steady: sleep, light, movement, real food, water. Low energy often looks like apathy.\n\nToday: choose one area, define your daily minimum, schedule tomorrow’s block, and set up the first five minutes. Then do one discomfort rep. Start the chain."

I haven't done a single thing for the first semester of college and now my second semester is coming up in a few days, and now one of my scholarship funding sources are asking for my grades. WHAT DO I DO?!\n\nYou might be wondering how this happened...well...\n\nI have a severe hentai addiction. I've gotten into this terrible procrastination routine where I pleasure myself, then play a video game, then eat, then sleep, pleasure myself some more, then repeat that cycle the next day. My question is, how do I stop? I've tried P0rn blockers, but because how easy it was to turn off the blocker to watch my \"content\", I built a habit of disabling the blocker before going onto my computer, rendering it worthless.\n\nAnother problem is whenever I work myself up to not watching the content, my day filled up with other distractions like video games.\n\nEven when I had a day with absolutely zero distractions, no games, no h3ntai, and the perfect working environment, I had this odd habit to walk out of my room and around the kitchen, maybe grab a snack, or I would just go to sleep. I don't understand why I do this. For the work environment, I do use a basic kitchen chair, which I'm not sure if that has something to do with it as they're not designed to sit at a computer desk for hours.\n\nNow back to my college stuff. I can slowly work on self-improving and my procrastination later (ik that sounds counterintuitive), but seriously, I don't know what to say to my dad. I can't just say \"I didn't do a single one of my assignments and I basically scrapped my entire first semester\", and I most certainly can't say that to one of my primary sources of scholarships. What tf do I do? On top of that, I have severe social anxiety. Many of the comments are gonna say \"just do it\", but it doesn't work like that.\n\nFor stopping my procrastination, I'm getting a little into Atomic Habits, but I've even found myself procrastinating in my anti-procrastination.

It might be tough, but consider having a candid conversation with your dad and the scholarship committee. Explain that you struggled with the transition and are actively working on improving. They might appreciate your honesty and determination to do better.\n\nRegarding your habits, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. Since blockers haven't worked, try changing your environment. If possible, study in a library or a café where distractions are minimized. Also, set small, achievable goals for each day. Instead of thinking about the entire semester, focus on completing one assignment or studying for one hour. Celebrate these small wins to build momentum.\n\nFor the social anxiety, consider reaching out to your college's counseling services.

        "comment_gpt5": "First, damage control. You can’t hide grades, so get in front of it. Email your academic advisor, financial aid, and the scholarship contact today. Keep it short: you didn’t meet standards last term, you’re taking concrete steps to fix it, and you’re asking about SAP/probation, appeal options, and whether a reduced load or official leave is smarter for spring. Then tell your dad the truth, but bring a plan: “I blew my first semester. I own it. Here’s exactly what I’m doing next.”\n\nAbout taking the second semester: if you cannot commit right now to a basic routine for two weeks (no porn/games, two short study blocks daily, consistent sleep), take an official leave instead of rolling the dice and digging the hole deeper. If you can stick to that routine immediately, go back on a light load. Make the call with your advisor and financial aid so you don’t lose standing or aid unnecessarily.\n\nOn the porn/gaming loop, make access genuinely hard. Move the computer out of your bedroom. Uninstall all games and delete accounts if you can. Put a router-level DNS filter like CleanBrowsing/OpenDNS and have someone else set the password. On your devices, use Screen Time/Family Link with a recovery passcode you don’t know. Create a non-admin account on your computer so you can’t install/disable things. If you need a device for school, use a cheap Chromebook with only school apps. Add accountability: daily check-ins with a friend/mentor/counselor, or a support group for compulsive sexual behavior. If you can, see a therapist who treats this; it accelerates change.\n\nFor the “I keep getting up or falling asleep” problem, stop working in your room. Go to the library or a public table. Start comically small: set a 5‑minute timer and open the assignment. When the timer ends, take a 2‑minute break and do another 5–15. Pomodoro (25/5) works, but start smaller if 25 feels heavy. Have a start ritual: water, headphones, open the doc, write one sentence. When an urge hits, leave the room and do a 10‑minute walk or 20 bodyweight reps, then come back; urges pass if you don’t feed them.\n\nLock in basics because they lower cravings and anxiety: wake at the same time, morning sunlight for 10 minutes, 30 minutes of walking or lifting daily, protein with each meal, and a consistent bedtime. Keep your phone out of the bedroom at night.\n\nWhat to say to scholarship/dad: “I didn’t meet academic progress last term due to personal issues I’m now addressing. I’m implementing a structured plan (counseling, accountability, reduced distractions, set study blocks). I’m requesting probation/appeal information and guidance on reduced load or a leave.” To your dad: same message plus your daily schedule and what you want him to hold you accountable to.\n\nNext 48 hours: send the emails, book counseling, move the computer, wipe games, set the locks with an outside passcode, and do two short study blocks at the library. Apply for a part-time job if you take a leave; structure beats willpower.\n\nYou’re 18. This is fixable. Don’t wait to feel ready—do the next clear step today."

Your body (and the body part of your mind, some call it the subconscious) has an idea about a certain amount of free undisciplined time they are owed every day. Once you get your work hours in, try and plan your undisciplined time ahead and stick to it. For eg. I cook a great meal and eat it. That seems to calm things down and it is a win in terms of health and getting my mind ready for the next day. Or you can watch a good movie. Select the movie ahead of time and don't sit in front of Netflix and hit the remote - Netflix algorithms are tuned to push you into long-running and addictive TV series, next thing you know you will be sitting there and it is past 3 am. Workouts are a great way to relax, but the body-mind knows that this is a sort of discipline and often doesn't get the same amount of relaxation points as say a movie or a dinner.

In it, they do explain the effects of social media scrolling and how it’s akin to slot machines. \n\nHere’s a partial explanation by Tristan Harris, an ex-employee for Google who worked as a design ethicist, and is one of the drivers of the documentary:\n\n\n“Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” he says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.” What slot machines and social media share are variable rewards.\n\nThis feeds into the ‘pull to refresh’ function. Every time we pull down to refresh our timeline—whether that’s on Facebook, Twitter or even by email—we don’t know what we’ll discover. That could be a new email from work, lots of surprising ‘likes’ or even disappointment should there be nothing fresh to excite us. The downward-pull action, created by designer Loren Brichter, has been emulated across many different apps, and its ubiquity has become intuitive for its users. Being drawn into what’s called ‘ludic loops’—where a user is unsure whether they’ll receive feedback (or in the case of a slot machine, cash rewards) following anticipation—is what keeps us hooked. Or, as Harris says: pulling the lever.”\n\nLink: https://www.we-heart.com/2019/09/04/social-media-and-the-slot-machine/\n\nThere’s a wide range of sources online that compare the striking physiological similarities between the rush you feel from slot machines and the rush you feel from scrolling and refreshing your social media. According to the documentary, it was built this way on purpose. \n\nAs always take these things with a grain is salt, however the documentary is definitely interesting!",

The problem is, it can become a cycle that disrupts your sleep and productivity. \n\nTo break this habit, try setting a specific time limit for social media use in the evening, maybe 30 minutes, and stick to it. Use apps that can help you enforce these limits. Also, consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine that doesn't involve screens—like reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. \n\nRemember, it's about finding balance. You don't have to cut out social media entirely, but being mindful of how and when you use it can make a big difference. Good luck!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Classic revenge bedtime procrastination plus a “second wind.” After 16 hours your brain craves easy reward and control, and bright, novel feeds plus blue light crank you back up. Don’t fight that with willpower—outdesign it.\n\nSet a hard stop and a shutdown ritual on a timer. Write tomorrow’s top 3, tidy your desk, dim lights, then put the phone to sleep outside the bedroom. Use Screen Time/Downtime or Freedom/Opal/One Sec/Lock Me Out to kill socials 9:30pm–7am, and give the passcode to someone else. Router schedules work too. Keep a paper book or Kindle by the bed so the default is reading, not tapping. You don’t need a full dopamine fast; consistent boundaries beat abstinence long‑term.\n\nPlan a small, guilt‑free leisure block earlier in the evening. Twenty minutes of intentional scrolling or one episode at 8pm scratches the itch so you don’t “steal time” at 1am. After that: screen curfew.\n\nAdd a quick physiological downshift: hot shower, light stretch, tea, 4‑7‑8 breathing, low lights. Cut caffeine after lunch and get morning daylight to help the circadian side.\n\nHave a rescue move for when you catch yourself spiraling: stand up, say “Tomorrow,” plug the phone in the kitchen, 10 slow breaths, lights off, bed. Run this boringly for two weeks, then adjust.\n\nBig picture: cap the 16‑hour grinds when possible. Productive days don’t count if they erase tomorrow. Protect the next day with rules and environment, not heroics."

I live at home, work part time (work reduced my hours), am taking one class at a local college (all I can pay for), and am applying for more part time work at other places. I live in Cleveland, so the rent is super high but still not cheap. I pay my mom 500 a month but that is it. \n\nMy mom doesn’t work herself but does get alimony from her ex, my father (they split up 10 years ago, and we are pretty estranged), and her parents (my grandparents, who I am also not close to because they are devout Jehovah witnesses) pay for her/our rent. The $500 I pay actually covers rent for this big store front-turned-storage-unit with a bunch of stuff from our old house that my mom intends to sell but it’s been many many years (10+).\n\nI also obviously pay for any personal things like my clothes/money to go out. I also paid my tuition for one class at a local college. she still pays for my groceries and phone. I’m so embarrassed. \n\nShe doesn’t want me to move out because she says I’m incapable of functioning and I’m trying to prove both of us wrong. I do housework, try to clean up after both of us, help her whenever I can, but I’m still basically a child and I hate myself for being so behind. \n\nI’m grateful, don’t get me wrong, but I’m incredibly ashamed of what it says about me that I am where I am in life.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?

Work on building healthy boundaries with your family, you might be taking on inherited generational trauma.

It's full-time, pays decent, and if you want to continue taking 1-3 evening college courses to work toward something, you can.\n\nYou can probably find a roommate for the same $500 you pay your mom.\n\nShe sounds toxic by telling you that you can't function without her - you can. If you are interested in any construction careers from concrete to carpentry to electrical, shoot me a PM and I can try to give advice if you're interested. I think beyond warehouse work, it's one of the fastest ways to a decent paying career with upward wage growth (apprenticeships, etc). Even drywall work is typically full-time work and good pay. The other fast track to decent income is sales work, but I think it's harder to find the right opportunity, and not everyone is suited for sales work.\n\nConstruction gets you pretty disciplined, you have to show up on the jobsites early, most work starts at 7am, sometimes 6am, you finish at a respectable time, usually 3:30pm or sometimes you work later, you work a physical job in all weather conditions, you learn skills, work with your hands, and it helps self-confidence in almost everyone who starts.",
        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone's journey is different, and it's great that you're actively seeking ways to improve your situation. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. **Job Situation**: Since your hours were reduced, it's smart that you're looking for additional part-time work. Keep applying and consider jobs that might offer more hours or better pay. Even if they're not in your ideal field, they can help you save up and gain more independence.\n\n2. **Education**: If you can manage it financially and time-wise, continuing with your class is a good idea. Education can open doors, but it doesn't have to be a full-time commitment right now. Maybe look into online courses or certifications that are affordable and can boost your skills.\n\n3. **Budgeting**: Try to track your expenses and see if there are areas where you can save more. Every little bit helps when you're working towards moving out.\n\n4. **Communication with Your Mom**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your mom about your goals and how she can support you in becoming more independent. Maybe there's a way to gradually take on more responsibilities that can help prove your capability.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion**: Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be where you are. Focus on small, consistent steps towards your goals, and celebrate the progress you make along the way.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "You’re not broken—you just need a clear plan and a near-term priority. Make independence the first milestone: stable full‑time income, basic bills in your name, savings, and a move‑out date. The degree can follow on a funded path.\n\nIf your one class slows job search or scheduling, pause it for one term. Land full‑time work with benefits first, then keep taking classes part‑time using tuition assistance. “Shitty” jobs aren’t stupid; they’re stepping stones.\n\nIn Cleveland, apply hard to Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, and MetroHealth (patient transport, environmental services, dietary, unit secretary, call center)—no degree needed and strong tuition benefits. Also look at UPS/USPS/FedEx, Costco/Aldi/Trader Joe’s, city/county roles, Progressive, Sherwin‑Williams. Set a quota (e.g., 10–15 quality applications daily) and treat it like a job until you’re getting interviews.\n\nUse OhioMeansJobs and Tri‑C for short programs that jump pay fast (STNA, phlebotomy, EKG, help desk, CDL). At 26 you’re independent for FAFSA; talk to Tri‑C’s aid office and submit FAFSA—Pell/state grants may cover community college so you’re not paying out of pocket.\n\nBuild a simple budget and a move‑out fund. Open a separate savings account and auto‑transfer each payday. Target first month’s rent + deposit + starter emergency fund ($2–4k).\n\nStart taking over your own bills now (phone, groceries) to build the muscle. Revisit the $500: if it’s really for long‑term storage that isn’t yours, set a 60‑day plan to help clear/sell/donate; after that, redirect that money to savings or true room‑and‑board.\n\nPick a realistic move‑out deadline (6–9 months). Aim for a room in a shared place first—it’s cheaper and gets you independent sooner. Upgrade later.\n\nRun a tight daily routine: fixed wake/sleep, 2 focused hours of applications/networking, your shift, 30 minutes exercise, 30 minutes chores/meal prep, and a weekly review of apps/interviews/savings. Track it on paper so you can see progress.\n\nDon’t argue with “you’re incapable.” Show receipts: bills paid, schedule kept, savings growing. Keep conversations with your mom factual—what you’ll pay, what date you’ll move, what help you can offer with the storage.\n\nDo this for 12 weeks and your situation will look very different. Independence first; degree on a paid path. You’ve got effort—now give it structure and a clock."

Understanding the context and experiences of others can help break down stereotypes.\n\n2. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: When you catch yourself having a racist thought, pause and question it. Ask yourself why you think that way and if it's based on facts or assumptions. Over time, this can help rewire your thinking.\n\n3. **Diversify Your Feed**: Follow people from different backgrounds on social media. Exposure to diverse perspectives can help you see the world through different lenses and reduce biases.\n\n4. **Practice Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the shoes of those you judge. Consider their experiences and challenges. This can foster a more compassionate outlook.\n\n5. **Seek Conversations**: Engage in discussions with people from different backgrounds.

        "comment_gpt5": "Props for wanting to change. Treat this like any other habit: notice the cue, interrupt the routine, install a new one. Make a simple if-then: “If I catch myself generalizing by race, then I pause, label it ‘stereotype,’ take one breath, and replace it with ‘individual, not group; I don’t know their story,’ then describe only the behavior.” That’s your rep.\n\nTrack reps, not perfection. Use a clicker app or pocket coins and tally every catch. Do a 2‑minute nightly log: trigger, old thought, replacement. Aim to increase your interception rate each week. The goal is shorter lag between thought and correction.\n\nControl your inputs. Unfollow outrage/“gotcha” accounts and avoid comment sections. Set a daily time cap for short-form feeds. When a clip triggers you, run a 10‑second check: Is this representative or just salient? Would I think the same if it were “my” group? What else could explain this? Then move on.\n\nBuild the opposite habit: individuation. Daily 5‑minute reps—read a brief story, interview, or bio that humanizes someone from a group you stereotype, or after seeing a person, list three specific, non-group traits you noticed. Weekly, get real contact in mixed settings (class, sport, volunteer shift); keep it about the shared activity, not debate.\n\nAdd a language rule for 30 days: ban “they always/of course they” in your self-talk. Replace with “some individuals” or stay silent.\n\nExpect slip-ups; success is catching and correcting faster. If it feels sticky or intrusive, a CBT-oriented therapist can help you speed this up.

      "body": "I spent so many years of my life doing the bare minimum when it came to developing my life that I’m almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself. I feel like I’m still a lazy 16-year-old trapped in a 29-year-old body, and that’s the equivalent of how my intelligence feels sometimes, even though I’m for sure smarter than that. On top of that, I’ve relied on those around me to fill in the gaps in my finances as I worked entry-level jobs at minimum wage so I can masquerade as working hard for my future just to have zero control of my finances because I had terrible spending habits (I say had because I’m actively working on myself every day and over time have been making big progress). I suffer from depression because of the weight in which I judge myself. The only really great thing going for me right now is that I lost \\~100lbs since last summer, and I barely want to give myself credit for that because although it was hard work, I spent 3-4 days at a time just not eating and only consuming White Claws to keep me at baseline while I hung around the house and eventually hopped on the computer to spend the night on Call of Duty (that wasn’t that often, just a few week time frame, I did have a more healthy side to my diet than that). I enjoyed the dynamic of competition in video games because I didn’t have to physically compete (adding to my ever-so-growing laziness), I made deep connections with voices and personalities and not actual people in my real life that I can hang out with. I fell in love with computer-generated worlds and stories and wanted to be there more than in real life. I felt more satisfaction in achieving success in GTA than I did putting in the effort at any job because the paycheck was still going to be the same regardless. I feel like that's caused me to observe the world in a way where it's here for everybody else and that sometimes I just don't belong. Of course, though, my childhood had a huge playing role in why I am where I am today. I’m never sure of my next move, I’m usually unsure of my decisions and thoughts more often than being certain of the things I want and am after. My friends are all doing really well and seem to be about 10 years ahead of me in life. I don’t know how to structure my day, so in return, I don’t know if what I’m doing is enough or if I’m cutting myself short. I feel like all of my values are so out of whack and I want to take control of them. Unfortunately with gaming for so long and not having to physically apply myself, my brain became lazier over time, which caused me to just observe and not contribute (more so when I’d always watch movies and youtube through the years). I’m always way too critical of myself, I feel like I’m so far behind in life and it’s really uncomfortable and hard to come to grips with. It makes it uneasy for me to relax because I am confused and don’t know what career path to take, I feel that I need to have a genuine uninterrupted interest in something to be happy enough to truly pursue it with absolute drive. But I also grew up around siblings that are older than me and had a successful business that exposed me to a lifestyle of elevated living and dining with a careless mentality because I was in love with the life I had when I was with them, but I only saw the fun part of it and even though I spent a lot of time in the office spaces, I never really captured the perspective and idea that this lifestyle came from hard work and effort, and I didn’t witness the beginning years of the business and before when they were starting up because I was too young. Also, everybody moved away, my sister is in one southern state, one brother is in a western state, and my other brother is in the same state but we don’t really talk much anymore because of his own issues, unfortunately. Because I lived around enabling environments my whole life, it caused me to slip through the cracks and not get ahead like I was supposed to. I lived with my mother and sister for 19 years of my life. My mother was in a near-fatal car crash in her teens and suffered life-changing disabilities which caused her to become heavily addicted to pain medication and hard liquor. She couldn’t be there for me as much as she wanted because she gained a lot of weight over the years because of her addictions, she was in pain all the time and didn’t have the capacity to really be on my ass with school work and personal development like other parents did with their kids. And my sister wasn’t the most motivated person either, so that’s what I was surrounded by. My father was more of the one to push me academically, but my parents were separated and I only saw my father on the weekends. I just guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like I have all the right resources, but my scatter-brains prevent me from seeing a clear, direct path on how to take initiative. My memory recall is hit or miss, and when I see a new perspective that helps me better understand things, I lose it the next morning when I wake up, which can result in me feeling depressed because I can’t continue to operate in that same perspective. I’m not sure, but I think that causes me to not take the initiative with anything as a result, maybe I disguise that as being lazy. Also, my apologies for being all over the place, I guess since I was lazy with education, I never really learned how to structure my thoughts properly to formulate a coherent body of text. One last thing, I realize people tell me I’m way too in my head, which I agree about, but I can’t help it because my focus is so loose, my mind always takes over. How can I be more present, be a more active listener, and become much more aware of my surroundings?",

It sounds like you're ready to take control of your life, and that's a great first step. Here are a few ideas to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start Small**: It can be overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Pick one or two small habits to work on first. Maybe it's setting a consistent wake-up time or dedicating 30 minutes a day to learning something new.\n\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve in the short term and long term. Write these down and break them into actionable steps. This can help you focus and give you a sense of direction.\n\n3. **Create a Routine**: Structure can be incredibly helpful. Try to establish a daily routine that includes time for work, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\n4. **Limit Gaming Time**: Since gaming has been a big part of your life, try setting specific times for it, so it doesn't take over your day. Use it as a reward after completing tasks.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being present by engaging in activities that require focus, like meditation or even just mindful breathing exercises. This can help you become more aware of your surroundings and improve your focus.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a therapist. Having someone to talk to can provide encouragement and accountability.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small, and keep moving forward. You've got this!",

Now give yourself a simple, boring plan for 90 days and let the results compound.\n\nDo a reset on the big leaks: no alcohol/weed/gaming for 90 days. Uninstall and block (Cold Turkey/Focus), move the console/PC out of the bedroom, delete Discord/YouTube from your phone, and tell one person you trust. Fill the time gap on purpose with exercise and in‑person activities. If cravings are rough, hit SMART Recovery/AA/NA or a therapist—humans beat habits in groups.\n\nRun a “Minimum Viable Day” so you know you did enough: same wake and lights‑out every day; 10 minutes outside in the morning; one protein/veg meal you cook; 30 minutes of sweat; 60 minutes of focused work or learning; 15 minutes cleaning; 10 minutes planning/journaling. Put these as checkboxes on paper. If the day goes sideways, do any two to keep the streak alive.\n\nTo be present and listen better, use tiny rules you can execute anywhere. Before talking, two slow breaths. While they talk, keep your phone face down and your eyes on them. Paraphrase one sentence of what they said and ask one open question (“What was the hardest part?”). Wait two seconds before replying. When your mind spirals, ground yourself with 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.) or box breathing for a minute.\n\nIf you lose helpful perspectives overnight, capture and review. Keep one note called “Today.” Each morning write one sentence: What matters today. Each night add one sentence: What I learned. Read yesterday’s before you start. Do a 20‑minute weekly review on Sunday: look over the week, pick three priorities for next week, schedule them.\n\nCareer: don’t hunt for passion; run 8‑week skill sprints. Pick one path with clear entry options, do 60 minutes a day, build a tiny proof, talk to three people in that field, then decide to continue or pivot. Examples: IT support (Google IT cert + home lab), bookkeeping (Excel + mock books), sales (commission retail + cold‑call reps), a trade (apply as an apprentice). After one sprint, you’ll have either momentum or clarity.\n\nMoney: separate accounts. Direct deposit bill money into a “Bills” account you don’t touch, use a “Spending” account with a weekly cap, and stash $1k as a starter emergency fund. Track every dollar for 30 days with a notes app or YNAB/EveryDollar. Automate what you can.\n\nSocial and awareness: join one thing that meets in person twice a week for eight weeks (gym class, BJJ, run club, Toastmasters, volunteering, church/12‑step/Meetup). Go even when you don’t feel like it. Say hi to three people each time. Consistent attendance beats charm.\n\nTools that help: Pomodoro 25/5 for focus, a bedtime alarm, site blockers, and a big wall calendar to mark streaks. Use the Rule of 3 each day: one task for health, one for money/work, one for relationships.\n\nStart small today: throw out the booze/weed, uninstall the games, write your checklist, and take a 10‑minute walk. Tomorrow, wake at the same time, do your first 25‑minute focused block on a skill, and cook that one meal. If depression is heavy, see a doctor or therapist; it makes everything harder than it needs to be.\n\nYou don’t need certainty—just a boring plan executed daily. Compare yourself only to yesterday. Do this for 12 weeks and you won’t feel like the same person."

So normally people talk about flight or fight but there’s also freeze, and that’s often how procrastination manifests. When you think of doing something, you avoid it or just get locked up. Your reaction toward something that sucks - is just your “lizard brain” reaction.\n\nOne of the big key pieces of overcoming it is being compassionate toward yourself. When you say I’m an idiot, I’m lazy, I’m scared, I’m a pussy, or any number of self-destructive things it makes the feeling worse because you then feel guilt or shame which makes you even more reluctant to do the task.\n\nSo here’s the tips:\n1. Show yourself compassion and say (either in your head or out loud-it’s up to you) I’m afraid, scared, anxious about this thing, whatever it is.\n2. Think of the positive aspects of your personality - you’re smart, capable, hard working, or whatever it is that you believe is good within you.\n3. Tell yourself it’s sucks but you can do it. Not necessarily that you believe in yourself or philosophically… but rather functionally that you are capable of the task - period. Telling yourself you can do but removing the emotionality of the task helps removes/reduce the emotional emotional aspects that causss anxiety, stress, etc.\n4. Just start. Tell yourself you’ll do it for 5 minutes. Make the goal small, quick, and not necessarily the entire thing you want to do. Putting on a distraction like tv or music can help - but avoid the internet or phone or something that’s likely to suck you in.\n5. When you hit five minutes you might either be like “thank god it’s over” or “I can keep going”. If you say “thank god, it’s over…” try to push through again by going back to the original steps. Show yourself self-compassion, tell yourself your strengths, tell yourself you’re more than capable, and just start again.\n\nEventually it becomes a habit - which is key to it and helps make it less of an obstacle in the future.",

        "comment_gpt4o": "Absolutely, a 37-year-old can change his life! It's great that you're ready to try. Start by focusing on small, manageable steps. With $1.25, consider buying ingredients like rice, beans, or oats, which are filling and nutritious. For long-term change, look into local food banks or community resources that might offer support. Building discipline starts with setting small, achievable goals. Try to establish a daily routine, even if it's just waking up at the same time each day or dedicating 10 minutes to a new skill or job search. Remember, change is a gradual process, and every small step counts. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "Yes—37 is not too late. Start with the next 24 hours.\n\nToday: get fed. Call 211 and say you need a meal today; they’ll tell you soup kitchens/pantries open now. Library/community center staff can look it up too. If you must buy something with $1.25, go for calories you can eat without cooking: a pull‑tab can of beans, bananas, or instant oats/ramen plus free hot water from a gas station.\n\nNext 48 hours: get cash flowing. Be at a day‑labor hall (PeopleReady/Labor Finders) when they open; many pay same day. Ask managers at small stores or apartment complexes if they need cleanup/trash‑out help today. Tell five neighbors you’ll do yard/moving/cleaning for cash.\n\nDiscipline plan (keep it stupid simple): every day do three blocks. Income block: 2 hours minimum of apply/ask/work. Health block: 20–30 min walk + basic hygiene. Order block: 10 minutes cleaning your space/paperwork. Before bed, write tomorrow’s top 3 tasks and do them first. Track it on a calendar/notebook—don’t break the chain.\n\nWithin a week: apply for SNAP/EBT and register with local food banks, get or replace ID, set a fixed sleep/wake time, and write down every dollar you spend.\n\nYou don’t have to fix everything at once.

        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! First off, it's great that you're reaching out for advice—acknowledging where you are is a big step. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Break it down**: For your law degree, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. Use a timer and commit to just that short period. Often, starting is the hardest part.\n\n2. **Sleep and energy**: Since sleep is a big issue, consider creating a bedtime routine to help signal your body it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as dimming the lights, reading a book, or doing some light stretching. Also, check in with your doctor about your sleep and energy levels—there might be underlying issues that need addressing.\n\n3. **ADHD management**: Keep working with your healthcare provider on finding the right medication or therapy. In the meantime, try using tools like planners or apps to help manage tasks and deadlines. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help with motivation.\n\n4. **Social anxiety**: Practice makes progress. Try to gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with low-pressure environments. Remember, most people are more focused on themselves than on judging you.\n\n5. **Tidy up**: For your apartment, set a timer for 10 minutes each day to tackle one small area. It’s amazing how much you can accomplish in short bursts, and it can help reduce the overwhelm.\n\n6. **Finances**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor or using budgeting apps to get a handle on your finances. They can help you create a plan to tackle debt and manage expenses.\n\nRemember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the little wins along the way. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "31 isn’t late. You don’t need more motivation—you need a few repeatable levers. Try a 14‑day stabilization sprint aimed at sleep, one daily win at work, minimum viable study, and clearing the biggest home/finance fires.\n\nSleep: pick a non‑negotiable wake time (same 7 days), get 10–15 min sunlight within 30 minutes of waking, cut caffeine after noon. Nudge bedtime earlier by ~15 minutes every 2–3 days. Consider 0.5–1 mg melatonin 4–6 hours before target bed. If you snore, wake unrefreshed, or can’t lose weight despite eating well, ask your doctor about a sleep study and basic labs (thyroid, iron/ferritin, B12, vitamin D) and revisit ADHD meds with them.\n\nWork: each morning write a single deliverable you’ll finish by noon. Do three 25/5 focus cycles with your phone in another room or use Focusmate. At ~3 pm send your manager a short “here’s what I shipped/next/blockers” note. Aim for “good enough,” not perfect.\n\nLaw degree: this week, call your advisor to map the absolute minimum path to graduate in six months and get ADHD accommodations. Then do one 25‑minute study block five days a week focused on past exams/active recall. Keep the streak; expand later if you want.\n\nHome: nightly 10‑minute timer—trash, dishes, laundry, in that order. If it’s really bad, do a one‑time 60–90 minute “trash bag sprint” this weekend. If you can swing it, a one‑off cleaner is a great reset.\n\nFinances: today, set autopay for minimums so nothing goes late. Tomorrow, call collectors and set a small payment plan you can actually keep. Remove saved cards/one‑click buys. Do a 10‑minute “money check” on weekdays to log spending and scan balances.\n\nADHD‑friendly tactics: externalize everything (whiteboard/sticky notes), body‑double (Focusmate/library), time‑block the first hour of the day, and use the 10‑minute rule when frozen—do ten minutes, then decide to continue.\n\nMeetings: jot three points beforehand, speak once in the first five minutes, and ask one clarifying question. Early participation shrinks the anxiety.\n\nMake a tiny visible scoreboard: Wake on time, 20‑min walk, Work block, Study block, 10‑min tidy, Money check. Hit 5/6 most days. If you miss, restart next day—no drama.\n\nIf after two weeks you’re still wiped out, push harder on the medical side with your doctor. You’re six months from closing a huge loop—keep it small, repeatable, and visible. Post an update in two weeks and we can fine‑tune the next step."

Then run your three blocks with short breaks. Example schedule: 8:30 wake, 9:00 Move, 10:00 Learn, 11:00 Create, lunch, then chores/social/free time.

Do a 30‑day “no zero days” streak: even on busy days, 10 minutes counts.\n\nIf you can, add one external anchor: part-time job, volunteering at the library/animal shelter/food bank, a sports league, or a class at a community center.

It's cost me every job and hobby I've ever had and it's cost me the love of my life. \n\nAs soon as anything I do requires discipline to accomplish, the wall goes up and gets taller every day. I've been a game developer for a decade and I've never finished a game. I've been playing musical instruments and singing my entire life but I've never managed to learn sheet music or any scales or arpeggios on anything. Believe me I have tried. The trying never lasts long enough. The shame is overwhelming.\n\nI'm sick of not being good at anything. I'm sick of this abstract baseless fear ruling my life. How the fuck am I supposed to overcome a discipline aversion without discipline?! Has anyone conquered something this deeply rooted? What steps did you take?",
      "comments": {
        "best_comment": "I looked at how my life was going and instead of getting angry or resentful, I got motivated. I self-started motivation to build discipline, since the former will eventually give out and die as time goes on — as you seem to well know. \n\nI set my sights on smaller goals, rather than large ones like writing a book, earning a certification, fixing everything wrong with my house. I started small. I committed to studying every day for at least an hour. I committed to journaling every morning, writing something reflective, no matter how long it was. I committed to completing simple steps of my projects when I had the time. I committed to reading one chapter of a book per day instead of gaming my free time away. \n\nNow, I have the discipline to get up early and journal. I finished a novel and started the second one. My house to-do list is more limited by money than by my discipline and motivation. I’m closing in on a certification, after which I will seek another one.\n\nI struggle with ADHD and a natural laziness. I hate getting up early. I’d much rather play video games than study. The task of writing a novel is monumental and I don’t really want to do it all again (despite wanting to finish my story). I’d rather not work at all. Discipline aversion isn’t unique to you. Some people deal with it, but you can overcome it. Gamify it if you must; I didn’t find it particularly motivating, but I know many do. \n\nYou need to set small goals and remind yourself of them constantly. Accomplishing these small goals will build confidence, which inspires motivation, which is how you build discipline. That’s how I overcame the problem you’re having.",
        "percentile_10_comment": "The shame needs to be addressed. If shame is your motivator, it won't last. If hope is your motivator, it will. \n\nA big thing with ADHD (I have it too) is that your likely to get distracted, so stop and start tasks. If you get distracted, notice the task again and feel overwhelming shame it's hugely painful, so you avoid that feeling, therefore avoiding the task. Working through that shame, so that your able to notice the thing you forgot and just go \"oh, I did want to finish that\", that's the game changer. \n\nIt needs to be ok that you stopped the task. (Which, spoiler, it is)\n\nSocietal ways of dealing with someone (both yourself and others) forgetful or easily distracted tend to involve making the person \"care\" enough about it, which means feel so bad about it you'll never do it again. You ever had that lector from yourself or others? This doesn't work in the long run and takes a LOT of dedication and time to overcome. \n\nIt's not that you don't care, it's that you're wired to be distracted and forgetful. Just have to restart a few times, and that's ok.",
        "comment_gpt4o": "Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a pretty tough challenge, but the fact that you're reaching out for advice is a great first step. Overcoming a deep-rooted aversion to discipline can be tricky, but it's definitely possible with some patience and strategy.\n\nFirst, try to reframe how you view discipline. Instead of seeing it as a rigid, external force, think of it as a tool that helps you achieve what you truly want. Start small—pick one tiny habit that you can incorporate into your daily routine. It could be as simple as playing an instrument for just 5 minutes a day or jotting down a few game ideas. The key is consistency, not intensity.\n\nAlso, consider breaking down your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Celebrate small wins to build momentum and confidence.\n\nIt might also help to find a community or accountability partner who shares your interests. Having someone to share progress with can make the journey feel less isolating and more motivating.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are part of the process. Keep experimenting with what works for you, and remember that every small step forward is a victory. You've got this!",
        "comment_gpt5": "This is beatable. The trick isn’t more willpower; it’s shrinking the work until it doesn’t feel like “discipline” and repeating that tiny dose until the reflex calms down.\n\nTry a 30‑day sprint with one craft (pick game dev or music, not both). Make a 3–5 minute micro‑ritual tied to a fixed anchor. For game dev: open the project after coffee, run it, make one shippable change (rename a variable, tweak a value, fix a tiny bug), build, push, stop. For music: metronome at 40 bpm, play one scale once or read four bars of sheet at snail pace, stop. Set a timer and actually stop when it dings. Track with a simple yes/no on a calendar. If you miss, do the next day—never miss twice. When the wall shows up, say “just the 3‑minute version,” start the timer immediately, no debate.\n\nAdd one weekly “finish tiny” rep to build the finishing muscle. Every Friday, finish and share something embarrassingly small: a 30‑second prototype, a one‑screen toy, an 8‑bar loop, a clean recording of one scale. Scope it so it fits in 30–60 minutes. Finishing is a skill; train it on trivial scope so it stops triggering the alarm.\n\nOutsource discipline with structure. Use body‑doubling (Focusmate/Discord coworking), a teacher/coach with tiny assignments, or game jams with strict constraints. Text a friend “done” after your micro‑ritual. Set up the night before so starting is frictionless: instrument out, metronome ready, IDE opens to the right file, build script on a hotkey.\n\nKeep the rule: if it starts to feel like “discipline,” make it smaller. After a week where it felt easy, nudge the timer up by a minute or two; if it spikes resistance, drop back down. Stop while it still feels safe—leaving a little in the tank makes tomorrow easier.\n\nIf this pattern comes from early conditioning, a few sessions with someone who does schema therapy or ACT can help uncouple “discipline = threat.” If ADHD is in the mix, keep meds/tools dialed in.\n\nGive this 30 days. Tiny, safe reps + weekly tiny finishes + outside structure. You’re rebuilding your relationship with work, not forcing yourself through it."
